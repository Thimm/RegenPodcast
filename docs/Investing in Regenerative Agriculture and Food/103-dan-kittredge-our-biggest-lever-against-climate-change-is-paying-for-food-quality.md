**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:00:14):**  Why are we not paying farmers for quality?  
**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:00:16):**  A long overdue interview with Dan Gittrich on their work of measuring nutrients and the  
**[0:00:20-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:00:20):**  connection to quality and taste.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:00:22):**  Plus his vision of a food and agriculture system in 2030 and why if we focus more on  
**[0:00:27-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:00:27):**  setting up structures and systems to pay farmers for quality, carbon, biodiversity and water  
**[0:00:33-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:00:33):**  will take care of itself.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:00:36):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:00:41):**  Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:00:45):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:00:50):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:00:56):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:00:58):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:02-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:01:02):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:01:05):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:01:10):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:01:14):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:18-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:01:18):**  our work.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:01:19):**  And so many of you have joined as a member.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:01:21):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:01:25):**  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.

**[0:01:38-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:01:38):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:01:40):**  Welcome to a new interview with Dan Kittrich.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:01:42):**  Our last interview was in May 2019.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:01:44):**  And I will definitely link that interview below.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:01:47):**  But I'm so happy to have Dan back on the show because so much has happened and it's really,  
**[0:01:51-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:01:51):**  really time to check in.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:01:53):**  So welcome back, Dan.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:01:54):**  Thanks for having me, Kun.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:01:55):**  Glad to be back.  
**[0:01:57-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:01:57):**  And you're walking outside.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:01:58):**  If there's some bit of background noise, you're in your hoop house.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:00):**  So you're definitely on the land.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:01):**  I'm in my hoop house, actually, if I may.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:04):**  Yes.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:05):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:06):**  Please.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:07):**  I mean, describe it at some point if you need to, to make some of the concepts more visual,  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:11):**  because obviously we're in Audioland.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:12):**  But let's all imagine a very lively green or very lively hoop house.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:17):**  What should we imagine where you are?  
**[0:02:18-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:18):**  It just snowed last night.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:20):**  And so the snow hasn't come off the top yet.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:23):**  There's spinach and greens in the beds underneath layers of remay.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:27):**  Nice mulched pathways.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:29):**  It's quiet, calm.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:30):**  It's a beautiful, beautiful place.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:33):**  Very nice place to start a podcast.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:34):**  I shouldn't ask more often where people are.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:36):**  Mostly they are at a desk or something.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:37):**  So that's not so interesting.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:39):**  So let's say, I mean, last time we did a deep dive, obviously your work at that moment,  
**[0:02:44-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:44):**  which is almost two years ago, I mean, time flies.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:46):**  Let's start with actually a short intro for anybody that has no clue what we're talking  
**[0:02:50-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:50):**  about at the moment.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:51):**  We'll listen to the other interview, but in a few minutes, what are you working on?  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:55):**  You are an organic farmer for many, many years, but what is, let's say, what have you spent  
**[0:02:59-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:59):**  the last decade on or the last five years on mostly?  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:03:01):**  What is this bio nutrient stuff that we hear so much about?  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:03:05):**  I've been an organic farmer for 30 plus years, grew up on an organic farm, so it wasn't too  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:03:09):**  hard or didn't have much choice, let's say, but haven't left it.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:03:13):**  For the last 10 years, I've been running an organization called the Bionutrient Food Association.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:03:17):**  And our mission is to increase quality in the food supply.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:03:19):**  I would say we've been leading the conversation around nutrient density, at least among the  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:03:26):**  leaders in that conversation for quite some time now.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:03:30):**  And in the past four years, we've started a collaborative venture called the Real Food  
**[0:03:34-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:03:34):**  Campaign, which is a partnership of a bunch of different other nonprofits, farmers, general  
**[0:03:41-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:03:41):**  consumers, companies, researchers, foundations, just a broad swath of allies who are interested  
**[0:03:50-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:03:50):**  in this question of nutrient density.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:03:51):**  And so we've got three things we're trying to accomplish.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:03:54):**  One is to build a handheld meter that can be used at point of purchase or anywhere,  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:03:59):**  flash a light and get a reading on the actual nutrient levels of food.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:04:04):**  That's the one objective.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:04:05):**  The second is to figure out what nutrient density is.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:04:07):**  So people throw the word around, this is nutrient dense, but we don't actually have a definition.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:04:12):**  So in my mind, it's not about like organic or not organic.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:04:16):**  It's about a continuum.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:04:17):**  So are you at the 80th percentile of what a carrot could be or the 20th percentile?  
**[0:04:21-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:04:21):**  Until we have a definition of that variation, we can't calibrate the meter to give you a  
**[0:04:27-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:04:27):**  reading that means anything.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:04:28):**  So step one, build a meter.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:04:29):**  Step two, figure out what quality is.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:04:31):**  And step three, figure out what causes it.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:04:33):**  So document all the environmental conditions, management practices, soil type, seed, microbiome.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:04:39):**  What are the dynamics that correlate with higher nutrient levels or lower nutrient levels  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:04:43):**  in crops, which we think correlate with flavor, aroma, health giving attribute, soil health,  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:04:48):**  carbon sequestration, ecosystem services.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:04:50):**  We think our hypothesis is that food quality can be a proxy for all these things and can  
**[0:04:56-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:04:56):**  be an economic lever.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:04:57):**  So we've moved along quite nicely.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:05:00):**  We started in 2017 with our first generation meter.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:05:04):**  We built our first lab in 2018 and tested a couple of different crops, carrots and spinach,  
**[0:05:07-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:05:07):**  found massive variations.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:05:09):**  2019 went to six crops and we got the first basic calibrations for our meter.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:05:15):**  2020 we did 20 crops.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:05:17):**  We've got now three labs, our main one in Michigan, one in France and one in California.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:05:22):**  And it's building and spreading.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:05:23):**  We're sort of deepening the process of understanding and starting to be recognized and engaged  
**[0:05:30-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:05:30):**  by people that you otherwise think would have credibility.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:05:33):**  Which is a good thing.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:05:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:05:35):**  So in 2019 you looked at six different crops.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:05:38):**  You said what was the most shocking results?  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:05:41):**  Was it shocking data you've seen in among the six crops or under 20 you've seen in 2020?  
**[0:05:46-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:05:46):**  But I think that some of the data still has to come out.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:05:48):**  So let's look at 2019 if that's easier.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:05:51):**  So what was the most shocking thing you've seen there?  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:05:53):**  I'm pretty sure it was antioxidants and spinach.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:05:56):**  And I think it was 364.5 to one was the variation.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:06:02):**  And what does it mean?  
**[0:06:03-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:06:03):**  Like in layman's terms?  
**[0:06:04-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:06:04):**  That means that this one leaf of spinach had as many antioxidants in it as that leaf of  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:06:11):**  spinach if you ate one of it every day for the year.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:06:15):**  So you eat this spinach, like whatever you get in the box in the store, you eat one leaf  
**[0:06:20-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:06:20):**  of that spinach every day for a year and you get the same level of antioxidants as from  
**[0:06:26-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:06:26):**  this one leaf grown differently.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:06:28):**  That's the biggest variation we found so far is literally 365X.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:06:32):**  And grown differently in this case.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:06:34):**  Did you see that connection?  
**[0:06:35-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:06:35):**  We don't know all the details.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:06:36):**  You don't know it yet.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:06:37):**  We don't.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:06:38):**  I mean, yeah, it was something is different there.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:06:40):**  Definitely a different source.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:06:41):**  So it was obviously grown differently.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:06:43):**  What were the exact things?  
**[0:06:44-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:06:44):**  I don't have that in my head.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:06:46):**  But we've been saying it's five to 10X at least on is the is the like the high to low  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:06:53):**  on minerals, copper, zinc, phosphorus, potassium in crops, this carrot to that carrot.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:06:59):**  It's not 5% or 10%.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:07:02):**  It's 5X or 10X.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:07:04):**  Huge differences.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:07:05):**  It's the mineral levels.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:07:07):**  And then when you get to these other compounds, the flavor compounds, the health giving compounds,  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:07:10):**  it's I think it's 25 to 360X.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:07:15):**  That's the range we're seeing.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:07:17):**  So nutrient variation is massive.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:07:19):**  And what does it mean?  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:07:20):**  Do we know what that means health wise for us eating it, observing it or not observing  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:07:26):**  it?  
**[0:07:27-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:07:27):**  Is there anything known or is that let's say step four after your three steps?  
**[0:07:30-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:07:30):**  Well, there's all kind of work with nutrition on omega threes and omega sixes and, you know,  
**[0:07:37-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:07:37):**  antioxidants and vitamin C. And yeah, so we do know that these nutrients are critical  
**[0:07:44-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:07:44):**  for health and, you know, the compounds as well as the elements.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:07:47):**  So I'm not sure what it is, what percentage of the world's population is zinc deficient.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:07:52):**  It's massive.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:07:53):**  Yeah, maybe a third of the world's population is zinc deficient.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:07:56):**  So if you can get grow this crop differently and you get 6X on the zinc, that's meaningful.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:08:02):**  That's massive.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:08:03):**  And did that bend looking back at that spinach, is that then the same type of spinach, the  
**[0:08:08-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:08:08):**  same type of seed?  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:08:09):**  No, it's different, different soil, different seed, different management.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:08:13):**  So what we're doing is identifying the variation and trying to tease out the correlations.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:08:18):**  So if we can say which of our many thousands of samples of crops showed up most nutrient  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:08:24):**  dense with the highest levels of nutrition in them, and then we can go back and say,  
**[0:08:28-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:08:28):**  now what were the environmental conditions that were causal?  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:08:31):**  Was it a fertility program?  
**[0:08:33-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:08:33):**  Was it management practices?  
**[0:08:34-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:08:34):**  Was it the cultivar?  
**[0:08:35-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:08:35):**  Was it the epigenetics?  
**[0:08:36-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:08:36):**  Was it the climate dynamics?  
**[0:08:37-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:08:37):**  What is epigenetics?  
**[0:08:39-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:08:39):**  Epigenetics is how the health of the mother plants affects the baby plants.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:08:46):**  So if you have three generations of ancestors that were in the presence of toxins and died  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:08:53):**  from cancer young, then your vitality is probably going to be low.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:08:57):**  And so that applies just as well for spinach seed as it does for humans.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:09:02):**  So it seems like you're in the middle.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:09:04):**  I mean, it's definitely a lot further along than 2019.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:09:08):**  The meter that we talked about last time as well, I ordered the first 3D printed version.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:09:13):**  And we're now at the end of January 2021.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:09:16):**  Where do you stand at the moment?  
**[0:09:17-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:09:17):**  What is going to happen this year?  
**[0:09:19-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:09:19):**  I think you're going to make some huge steps.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:09:22):**  It's not a linear growth anymore.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:09:24):**  But what's going to happen over the next months, over the next year with all this work around  
**[0:09:28-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:09:28):**  the Bionutrient Meter and the labs, and obviously also the data sets behind it?  
**[0:09:32-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:09:32):**  Well, I think the first generation Bionutrient Meter available for sale, I think it was the  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:09:35):**  end of 2018 and started shipping them in 2019.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:09:39):**  We only had a few hundred that we made and we pretty rapidly sold out.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:09:43):**  So now we're in our second generation and we've updated it and we've built the calibration  
**[0:09:49-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:09:49):**  standard onto it and a few other things.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:09:51):**  So now we have, and we have not just the instrument, but we have some data to calibrate it to.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:09:58):**  Meaning that we can order at like version two now or not yet?  
**[0:10:02-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:03):**  It's like it's version 1.1 or 1.2 or something.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:08):**  It's still an Apple 2.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:09):**  It's not an iPhone yet.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:11):**  But it's now it actually, you don't have to write the code.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:15):**  Now it comes with some code, right?  
**[0:10:16-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:16):**  Basically we're going to be shipping the next batch out in June of 2021 and it should have  
**[0:10:22-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:22):**  calibrations for at least six crops.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:24):**  Which one?  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:25):**  Like a red, yellow, green, carrots, spinach, lettuce, cherry tomatoes, grapes and kale,  
**[0:10:30-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:30):**  potentially a number more.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:32):**  So meaning like I'm scanning it and it gives me a green, yellow or red, meaning I'm in  
**[0:10:37-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:37):**  the highest percentile, the middle or the lowest.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:40):**  The red is the bottom quartile.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:41):**  The yellow is the middle 50% and then the green is the top quartile.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:45):**  That's roughly how we're presuming.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:47):**  That's what our statistics are giving us the numbers for.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:50):**  It's like we can reasonably well predict that.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:52):**  It's not a hundred percent.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:53):**  No, of course.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:54):**  We're not actually measuring the nutrients.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:55):**  We're predicting based on the metadata.  
**[0:10:58-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:58):**  That makes sense to people.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:59):**  No, we should explain that.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:11:00):**  What does it mean?  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:11:01):**  You're measuring it, but you're basically basing it on a metadata.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:11:05):**  What does it mean when I scan, I ordered in June and I scan my cherry tomato in July and  
**[0:11:10-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:11:10):**  it gives green.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:11:11):**  How does it get to green?  
**[0:11:12-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:11:12):**  So the first question is what is the meter and how does it work?  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:11:16):**  So there's this term spectroscopy, which is a sort of form of assessing things.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:11:22):**  I like to use the example of astronomers and they speak with great confidence about this  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:11:27):**  star has this percent hydrogen and this percent helium, this percent other elements at these  
**[0:11:32-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:11:32):**  levels and ratios.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:11:33):**  And it's not because we've ever been to a star and sampled it.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:11:37):**  It's because every element in chemistry, hydrogen or helium vibrates at a certain frequency.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:11:43):**  And so literally the light, that vibration of that star has encoded within it like the  
**[0:11:50-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:11:50):**  chemical makeup of the star.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:11:52):**  And so if we can take a picture of light from light years away and see what something's  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:11:58):**  made up of, then we can take a picture of light from something a millimeter away and  
**[0:12:02-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:12:02):**  see what something's made up of.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:12:04):**  And so basically our spectrometer, it flashes a light at the carrot or at the lettuce and  
**[0:12:09-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:12:09):**  it takes a picture of the light that bounces back.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:12:12):**  And based on a bunch of lab work that we've done where we did this with thousands of crops,  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:12:16):**  we've brought them into the lab, we've flashed the light at them, took a picture of the light  
**[0:12:20-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:12:20):**  that bounced back and then ran those crops through a sampling process where we tested  
**[0:12:24-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:12:24):**  the copper and the zinc and the antioxidants and the polyphenols and things like that.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:12:28):**  We now have enough data where we can say this structure of light or this picture of light  
**[0:12:34-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:12:34):**  means high levels of antioxidants.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:12:37):**  This one means low levels.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:12:39):**  So it's not perfect by any means, but it's...  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:12:41):**  But you read the light and know because of the lab work.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:12:45):**  Yes, exactly.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:12:46):**  So that's where we're at right now is we have taken a basic instrument, built enough metadata  
**[0:12:51-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:12:51):**  to calibrate it.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:12:52):**  Which wasn't the case before.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:12:53):**  No, no.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:12:54):**  The one in 19, I remember scanning an apple and getting some data out of it and or an  
**[0:12:59-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:12:59):**  apple, a slice of apple.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:13:01):**  And then the question is, okay, what's next?  
**[0:13:02-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:13:02):**  You get a graph.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:13:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:13:04):**  What does this graph say?  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:13:05):**  Until we can understand what it means, we don't know what it means.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:13:09):**  I knew that when I ordered it that that was going to be the results.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:13:11):**  Not that I was expecting, but I wanted to be part of that first iPhone movement as well  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:13:15):**  or the Apple one.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:13:18):**  We hope we were honest about where we're at and we have into the whole time.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:13:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:13:23):**  So now we're at a point where that graph gets converted to a reading.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:13:26):**  So that's in and of itself quite significant.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:13:28):**  And I feel very proud about that.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:13:30):**  But I think what you were asking about in your question is the next generation.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:13:34):**  So as I said before, this is an Apple two, it's not an iPhone, but we have just recently  
**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:13:40):**  gotten some significant donations to start the process of that next generation.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:13:45):**  And I would say we're going to go from a 1.1 to a 4.1.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:13:50):**  I think we're going to skip the second and third generational cycles.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:13:53):**  Wow.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:13:54):**  So how would that look like?  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:13:55):**  What should we imagine that's basically going to the Apple watch immediately or to the iPhone  
**[0:14:00-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:00):**  12?  
**[0:14:01-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:01):**  What's the version?  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:02):**  Even an iPhone one, it would be a significant accomplishment.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:08):**  What does this thing do?  
**[0:14:09-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:09):**  Fly as well?  
**[0:14:10-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:10):**  It grows food?  
**[0:14:11-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:12):**  It looks like we'll be able to actually get specific numbers on things.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:17):**  We won't just be building the calibration.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:18):**  It'll actually be a scientific instrument so we can actually test the number of the  
**[0:14:23-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:23):**  polyphenols parts per million or copper parts per million.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:27):**  Potentially it'll be able to even go down below that into parts per billion.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:31):**  That's what we're doing this year.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:32):**  Which is something that now only is possible in the lab or not possible at all?  
**[0:14:36-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:36):**  This is very much possible in the lab.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:37):**  You can go to parts per trillion in the lab if you've got the fancy equipment, but not  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:40):**  in the field or in the shop.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:42):**  It depends on how many dollars you have to spend and how heavy it is.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:46):**  Normal people or normal farmers can't.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:48):**  You can buy a $50,000, 10-pound handheld thing that will give you parts per million right  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:54):**  now.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:55):**  There's stuff out there, but to really get it down to not much bigger than a smartphone  
**[0:15:00-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:15:00):**  and at least below a couple grand, if not below $500, it'll take a couple generations.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:15:06):**  It feels like we actually are on the development path to accomplish that now.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:15:09):**  Timing?  
**[0:15:10-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:15:10):**  You mentioned significant donations, meaning you can speed up this process significantly.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:15:17):**  What did you, I wouldn't say promise the donations, but what's your timing, your hope, your timing  
**[0:15:22-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:15:22):**  for this version for?  
**[0:15:23-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:15:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:15:24):**  Well, I think based on the potentials we've got, it won't just be one.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:15:30):**  There probably will be a different version for the agronomist and farmer than there would  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:15:35):**  be for the consumer or perhaps other people in the supply chain.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:15:40):**  That's what we're going to do over the next year and see.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:15:42):**  I would expect we're going to have prototypes of some sort by the end of this year, 2021,  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:15:47):**  and I would hope that we have something marketable in 2022.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:15:50):**  I don't think that's unreasonable, but it certainly is ambitious.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:15:53):**  But yeah, for the time being, we've got our Binding Ship Meter version one that actually  
**[0:15:57-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:15:57):**  is now functional.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:15:59):**  But yeah, what is exciting is that we've always known that the version we've got right now  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:16:03):**  is never going to be the mass-produced slick consumer, easy functioning thing.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:16:08):**  It was really about like, is it possible to do this?  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:16:11):**  And I think we've pretty clearly shown it is possible.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:16:15):**  And now we're in a place to really do what we think needs to be done.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:16:18):**  So I feel very excited about that.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:16:20):**  I feel honored and blessed.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:16:22):**  And I think, you know, it could be significant.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:16:25):**  It could be very, very significant.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:16:27):**  So the field in general, looking at when we talk almost two years ago, I mean, at least  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:16:33):**  in my bubble, it seems to have exploded the attention for soil regeneration, regenerative  
**[0:16:37-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:16:37):**  agriculture approaches, practices.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:16:38):**  We see it everywhere from Walmart to Cargill to obviously the organic or the soil building  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:16:45):**  farmer at the corner.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:16:47):**  What have you seen in your niche of or your part of the nutrient discussion?  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:16:52):**  Has that changed a lot over the last years or hasn't it?  
**[0:16:56-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:16:56):**  Yeah, well, I think it's gone from a concept that people didn't agree was true, that there  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:03):**  was meaningful nutrient variation in food.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:06):**  I think that people said every carrot is more or less the same.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:10):**  And when we started 10 years ago, that was kind of what the assumption was.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:12):**  Like it wasn't even discussed really in my circles.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:15):**  And I was traveling in the organic circle for 20 years.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:18):**  Why do you think is that?  
**[0:17:20-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:20):**  Or was that?  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:21):**  Well, I mean, it just sort of when the organic started, they wanted to be able to test to  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:25):**  see if it was better, but they didn't have the ability to.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:30):**  And so it went to a sort of a practice based standard.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:33):**  Like don't do this, follow these practices, and then you get to be certified.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:37):**  You're saying if the meter was out there and the software, et cetera, at that point, organic  
**[0:17:41-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:41):**  might have taken a different street.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:43):**  I know it would have.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:44):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:45):**  I mean, my parents helped write some of the first standards in the eighties.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:47):**  Yeah, that was exactly the struggle they were having was.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:50):**  The tech wasn't there basically.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:51):**  We should be doing this because it's better, not just because it's less bad, but we don't  
**[0:17:56-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:56):**  have any way of testing better.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:58):**  So we're just going to make sure you don't do bad.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:18:00):**  Maybe a bit of a simplification, but I think it's effectively it.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:18:02):**  No, but it makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:18:04):**  And now it's different because this stuff is coming and coming up.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:18:08):**  Well, and now I think, well, what's exciting is that we have this confluence of events  
**[0:18:14-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:18:14):**  where, you know, especially with the climate conversation pushing it along.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:18:17):**  I mean, even five years ago, the climate piece wasn't so big.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:18:21):**  Nobody was talking about soil carbon five years ago.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:18:23):**  No, it really was a very small cadre of people who understood that possibility.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:18:26):**  I mean, some people have been talking about it forever, but as far as the broader conversation  
**[0:18:30-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:18:30):**  that hadn't gotten there.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:18:31):**  And so we'll say that the regenerative, the term, the movement, quote unquote, has brought  
**[0:18:37-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:18:37):**  the climate consciousness energy into what was already a very well established alternative,  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:18:43):**  sustainable, organic, permaculture, biodynamic, agroecology world.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:18:48):**  It's brought that wisdom was already there and well established.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:18:51):**  And now we've got the companies and the angst and the climate concerns and the people trying  
**[0:18:56-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:18:56):**  to make money on carbon and everything else.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:18:58):**  So when you put those two things together, the most powerful economic lever in my mind  
**[0:19:03-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:19:03):**  is the nutrient density of the food.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:19:06):**  And so that's what's exciting to me right now over the past even just a few months,  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:19:10):**  but definitely over the past couple of years is that a lot of the people that I consider  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:19:14):**  to be, you know, I think a lot of people would say are leading lights, thoughtful people,  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:19:18):**  respected voices are coming to the conclusion that nutrient density sure looks like it's  
**[0:19:23-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:19:23):**  got a lot of potential to be the economic driver that facilitates these objectives,  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:19:28):**  meaning it's not enough or maybe not even crucial to be paying for carbon storage in  
**[0:19:34-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:19:34):**  the soil as long as we're not paying for quality.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:19:37):**  Because if we do that and we can measure quality and we know what nutrient density is, I mean,  
**[0:19:41-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:19:41):**  there are a lot of ifs there.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:19:43):**  By definition or because of these practices, you will be storing carbon and restoring biodiversity  
**[0:19:48-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:19:48):**  and water storage and all of those.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:19:50):**  But it's focused on quality first.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:19:52):**  You will be doing all those things also.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:19:54):**  But the incentive for you as a farmer, I mean, it's an economics thing.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:20:00):**  You will make more money because your plants are healthier than you will from the carbon.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:20:04):**  It's a nice extra, obviously, but it's not the driver.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:20:06):**  Well, the carbon is great and ecosystem service markets are great.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:20:09):**  And I'm not saying people shouldn't get paid for it.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:20:11):**  But the more we get down to the rabbit hole of people have to look at carbon and labile  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:20:14):**  carbon and stable carbon and at, you know, 10 centimeters and at 30 centimeters, we  
**[0:20:19-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:20:19):**  understand what a complicated problem it is to try to monetize it.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:20:23):**  It's going to require any number of really whatever.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:20:27):**  I mean, that's the whole conversation.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:20:28):**  And I don't want to say people shouldn't follow it.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:20:30):**  I think it's great that that's the entranceway to a deeper conversation.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:20:34):**  That's a nice way of putting it.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:20:36):**  And then I mean, it's such a fundamental shift to look at quality instead of quantity.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:20:40):**  And obviously, we still have to look at quantity because we need to produce.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:20:43):**  But the quality discussion is every time I talk to somebody about it, it's such a quality  
**[0:20:49-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:20:49):**  and taste and the nutrients in food, etc.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:20:51):**  It's such a completely new field that people enter basically like, oh, that's actually  
**[0:20:55-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:20:55):**  possible.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:20:56):**  And of course, because you know, when people know that taste is different, but the connection  
**[0:20:59-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:20:59):**  to health and the connection to nutrients is often not not made.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:21:03):**  It's assumed it's kind of one of those things that when you say it to people are like, obviously,  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:21:07):**  that's the case, or I would be very, very surprised if it's not the case.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:21:10):**  But the fact is, we have no thoughtful systemic data to confirm or deny it.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:21:17):**  And so because we don't have the data, we can't say anything that we can just say it  
**[0:21:19-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:21:19):**  tastes wow, it is tastes amazing of this tomato I buy at the farmers market, etc.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:21:24):**  But we never dared to make the food as medicine claim after which sort of logically follows.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:21:29):**  It's there's any amount of data which would suggest that's the case, but it hasn't been  
**[0:21:34-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:21:34):**  categorically put together.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:21:36):**  And that's what we're trying to accomplish.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:21:38):**  Our thought is if we can use science to verify these things, which we are fairly certain  
**[0:21:43-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:21:43):**  are the case, then we can use economics to incentivize them and facilitate that rapid  
**[0:21:50-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:21:50):**  global transformation to a more balanced climate and culture.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:21:55):**  So what you're saying the biggest lever or the fastest potential point to kickstart or  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:22:00):**  accelerate this transition to more regenerative approaches, more regenerative farms and farmers,  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:22:05):**  more soil being regenerated is the focus of quality and paying our farmers that are doing  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:22:10):**  the right things or part of the right things or most of the right things to more because  
**[0:22:15-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:22:15):**  they grow quality and move up the rest in that process.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:22:18):**  I think it's going to end up being easier to focus on quality than to focus on carbon  
**[0:22:22-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:22:22):**  and it's going to be more economically advantageous.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:22:25):**  Let's talk a bit about a conference that's coming up.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:22:27):**  Actually, it's not a conference.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:22:28):**  Let's talk about the 10th annual Soil and Nutrition Conference.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:22:31):**  You used to do I mean, nine times, obviously, otherwise, it's not the 10th, a big conference  
**[0:22:36-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:22:36):**  focusing on all of these topics and really pushing the agenda here.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:22:39):**  Obviously, in COVID times, a big conference isn't happening.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:22:42):**  You've chosen a different route.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:22:44):**  Can you elaborate a bit on that?  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:22:46):**  Yeah, well, I think we've, you know, looked at the ecosystem and said, there's a whole  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:22:51):**  bunch of people doing two day intensives in December, January, February and March, at  
**[0:22:56-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:22:56):**  least in the northern hemisphere.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:22:58):**  So let's not try to compete in that space.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:23:01):**  You know, what's not being done.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:23:03):**  And so I think it's the like the podcast style is something that comes out every week.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:23:09):**  What we're planning on doing is we had a bunch of speakers lined up amazing speakers.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:23:13):**  Yeah, well, we try to usually get speakers.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:23:15):**  I was very impressed.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:23:17):**  I was bummed that I could travel and go.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:23:20):**  Yeah, instead of having them be across from each other.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:23:23):**  So four things at a time, or five things at a time, all over two days, we said, let's  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:23:27):**  give each person enough space to get so they get an hour and a half instead of an hour.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:23:33):**  And they get everybody at the whole conference can listen to them and pose questions to them.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:23:38):**  And we'll spread it out over the year.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:23:39):**  So basically, what we have is over the next eight months, starting beginning of February,  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:23:45):**  a webinar series, which we're calling the 10th annual soil nutrition conference, which  
**[0:23:49-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:23:49):**  is, you know, got four sort of tracks.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:23:51):**  One is the real food campaign.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:23:53):**  So everything we're doing with the testing and the meter and the science and the farm  
**[0:23:57-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:23:57):**  partners and how you can engage and collaborate.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:23:59):**  And a second one is the agronomy track.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:24:01):**  So principles of best management practice, one is the nutrition track.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:24:05):**  So what we understand about how we can correlate this to our health, etc, etc.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:24:10):**  And then the final one is what we're calling mycelial culture.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:24:13):**  So thinking about decolonizing our minds, our culture, the wisdom about the indigenous  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:24:20):**  perspective, and what is that?  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:24:23):**  And how can those of us who were not brought up in it, you know, step back and tune into  
**[0:24:27-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:24:27):**  what I think is intuitive for all of us.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:24:29):**  It's just a question of whether we had the nurture in our childhood of that.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:24:33):**  I think we've got this is part of what is exciting about the regenerative community  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:24:36):**  is very much aligned with these deeper symbiotic principles.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:24:42):**  And so that's our fourth track.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:24:44):**  And so we basically have these different speakers from different tracks that are going to be  
**[0:24:47-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:24:47):**  alternating from February to September.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:24:50):**  And we've gotten amazing registrations from people all over the planet.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:24:53):**  That's going to be quite an exciting.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:24:55):**  Where can people find out more?  
**[0:24:57-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:24:57):**  Soilandnutrition.org.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:24:58):**  I will definitely put it in the shownet.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:25:02):**  Scholarships are available.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:25:04):**  And we have got a global community price of $21 for anybody who's not in Europe, North  
**[0:25:10-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:25:10):**  America or Australia, New Zealand.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:25:12):**  So if you're from South America, Africa, Asia, then it's $21.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:25:18):**  And if that's too much for you, we've got scholarships for you also.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:25:20):**  So yeah, I'm not sure if the Oxford Real Farming Conference did a really wonderful job, I think.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:25:25):**  Spread it out over a week, basically.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:25:28):**  But they got 5000 people and they had a global price.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:25:31):**  And they really had speakers from 500 presenters.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:25:33):**  Yeah, it was massive.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:25:35):**  5000 attendees.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:25:36):**  A really, really wonderful model for I think a lot of the other organizations about how  
**[0:25:40-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:25:40):**  to broaden the base.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:25:42):**  Let's take the privilege we've had of going to these conferences that cost hundreds of  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:25:46):**  thousands of dollars to go to at the end of it and make that community knowledge share  
**[0:25:51-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:25:51):**  process available to everyone on the planet.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:25:53):**  That feels like a really wonderful opportunity.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:25:55):**  I think they did an amazing job.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:25:57):**  I'm sure you're doing as well to really rethink what that conference meant and bring it completely  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:26:03):**  online, obviously, but then make it incredibly accessible and completely shifting also what  
**[0:26:08-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:26:08):**  presenters meant there.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:26:10):**  Because before, obviously, it was only the people that could travel to Oxford or to the  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:26:13):**  UK or in this case to you as well that could present and most of the people can't.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:26:19):**  And so they did an incredible job of completely switching it from UK focus, mostly UK focus  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:26:24):**  to global and an incredible array of presenters and audience that responded and joined.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:26:29):**  So yeah, that's what we're up to is we're spreading it out.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:26:33):**  Which is great.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:26:34):**  I mean, you can bite size pieces is probably better than a full two day deep dive and the  
**[0:26:39-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:26:39):**  community piece.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:26:40):**  I'm sure that will come back like the privilege of spending time together quality time offline  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:26:44):**  will be hopefully something we cherish much more, but will happen in smaller groups in  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:26:49):**  hopefully on nice locations on nice farms, etc. to do that, but the online piece just  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:26:54):**  makes it much more accessible for all.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:26:56):**  Well, that's one other exciting piece of news we have at the BFA is that we're about to  
**[0:27:00-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:27:00):**  get our hands on a 360 acre farm here in Massachusetts as a to have as a education demonstration  
**[0:27:08-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:27:08):**  research hub, which is, you know, in my mind, going to be, you know, in large part, helping  
**[0:27:14-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:27:14):**  to provide farmer training and farm tenure, land access, land tenure to people who want  
**[0:27:20-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:27:20):**  to be part of that transition.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:27:22):**  So in my mind, at this point, it's not that we haven't figured a lot of things out.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:27:28):**  It's that we don't have the structure of local dissemination on the ground.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:27:32):**  I think it's one thing to learn things and in podcasts and recordings, and that's really  
**[0:27:37-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:27:37):**  wonderful.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:27:38):**  And so it's a great support to people that are kind of out in the wilderness, but it's  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:27:41):**  only scratches the surface.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:27:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:27:43):**  We need a hub, every county in every country on the planet.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:27:47):**  We need a demonstration site in a 10 or 20 mile radius or ish globally where we're actually  
**[0:27:53-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:27:53):**  implementing and training and grounding.  
**[0:27:56-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:27:56):**  As far as I'm concerned, it's not the first time it comes up.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:27:59):**  It comes up actually on the podcast, which is very interesting.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:02):**  So we're going to have one and we're going to do what we can to model everything and  
**[0:28:05-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:05):**  share as much as possible.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:06):**  And what's the current, what are the management approaches or agriculture approaches currently  
**[0:28:11-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:11):**  on that farm?  
**[0:28:12-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:12):**  Like how extreme is going to be the shift?  
**[0:28:14-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:14):**  That's my question.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:15):**  It's been hay for the last 20 years.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:17):**  It was actually on the Olympic trials.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:20):**  It was owned by horse people and made to look really fancy.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:23):**  Prior to that, it was a dairy farm for 200 years.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:25):**  That's going to be a shift.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:27):**  It's a beautiful canvas.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:28):**  Do a lot of sampling before you change the management practices because it's going to  
**[0:28:32-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:32):**  be a very interesting sample size.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:34):**  Our intention is to really engage a thoughtful scientific process and to document any number  
**[0:28:40-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:40):**  of different little experiments.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:43):**  If we've got the lab equipment to be able to test all kinds of stuff in real time, we  
**[0:28:47-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:47):**  can have all kinds of little experiments going on.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:49):**  Wow.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:51):**  I don't know.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:52):**  So that'll be fun.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:53):**  A question that I, not recently, but I've been asking, I think after we recorded our  
**[0:28:57-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:57):**  previous podcast, it's been a regular, but I haven't asked it to you yet.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:00):**  I think, and it's a bit of a mind shift there.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:04):**  Imagine you wake up tomorrow morning, I mean, now you're waking up to also a massive farm  
**[0:29:07-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:07):**  and actually you're getting some interesting donations in.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:09):**  But let's say for a moment we push that aside and you are an investment manager and you  
**[0:29:14-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:14):**  actually have a billion dollar investment fund under your management.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:17):**  You can invest that whatever shape or form, et cetera, you like.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:21):**  It is meant to be an investment or investments, meaning it should come back at some point,  
**[0:29:26-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:26):**  but the duration and the returns, et cetera, are up to you.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:29):**  I'm asking these questions to people because I'm very interested in the decision making  
**[0:29:32-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:32):**  framework.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:33):**  What do people prioritize?  
**[0:29:35-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:35):**  What do they focus on?  
**[0:29:36-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:36):**  I'm not so interested if you're going to invest.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:38):**  Like what's the exact breakdown of what you would do, but I'm very interested, would you  
**[0:29:41-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:41):**  prioritize if you had a large investment fund at your disposal tomorrow morning?  
**[0:29:46-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:47):**  Well, you sent me that email with that question a couple hours ago and I certainly haven't  
**[0:29:51-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:51):**  gotten to the point where I haven't answered that question.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:54):**  I can take a couple of shots, but I haven't really meditated on it.  
**[0:29:57-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:57):**  The first thing that comes up is usually the best.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:59):**  Well, the first thing that came up was that, you know, let's replicate what we're doing  
**[0:30:02-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:30:02):**  here with this big piece of land.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:30:05):**  And I think education is massively important.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:30:08):**  You know, what I feel like we're doing is the most important thing.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:30:11):**  So the nutrient density piece, documenting, verifying, calibrating, whatever it is, establishing  
**[0:30:19-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:30:19):**  some empirical framework around this deeper conversation so that any number of other businesses  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:30:26):**  can succeed by leading in this space feels like a very valuable investment.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:30:31):**  Our struggle has been that because we're a nonprofit, we only do this off charitable  
**[0:30:35-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:30:35):**  donations for the commons.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:30:37):**  We want all that core information to be in the commons and not to be proprietary controlled.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:30:41):**  So that's going to be counter to the incentives of somebody looking for an ROI because we're  
**[0:30:45-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:30:45):**  not offering any.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:30:46):**  You would invest it in other hubs, basically like the one you're building now, which could  
**[0:30:50-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:30:50):**  be, I mean, very interesting investment, very long term, but definitely, I mean, people  
**[0:30:54-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:30:54):**  have done very interesting things in education.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:30:57):**  There's a group out here in Massachusetts and Western Mass that's, you know, been a  
**[0:31:00-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:31:00):**  little bit inspired by a group in Vermont, but they're looking at the food system regionally  
**[0:31:05-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:31:05):**  and saying, where are the holes?  
**[0:31:08-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:31:08):**  Like the slaughterhouses, the creameries, the commercial kitchens, whatever it is, what  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:31:14):**  are the infrastructural holes in the system that are keeping the local farmer community  
**[0:31:19-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:31:19):**  from being economically viable?  
**[0:31:21-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:31:21):**  So there's a ton of relatively small investments in any regional ecosystem that could intelligently  
**[0:31:29-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:31:29):**  be made that would actually probably spin off reasonable return.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:31:33):**  But I think to do that right probably would require having a base in that community first  
**[0:31:39-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:31:39):**  to be able to discern what its needs are.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:31:40):**  And I know there's various funds that are looking at this kind of a model, but I think  
**[0:31:45-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:31:45):**  I would say engage in the networks that you're part of in an active way.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:31:49):**  If you can get your hands on a big piece of land and you can begin to implement practices  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:31:52):**  and produce crops that will give you good, reasonable profits, then if it's only 2% or  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:31:57):**  5% you're looking for, you want a reasonable return, but you're creating all amount of  
**[0:32:01-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:32:01):**  cultural value, I would say that's how you should be thinking about your returns on a  
**[0:32:05-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:32:05):**  billion dollar investment.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:32:06):**  I mean, I'm not a, I don't have much money at all, but I don't think you'd need that  
**[0:32:09-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:32:09):**  much money.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:32:11):**  And the question is when you do have that much money, how do you use it most well for  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:32:14):**  the greatest good, not just for the ROI in a capital standpoint?  
**[0:32:18-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:32:18):**  I think it's an excellent answer.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:32:19):**  And actually it's an interesting segue into something I wanted to ask as well is because  
**[0:32:25-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:32:25):**  you mentioned briefly on the Q and A webinar we just did, your vision for agriculture.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:32:29):**  And it's interesting because you just got your hands on a big piece of land and your  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:32:32):**  vision that you laid out there, but I would love to hear it here again, or a bit more  
**[0:32:36-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:32:36):**  elaborated because we had a few minutes only left is actually not necessarily gigantic  
**[0:32:41-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:32:41):**  farms.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:32:42):**  What is your vision?  
**[0:32:43-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:32:43):**  Let's say we're now in 2021.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:32:45):**  So in nine years, so the decade to the end of the decade, what do you see if a lot of  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:32:50):**  the things we've discussed will happen around quality, around focus, obviously on soil,  
**[0:32:55-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:32:55):**  what do you see happening for the next nine years and what's your idea there?  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:32:59):**  Well, I think broadly, I mean, I've always said that this nutrient density thing and  
**[0:33:04-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:33:04):**  the spectrometer is just a shiny object.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:33:06):**  This is a little thing to catch people's attention to bring them down a rabbit hole that will  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:33:11):**  provide all kinds of wonderful, you know, a path that's very inspiring.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:33:16):**  So for me, the end game looks like to some degree, more of a traditional human civilization  
**[0:33:24-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:33:24):**  with culture and with community and with relationship with land.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:33:29):**  And I would say with some level of empowerment and agency as well, I think to a large degree  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:33:33):**  is missing in the colonized culture.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:33:37):**  I would like to see people supported in having land tenure, in having some level of self  
**[0:33:45-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:33:45):**  sufficiency.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:33:46):**  I'm not saying that the only thing you do to make your living is grow food.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:33:50):**  But if you can have access to land where you can provide a lot of your needs, then the  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:33:55):**  actual money you need is much less and your agency, your freedom, your safety is much  
**[0:34:00-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:34:00):**  greater.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:34:01):**  Which we all learned last year.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:34:04):**  This has been a beautiful process in showing the profound vulnerability of the current  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:34:09):**  system, which people always knew in the back of their mind, but you know, whatever, it  
**[0:34:13-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:34:13):**  was fine now.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:34:15):**  And I think we've been trained to be cogs in an industrial wheel.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:34:19):**  We have been removed from our relationship to land, to elders, to tradition, to culture,  
**[0:34:24-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:34:24):**  to a large degree.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:34:25):**  Not everybody has to be a farmer.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:34:27):**  But I think if we have many, many more people on the land, in chunks of land that are smaller,  
**[0:34:34-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:34:34):**  5, 10, 20 acres, it's going to be a different level of empowerment broadly.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:34:41):**  If somebody in your family has land, it's not you, then you've got access to that.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:34:45):**  Then there's all kinds of things that are possible.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:34:47):**  This is one of those things you bring people out of the city and onto the land and you  
**[0:34:50-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:34:50):**  watch them and they go through all these processes of deep, profound experience, tears.  
**[0:34:57-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:34:57):**  It's a really interesting process.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:34:58):**  And I think that's where we're heading is culturally revitalization.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:35:02):**  I think with the insights we have about how we can re-green the massive areas of the continents  
**[0:35:08-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:35:08):**  that are brown, we can look at this from a global standpoint and see the opportunity  
**[0:35:11-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:35:11):**  there to move towards much greater empowerment.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:35:15):**  And as people feel that agency and ownership and they have the cultural strength, they  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:35:19):**  will be able to manage the land most well to re-green it, to re-engage the water cycle,  
**[0:35:24-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:35:24):**  to much more actively facilitate way more carbon sequestration than it would have occurred  
**[0:35:28-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:35:28):**  in a big monoculture.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:35:31):**  We need to deal with the environmental issues.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:35:34):**  We need to deal with the cultural issues.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:35:35):**  And I think that that comes foundationally with more people being in deeper relationship  
**[0:35:41-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:35:41):**  with land.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:35:42):**  So that's what we're going to try to accomplish with our piece of property is use it as a  
**[0:35:45-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:35:45):**  training education site.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:35:47):**  We've got regional land trusts immediately adjacent and in very close proximity that have  
**[0:35:53-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:35:53):**  thousands of acres here in central Massachusetts that they are trying to get people to take  
**[0:35:58-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:35:58):**  99-year leases on and nobody wants it.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:36:02):**  We could facilitate in this one town with this one land trust, 80 people each having  
**[0:36:08-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:36:08):**  10 acres.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:36:09):**  That's massive in Massachusetts.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:36:12):**  And so act locally, think globally and good living coming up to land.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:36:16):**  There's all these people that are looking for an ultimate lifestyle and structure.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:36:21):**  Let's facilitate that education.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:36:23):**  In large part, people have not been brought up in the land and their practical skill sets  
**[0:36:27-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:36:27):**  are very low.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:36:29):**  So we need to facilitate that training, including most people.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:36:33):**  I'm born in the city center and I definitely, you're a product of the culture.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:36:38):**  My skill set is not on the land.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:36:40):**  That's fascinating.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:36:41):**  And what I especially find, I mean, many more people have said similar things.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:36:47):**  We need more, I mean, we need more people on the land and it always stays sort of as  
**[0:36:52-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:36:52):**  a wish, like the move to the land piece, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:36:54):**  But what it's fascinating about your work is one of the underlying principles is it  
**[0:36:58-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:36:58):**  needs to be more profitable to be a good farmer or to be a good soil farmer.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:37:02):**  And for that, we need to focus on quality.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:37:04):**  Like there's a very practical X step and the steps could be many, many, many, but if we  
**[0:37:08-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:37:08):**  don't pay for quality, if we don't know even what quality is and we don't start paying  
**[0:37:12-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:37:12):**  and finding those farmers or those collectives that are doing a great job of managing their  
**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:37:17):**  soil and thus managing their, the health coming and the taste coming off their farms, then  
**[0:37:22-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:37:22):**  we can wish that everybody goes back to the land, but, or many goes back to the land,  
**[0:37:25-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:37:25):**  but it sort of is impractical.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:37:26):**  But that one lever of quality can really unlock many farm lives.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:37:31):**  It can help leverage it.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:37:32):**  It's not that we don't already know how to grow plants well and you don't have to have  
**[0:37:36-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:37:36):**  a label like organic or nutrient dense.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:37:39):**  If your customers are looking for quality, they'll choose your stuff over anybody else's.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:37:43):**  And when your plants are healthier, your cost of production is lower.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:37:46):**  That was my experience being a much more active farmer than I am now.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:37:50):**  You know, the last couple of years that the organization has just gotten too big and so  
**[0:37:53-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:37:53):**  I had to do much less farming than I was recently.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:37:55):**  But my experience farming is that when your plants are healthy, your cost of production  
**[0:37:59-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:37:59):**  is lower and you don't need to charge top dollar and your profitability is higher.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:38:04):**  But I grew up on a farm and I've got that sort of 30 years of experience.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:38:08):**  So if we can use the research process to document which management practices and which environmental  
**[0:38:14-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:38:14):**  conditions are most appropriate and share that openly globally, and we can have begin  
**[0:38:18-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:38:18):**  to have some of these economic levers in place and we can correlate that with local demonstration  
**[0:38:22-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:38:22):**  practice sites and you know, and tenure.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:38:27):**  I think we can align a number of really powerful incentives and the cultural upheaval over  
**[0:38:32-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:38:32):**  the past year has been a perfect preparation for that.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:38:34):**  It's really caused a lot of people to think deeply about where they are and what they  
**[0:38:38-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:38:38):**  want to do with themselves.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:38:39):**  And what would you say to like, what do you tell investors that are listening?  
**[0:38:44-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:38:44):**  I mean, I asked this about a question last time, but I'm curious if the answer has changed  
**[0:38:49-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:38:49):**  or if you have any other, like what people that are thinking deep about themselves, what  
**[0:38:53-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:38:53):**  they want to do, not only with their hands in terms of land.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:38:56):**  I think many people I know with wealth as well want to be practically involved and I  
**[0:39:00-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:39:00):**  think that's amazing.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:39:01):**  But the second part is what should they or could they be doing with their wealth?  
**[0:39:05-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:39:05):**  Where should they be looking or not looking?  
**[0:39:07-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:39:07):**  What would you tell them to, because many more people have spent the last year forcefully  
**[0:39:12-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:39:12):**  thinking a lot, where would they look to start deploying to become active if you have, let's  
**[0:39:17-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:39:17):**  say more than average wealth and you want to put that to work?  
**[0:39:20-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:39:20):**  You know, it's not a circle I travel in.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:39:22):**  That's why I'm asking it.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:39:23):**  I hear about all these things that are out there.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:39:27):**  As far as I'm concerned, I have to go back.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:39:30):**  So I really believe in what I'm doing.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:39:32):**  What we're doing with this data collection openly to build structure in a sort of a precompetitive  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:39:38):**  space kind of manner, I think is going to leverage billions and billions of dollars  
**[0:39:43-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:39:43):**  worth of profits.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:39:44):**  So I'm trying to do all the work that I can to create a structure where all those investments,  
**[0:39:49-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:39:49):**  if they're really supporting good work, will become more profitable.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:39:53):**  So this is the time to get on the quality bandwagon.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:39:56):**  I would say take 1% of your investment money and donate it to the BFA and we'll have the  
**[0:40:00-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:40:00):**  interest to you faster.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:40:01):**  That's a good answer.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:40:02):**  I mean, this space needs support.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:40:04):**  And at the same time, it's going to unlock an enormous potential and it's going to show  
**[0:40:09-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:40:09):**  a lot of things on food quality that we maybe didn't want to know.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:40:13):**  We sort of always knew, but we don't really want to.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:40:16):**  But it's also going to create an incredible space over the next year.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:40:20):**  So I think it's extremely exciting.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:40:21):**  The sooner we figure this out, the sooner we'll be able to really support the transition,  
**[0:40:26-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:40:26):**  not just make money.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:40:27):**  Ideally, not just doing this to make money, doing this because we want to facilitate a  
**[0:40:31-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:40:31):**  better world.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:40:32):**  So I think having that empirical framework where we can categorically connect environmental  
**[0:40:37-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:40:37):**  conditions, management practices, soil health, ecosystem function, farm viability, nutrient  
**[0:40:42-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:40:42):**  levels, human health, the more we can tie those things together empirically in a really  
**[0:40:47-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:40:47):**  confident fashion, the faster and more successful this transition will be.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:40:52):**  I think it's a perfect place to end.  
**[0:40:54-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:40:54):**  I want to thank you so much for your time again, to check in, to share where you're  
**[0:40:58-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:40:58):**  at.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:40:59):**  I will definitely check the version 1.1 in June later this year.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:03):**  Will it be basically like, can I use my current version?  
**[0:41:06-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:06):**  So will it just be a software update or do I have to get a new one?  
**[0:41:09-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:09):**  Well, we have built into it a calibration metric.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:13):**  We didn't have a way to sort of bring it to zero.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:15):**  I like to use the example of the kitchen scale.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:18):**  The tar button.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:19):**  Yeah, the tar button.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:20):**  We've got a tar button on it now.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:21):**  That's exactly what we've got.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:23):**  So other than that, it's the same thing.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:25):**  People who do have the previous versions, it might just be easier for you to send it  
**[0:41:29-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:29):**  back and we will update it and send it back to you and it won't cost that much.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:32):**  Okay, that's a good point.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:34):**  But the version 1.1 meters, we do have only a limited number of boards.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:39):**  So they're available for sale now and I expect it will be sold out of them long before June  
**[0:41:44-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:44):**  when we start shipping them.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:46):**  Get your hands on one if you want to.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:48):**  If enough people pre-order, then we may get other batch of boards from Asia.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:51):**  But right now there's limited supply.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:53):**  Perfect.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:54):**  Get your hands on some.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:55):**  Not to be trying to be a marketing person.  
**[0:41:57-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:57):**  No, no.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:58):**  I mean, if it's the truth, I mean, then it's good marketing and good sales.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:42:02):**  Get your hands on one if you want to.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:42:04):**  We're not trying to mass produce these things.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:42:06):**  We're doing them in batches of hundreds and we don't have the consumer meter yet.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:42:11):**  This is an iterative process, but there are only a few hundred out there in the world.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:42:15):**  I'm very excited to have one.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:42:16):**  So that's and I'm definitely going to upgrade it.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:42:18):**  So thank you so much then for your time.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:42:21):**  And I wish you a great day.

**[0:43:59-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:43:59):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question

**[0:44:08-0:44:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:44:08):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:44:53-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:44:53):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office

**[0:45:06-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:45:06):**  No.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:45:07):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:45:10):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:45:15-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:45:15):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:45:19):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:45:24-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:45:24):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:45:27):**  Thank you.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:45:28):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:45:29-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:45:29):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:45:36-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:45:36):**  so you don't have to write along.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:45:38):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:45:43-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:45:43):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:45:48-0:45:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:45:48):**  invest in, what kind of co investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:45:53-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:45:53):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:45:54):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:45:59-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:45:59):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:46:03):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:46:08):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:46:09-0:46:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:46:09):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:46:11):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:46:13):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:46:17):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:46:19):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:46:24):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

**[0:00:27-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:00:27):**  and they cannot leave their land in a healthier state to their children.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:00:30):**  Oswaldo is on a mission to change that and he explains how.

**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:00:35):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:00:40):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:00:42):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:00:47):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:00:52):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:56-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:00:56):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:59-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:00:59):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:02-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:01:02):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:01:05):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:01:10):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:01:15):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:19-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:01:19):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:01:22):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:01:25):**  There are more interviews, there are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative  
**[0:01:29-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:01:29):**  food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:01:31):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:01:35):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.

**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:01:55):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:01:56):**  So welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:02:01):**  I'm Koen van Zeyen, your host, and in the podcast of the day I'm joined by Oswaldo  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:02:04):**  De Falco, co-founder of Be Your Farm, a platform connecting you with organic fruit growers  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:02:09):**  all over Italy.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:02:10):**  You can adopt a tree, a fruit tree, and receive the fruit at home and make sure the farmers  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:02:15):**  receive a fair price.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:02:17):**  Welcome Oswaldo!  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:02:18):**  Welcome Koen, thank you.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:02:19):**  So to start with a personal question.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:02:21):**  How does somebody who comes from Calabria but then starts working in Milan, starts a  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:02:26):**  platform to sell organic fruit directly to consumers?  
**[0:02:30-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:02:30):**  Well, my story starts three years ago when I quit my job as a financial consultant in  
**[0:02:38-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:02:38):**  Milan and I decided to go back to my hometown in Calabria in the south of Italy in order  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:02:45):**  to support and help my father.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:02:49):**  He's a small organic farmer and basically when I arrived there I discovered how hard  
**[0:02:57-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:02:57):**  it is for a local farmer to be competitive in a huge market such as the market of fruit  
**[0:03:08-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:03:08):**  is today.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:03:10):**  So I was thinking how is possible to help my father, so basically a local farmer, to  
**[0:03:19-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:03:19):**  stay alive, to not lose money and not risk to lose the crops.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:03:27):**  Because you know in Italy for example there is a study that shows how the 5% of small  
**[0:03:36-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:03:36):**  local farmers every year leave the crops because they are not economically sustainable.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:03:44):**  So my aim was to do something in order to improve the income of my local farmer.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:03:56):**  But to the other side I lived for 10 years in different cities so I saw what people like.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:04:07):**  People today, the smart consumers today, they want to enjoy the real flavor of the fruit,  
**[0:04:16-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:04:16):**  they want to know where the food comes from, they want to be sure about the fruit, safe  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:04:23):**  and they want to also be sustainable when they buy fruit.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:04:29):**  So I was thinking how to match the need of local farmers, small local farmers to be sustainable,  
**[0:04:37-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:04:37):**  to be profitable with no skills and no possibility to reach far away markets.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:04:46):**  And the other side I was thinking how to help people to receive, to enjoy real fresh organic  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:04:54):**  fruit in a sustainable way, being sure about the region and the quality of it.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:04:59):**  So I thought that the best way for everyone should be for the consumers, I mean to grow  
**[0:05:07-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:05:07):**  their own fruit.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:05:09):**  But of course it's not always possible because you know people who live in the city they  
**[0:05:15-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:05:15):**  have no space or no time or no possibility to grow their fruit.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:05:22):**  So I said okay we have the technology, we have the skills to share what's happening  
**[0:05:29-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:05:29):**  in our lives.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:05:30):**  So why we don't connect local farmers with consumers, with clients in order to create  
**[0:05:40-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:05:40):**  a trust and a relationship between the local farmers that have a need and the smart consumer  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:05:51):**  that have another needs complementary to the farmer needs.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:05:55):**  So basically I thought that with an emotional task, an emotional activity like the adoption,  
**[0:06:05-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:06:05):**  we can do it.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:06:06):**  So basically we created like the farmer spin-off to start a platform where people can adopt  
**[0:06:19-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:06:19):**  organic trees from local farmers and they can follow and monitoring the cultivation,  
**[0:06:29-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:06:29):**  the growing of their crops, of their trees, how thanks to the farmers that share like  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:06:38):**  a social what's happening in the crops.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:06:42):**  So basically from a side there is a farmer that share the farming activity and the growing  
**[0:06:49-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:06:49):**  process with the simple app.  
**[0:06:51-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:06:51):**  The other side when you client adopt a tree you can follow your farmer and the farming  
**[0:07:00-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:07:00):**  process so you see how your oranges come from, how your oranges grow and then you are able  
**[0:07:10-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:07:10):**  to receive wherever you are in a few hours, in 24 hours a real fresh fruit with an extraordinary  
**[0:07:20-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:07:20):**  taste and you are sure what this fruit come from and you know the hands of the farmer  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:07:28):**  that let you enjoy this fruit.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:07:31):**  In the same time you are also supporting a local farmer so it's something like a win-win  
**[0:07:38-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:07:38):**  relationship that we created and in the same way I helped my father to improve the income  
**[0:07:46-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:07:46):**  and I helped the clients, the first users to be satisfied about the quality and the  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:07:57):**  origin about the fruit they received.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:08:01):**  I think it's an extremely, you are touching on an extremely important point in regenerative  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:08:06):**  agriculture, agriculture in general, it's paying the farmer and paying the farmer for  
**[0:08:11-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:08:11):**  all his or her work on maintaining and taking care of the land and in this case trees.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:08:18):**  Can you talk a bit more about just the, because your father is an organic orange farmer but  
**[0:08:26-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:08:26):**  still he couldn't really survive while he was selling to the major distribution channels  
**[0:08:32-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:08:32):**  etc.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:08:33):**  Can you explain a bit more for the listeners that don't know how that works when you are  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:08:37):**  growing oranges all year, you are selling them somewhere in the winter, how much do  
**[0:08:42-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:08:42):**  you get more or less, when do you get that or how little do you get obviously?  
**[0:08:46-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:08:46):**  Yeah basically I can speak about citrus fruit but now I saw by adding other farmers on our  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:08:57):**  platform that is the same issues for all local farmers.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:09:02):**  So basically the local farmer, the small farmer one works entirely here to grow in an organic  
**[0:09:11-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:09:11):**  way, oranges for example with a lot of risks, I mean weather risk or natural risks that  
**[0:09:20-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:09:20):**  can destroy, totally destroy your production and your work for a year.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:09:27):**  So basically as a farmer my father cultivate and let oranges grows and in the hand in the  
**[0:09:36-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:09:36):**  winter he used to sell the oranges for an amount that is 20, 25 cents per kilo, it's  
**[0:09:49-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:09:49):**  the same oranges or clementines.  
**[0:09:51-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:09:51):**  And the paradox is that in Milan where I was working I was seeing the same fruits sold  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:10:03):**  for 3 euros and 50 per kilo.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:10:08):**  So just to be clear going from 20, 25 cents to 3 euro 50 in what is it 6, 7, no maybe  
**[0:10:16-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:10:16):**  a thousand kilometers.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:10:18):**  Exactly but the problem is not just thousand kilometers, the problem is that the fruit  
**[0:10:25-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:10:25):**  before to arrive to the supermarket or the grocery basically it's spend something like  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:10:35):**  more than 100 hours of journey.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:10:39):**  So if on Monday your farmer pick the fruit, on Friday the fruit arrive to the supermarket  
**[0:10:49-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:10:49):**  but it's not enough because the supermarket can stock your fruit for up to 12 months.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:10:56):**  Okay it's depend of the fruit for example the apple can be stocked for one year, oranges  
**[0:11:02-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:11:02):**  for two months, it's depend.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:11:04):**  But for sure it's not fresh.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:11:06):**  Exactly and you are paying like 15 times more for a fruit that is 10 times less fresh.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:11:13):**  So it's a paradox.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:11:14):**  Why if you have the technology to reach your farmer and let him send you the fruit and  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:11:21):**  you in the same time you support him, you save money and you improve the chain.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:11:26):**  And so what was the response when you built the first version of the platform which for  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:11:31):**  sure looked a lot different than the one now but what was the, do you still remember your  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:11:36):**  first customers and what was their response when the box of fruit arrived, when the box  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:11:41):**  of oranges arrived at their home or their office?  
**[0:11:46-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:11:46):**  Okay so basically the first users, how I like to speak about them, I mean I like to call  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:11:57):**  my clients, our clients, users and not clients.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:12:02):**  By the way the first users we had they were the parents of my friends.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:12:12):**  So in the beginning it was yes happy but I already knew that they were happy because  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:12:19):**  I know my fruit and I knew them.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:12:23):**  So basically the first real feedbacks from the real customers, strangers, came after  
**[0:12:37-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:12:37):**  the first months with the word of mouth basically because we didn't invest nothing.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:12:44):**  And it was extraordinary because it was really cool to see how people that I didn't know  
**[0:12:55-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:12:55):**  paid like six months before receiving the fruit just because they liked the idea and  
**[0:13:03-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:13:03):**  how they were engaged with the farmer, they shared on Facebook the new updates from the  
**[0:13:15-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:13:15):**  crops and they wrote an email to the farmer that say hey how are you thanks to invent  
**[0:13:26-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:13:26):**  this new model and the most cool thing was when they received the fruit because they  
**[0:13:37-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:13:37):**  start to share with us on social media this huge, because the first packs were huge, the  
**[0:13:47-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:13:47):**  huge pack of box of fruit, fresh fruit and it was really satisfying to see that the day  
**[0:14:01-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:14:01):**  before I was in the crop to pick the fruit and the day after a lot of people in Milan,  
**[0:14:09-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:14:09):**  in Rome, all around the county were in the beginning they were just a few hundreds but  
**[0:14:16-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:14:16):**  it was really beautiful for me, it was really good for me to see how they were happy and  
**[0:14:24-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:14:24):**  how they were happy that they were sure to give the fresh fruit to the child, I mean  
**[0:14:32-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:14:32):**  they start to share pictures of the sons, daughters with the fruit and they were sure  
**[0:14:40-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:14:40):**  because they knew that the oranges, the clementines, the lemons were without pesticides, without  
**[0:14:47-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:14:47):**  nothing and they were so sure because they knew the farmer, the local farmer, they received  
**[0:14:54-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:14:54):**  the fruit from the tree so it was amazing and it's still amazing to see how now more  
**[0:15:04-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:15:04):**  than 1000 users share pictures, share trees, share the happiness they have with beer farm  
**[0:15:18-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:15:18):**  so for me it's really, really, how to say, I feel proud of myself not because I start  
**[0:15:31-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:15:31):**  a new business model, not for money because we are not profitable yet but I'm proud of  
**[0:15:37-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:15:37):**  me because with one idea I let farmers and users be happy together so it's amazing.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:15:51):**  And what was the response of the farmer, your father, to these people in far away places  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:15:57):**  like Milan being so happy with his fruit?  
**[0:16:02-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:16:02):**  Well, in the beginning my father, to be honest, he didn't understand what I was doing but  
**[0:16:11-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:16:11):**  after he saw that the money started to come he asked me what are you doing Osvaldo and  
**[0:16:21-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:16:21):**  I showed him beer farm basically and now he is the happiest farmer of the network because  
**[0:16:29-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:16:29):**  he was the first and now he is happy for two main reasons.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:16:37):**  The first one is that he has for the first time clients all around the country with no  
**[0:16:47-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:16:47):**  marketing costs, with no digital skills and he saw how people respect him just because  
**[0:16:56-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:16:56):**  he is a farmer and the second reason why he is happy is because he is receiving money.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:17:04):**  I mean he is receiving not just more money than the normal, the traditional supply chain,  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:17:12):**  he is receiving also advanced money because with beer farm I give to my father and the  
**[0:17:18-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:17:18):**  other farmers every three months the advanced payment of the fruit that they are on the  
**[0:17:26-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:17:26):**  tree so if he picked the fruit in November, in October he already has collected all the  
**[0:17:36-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:17:36):**  money about the fruit that he is going to sell online.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:17:39):**  Which is very, just to be clear, which is very different from what a normal supermarket  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:17:44):**  would do because if somebody would pick the oranges in November when would a normal supermarket  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:17:49):**  maybe pay this?  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:17:52):**  Well the first thing that I have to say that it is not the supermarket that pays because  
**[0:17:57-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:17:57):**  the farmer doesn't sell directly to the supermarket, there are a lot of middlemen in the middle  
**[0:18:05-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:18:05):**  that they collect fruit and ship to like other cities and other collective operatives so  
**[0:18:17-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:18:17):**  it's a long chain but the farmer normally receives the payment of the fruit in three  
**[0:18:26-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:18:26):**  steps.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:18:27):**  The first is around 10% in the beginning when he starts to pick the fruit and the second  
**[0:18:34-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:18:34):**  part of the payment that is around, it depends of course 30-40% in two-three months after  
**[0:18:44-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:18:44):**  he picked the fruit and then the rest, the last part of the money he receives in four,  
**[0:18:52-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:18:52):**  five, six months, it depends on a lot of things but for the farmers it is a dream to receive  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:19:00):**  the money before picking the fruit.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:19:03):**  And then of course you're paying more than the 25 or the 20 cents you would normally  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:19:08):**  get.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:19:09):**  90 cents, now I'm giving to my father 90 cents per kilo.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:19:15):**  And is that like this 20, 25 to 90 is that a normal ratio that you're also seeing at  
**[0:19:21-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:19:21):**  the other fruits, the other farmers you have on the platform now?  
**[0:19:25-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:19:25):**  Is that like the let's say three, four times as much?  
**[0:19:28-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:19:28):**  Yeah basically it depends, I saw that in the south it's more common to have like three  
**[0:19:36-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:19:36):**  times more payment with beer farm, in the north it depends from 50 to 70% more but it's  
**[0:19:46-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:19:46):**  always more basically.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:19:49):**  Which is key because that gets to a very important point.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:19:53):**  What do you see in farmers that want to take care of the land that have gone organic or  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:19:57):**  are in the process maybe have gone beyond organic and are looking at their soil even  
**[0:20:02-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:20:02):**  differently?  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:20:03):**  So if we would pay more like you're doing, if that would mean that they would do more  
**[0:20:08-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:20:08):**  for the land, is price one of the constraints they have now that holding them back to do  
**[0:20:15-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:20:15):**  more?  
**[0:20:16-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:20:16):**  Of course, well I have a question to you.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:20:21):**  If you would be a farmer and if you don't have money to let your family eat, do you  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:20:29):**  think first to your family or to your crops?  
**[0:20:33-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:20:33):**  It's obvious to your family but you see that with your farmers as well that because they  
**[0:20:41-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:20:41):**  are, you're still small obviously but because they are part of beer farm that they start  
**[0:20:48-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:20:48):**  to look at the future.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:20:49):**  Yes, they are starting to look at the future and all the farmers, the local farmers that  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:20:55):**  I met, they are something in common.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:21:00):**  They deeply love, they respect the land where they are.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:21:06):**  They understand that the land, the soil, the crops are their past, present and future of  
**[0:21:14-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:21:14):**  the family.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:21:18):**  So basically they want to respect and cultivate their crops in a natural way because there  
**[0:21:29-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:21:29):**  is a difference between the small local farmers and the huge multinational farming companies.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:21:37):**  The local farmer leaves the crops that he cultivate.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:21:45):**  The huge companies, they don't care about basically the crops because they don't live  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:21:51):**  there.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:21:52):**  It's a huge company and they think just about the profit.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:21:56):**  So the local farmer, if he has the opportunity to have a good income and to let the family  
**[0:22:06-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:22:06):**  be sustainable, he of course is going to improve the soil and the land because he knows that  
**[0:22:15-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:22:15):**  if he respects the soil, the soil will give back good fruit.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:22:25):**  The farmer wants to leave the crops to his sons, to his daughters.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:22:30):**  So basically if he respects the soil, the soil will be more fertile, more productive.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:22:39):**  So basically yes, if they have more money, the local farmer, they will invest in improving  
**[0:22:48-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:22:48):**  the soil moisture, the soil quality.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:22:52):**  Of course, I have no doubt about that.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:22:55):**  That makes it extremely interesting.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:22:58):**  And now for a small look into the future of Be Your Farm, you are offering I think three  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:23:05):**  to four or five different types of fruits, olive oil as well.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:23:09):**  What do you see in the medium to long term?  
**[0:23:14-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:23:14):**  What's your vision for Be Your Farm?  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:23:16):**  Yeah, basically now we are still a small startup.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:23:20):**  We have nine kinds of fruits and five farmers online and another one with the kiwi is coming.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:23:32):**  But basically what we want to do is to become a big shared farm.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:23:42):**  We want to connect people with local farmers in order to have a huge local farm where who  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:23:51):**  produce the food and who bring to the table are connected.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:23:57):**  And it doesn't care if you like oranges, zucchini or apple, you can grow everything you want  
**[0:24:04-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:24:04):**  in your shared farm.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:24:07):**  And you just say to the farmer, hey, I want to taste this, this, this.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:24:11):**  You follow the growing or everything you want, then you receive it.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:24:16):**  So this is what we want to do, a big shared farm.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:24:20):**  And you are at an interesting moment in Be Your Farm's history because you've been self-funded  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:24:27):**  so far and you've been an accelerator for a bit, the most famous in Italy.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:24:32):**  But now, like next week or when this is edited and online, there's going to be a very exciting  
**[0:24:36-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:24:36):**  new development.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:24:37):**  Can you share a bit more about that?  
**[0:24:40-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:24:40):**  Yeah, it will be the first time for us to try to become bigger and to go market with  
**[0:24:52-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:24:52):**  the real version of our product.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:24:55):**  And we want to do it with a crowdfunding campaign, an equity crowdfunding campaign.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:25:01):**  Because we think that all our users, all the people that we met in our way, all the people  
**[0:25:11-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:25:11):**  that love Be Your Farm, they can be part of Be Your Farm, not just like users, but like  
**[0:25:18-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:25:18):**  stakeholders.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:25:19):**  So we will launch this campaign in a few weeks.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:25:24):**  And we hope that people will love the same concept that we promote, so the sharing farming  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:25:35):**  in order to support local farmers and enjoy real fresh fruit.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:25:41):**  So finger crossed for us and we are working on it.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:25:46):**  And I want to thank you so much.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:25:47):**  And of course, I will keep my fingers crossed as well for your time, Osvaldo, in explaining  
**[0:25:52-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:25:52):**  the struggle of organic fruit farmers in Italy, but also in many other southern European countries  
**[0:25:59-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:25:59):**  and actually also northern European countries of that risk and of the price and of the unfair  
**[0:26:05-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:26:05):**  position they are in.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:26:07):**  And like you said, we are at a level where we have technology and hopefully a level of  
**[0:26:13-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:26:13):**  consciousness that we can start changing these systems.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:26:15):**  And it seems like an interesting first attempt to do just that.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:26:20):**  Thank you so much.

**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/#t=0:27:40):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money

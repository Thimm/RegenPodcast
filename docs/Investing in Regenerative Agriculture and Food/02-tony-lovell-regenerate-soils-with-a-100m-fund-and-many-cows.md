**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:00:13):**  You are going to listen to an interview with Tony Lovell, co-founder and CEO of SLM Partners.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:00:18):**  We discussed quite a bit in this interview ranging from the biology of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:00:23-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:00:23):**  to what's probably the biggest hidden cost in livestock operations, stress on animals.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:00:29):**  And we also discussed where does regenerative agriculture fit in your investment portfolio  
**[0:00:33-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:00:33):**  and where should smart investors, smart impact investors look at when they want to get involved?  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:00:39):**  What are the conditions they need to think of before they get involved in the regenerative  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:00:43):**  agriculture space?  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:00:47):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if  
**[0:00:52-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:00:52):**  the Planet Mattered.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:00:53):**  A podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:00:58):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:01:03):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:01:07):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:10-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:01:10):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:13-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:01:13):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:01:16):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:01:21):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:01:26):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:30-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:01:30):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:01:33):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further, share more interviews, there  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:01:37):**  are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:01:42):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:01:46):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.

**[0:02:03-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:02:03):**  And now, without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:02:06):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:02:07-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:02:07):**  So welcome to this podcast, I'm Koen van Zeyde, the host of today.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:02:10):**  Today in the podcast we have Tony Lovell, co-founder and CEO of Azalem Partners, an  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:02:15):**  asset manager that acquires and manages rural land on behalf of institutional investors  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:02:20):**  to scale up regenerative and ecological farming and forestry systems.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:02:25):**  Welcome Tony!  
**[0:02:26-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:02:26):**  Welcome, thank you very much.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:02:28):**  So to start right into the interesting part, why are you in this sector?  
**[0:02:34-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:02:34):**  Why are you doing this after a successful career in the corporate world?  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:02:41):**  There is probably nothing I would rather be doing with my life at the moment than this.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:02:46):**  I find it intellectually, emotionally, physically just challenging and rewarding on a whole  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:02:53):**  range of levels.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:02:57):**  The opportunity to combine the ecological, the social and the financial in a good balance  
**[0:03:02-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:03:02):**  to do it at scale, to activate institutional capital in genuinely regenerative and sustainable  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:03:09):**  agriculture, it's just a nice place to be.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:03:14):**  Yeah, I think also we're living in nice times to do that.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:03:18):**  But you started a number of years ago.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:03:21):**  Can you walk me through the steps you took and the steps in your mind you took to end  
**[0:03:26-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:03:26):**  up at livestock in Australia, what you're working on now and not for instance solar  
**[0:03:32-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:03:32):**  in South Africa?  
**[0:03:34-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:03:34):**  Okay, so a bit of background.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:03:37):**  There's been farming and agriculture in my family for several generations.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:03:44):**  My great grandparents were some of the early settlers in one of the areas in Queensland  
**[0:03:48-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:03:48):**  here in Australia.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:03:50):**  My father had grown up on a farm.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:03:53):**  We had some of my happiest memories.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:03:55):**  We spent some formative years as a teenager with a dairy farm, small family dairy farm,  
**[0:04:00-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:04:00):**  milking the cows in the morning, going to school, coming back and milking the cows in  
**[0:04:03-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:04:03):**  the afternoon.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:04:04):**  It was very enjoyable, a very nice lifestyle.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:04:07):**  For my sins, I ended up as a chartered accountant, as you said, and spent time in commerce and  
**[0:04:13-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:04:13):**  in business.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:04:14):**  But I've always had an interest in the land.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:04:18):**  The thing that was always sitting in the back of my mind was why farming seemed to be so  
**[0:04:24-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:04:24):**  tough all the time.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:04:25):**  I know there's seasonal conditions.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:04:26):**  I know there's difficult days with that.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:04:29):**  But it seemed that the land was degrading for reasons other than just climatic conditions.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:04:34):**  It just seems that something was being – we weren't doing something properly.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:04:38):**  There was something missing.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:04:41):**  Only 10, 15 years ago, I came across a book by Alan Savery, Holistic Management – Holistic  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:04:47):**  Decision Making – Holistic Management, sorry, A New Framework for Decision Making.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:04:52):**  When I read that book, it was fascinating.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:04:55):**  It was really interesting because it pretty much provided a very balanced view of things,  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:05:00):**  but it also answered ecologically everything that I'd seen happening on grazing lands  
**[0:05:06-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:05:06):**  in Australia.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:05:07):**  It explained to me as I was reading the book what was happening on the land, why it was  
**[0:05:11-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:05:11):**  happening.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:05:12):**  It also made it obvious that it didn't need to happen, and if we did things differently,  
**[0:05:16-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:05:16):**  we could fix it.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:05:17):**  That was a fascinating part of it.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:05:19):**  Ecologically, it made a lot of sense.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:05:21):**  The social aspect of it made sense.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:05:23):**  Then financially, what jumped out of it, it was just a very good way to run a business.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:05:28):**  The decision-making processes, the disciplines that were provided in that way of thinking  
**[0:05:34-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:05:34):**  wrapped together nicely and packaged it up.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:05:37):**  I met a friend, Bruce Ward, who was a Holistic Management educator.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:05:41):**  I spent some time with Bruce.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:05:44):**  What came out of it was I went to a conference in Armidale in New South Wales.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:05:50):**  Alan Savery was the keynote speaker.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:05:51):**  At the end of his keynote speech, he basically said, if you think this stuff is important,  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:05:56):**  if you think it matters, if you think somebody should do something about it, that somebody  
**[0:06:00-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:06:00):**  is you.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:06:01):**  Get up and do something.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:06:02):**  I thought, okay, that's fine.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:06:03):**  I started looking at how do we do it.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:06:09):**  What were the pieces that were missing?  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:06:11):**  What became obvious to me was that what was missing was the scale.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:06:16):**  A lot of people were doing it very successfully with their family farm and their small operation.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:06:21):**  They're not necessarily introspective and limited view, but a view that worked really  
**[0:06:26-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:06:26):**  well for them.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:06:28):**  It was addressing the issues that they had in their life on their family farm and their  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:06:32):**  succession and their children, etc.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:06:35):**  There was an opportunity to do it at scale.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:06:37):**  If we could connect institutional level capital, basically add zeros to the process.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:06:43):**  People who were doing 1,000 acres, if we could do 100,000 acres.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:06:46):**  People who are investing a million, if we could invest 100 million.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:06:49):**  There was an opportunity there to jump through and take it up a couple of orders of magnitude.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:06:56):**  That's what we started working on.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:06:58):**  The idea was to try to connect institutional capital with the opportunities on the land.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:07:06):**  We've had some degree of success with that.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:07:11):**  Can you walk us through a bit of the overview of what you're currently working on and have  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:07:15):**  been working on for the last few years in Australia?  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:07:19):**  How does that look like practically on the ground when you scale it up from working on  
**[0:07:24-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:07:24):**  your farm yourself with this approach to a number of properties and in a more fund-like  
**[0:07:30-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:07:30):**  structure?  
**[0:07:32-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:07:32):**  What we've got is basically in order for it to work at scale, you obviously need to have  
**[0:07:39-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:07:39):**  some...  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:07:40):**  If you're going to deploy $100 million, at the moment the SLMs fund is about $100 million  
**[0:07:44-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:07:44):**  fund.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:07:45):**  We've got about 1.4 million acres, so 480,000 hectares under management at the moment.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:07:51):**  There's about 700,000 acres, which is 280,000 hectares.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:07:56):**  It's fully developed with new water systems, new fencing infrastructure, new cattle yards,  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:08:01):**  five full-time managers and a crew of people and cattle being operated and cattle there  
**[0:08:07-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:08:07):**  being moved, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:08:08):**  The farms are fully functional now up and running.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:08:15):**  Where we start is we're looking at it and we're saying, okay, we want to deploy $100  
**[0:08:19-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:08:19):**  million.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:08:20):**  The basic theory is that we buy, I suppose, what we call the elements of easy.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:08:27):**  We're looking for a country that's easy to manage, that's easy to operate, that's easy  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:08:30):**  to put the infrastructure in, that's easy to get access to, that gives us opportunities  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:08:35):**  and choices in terms of where we can sell cattle to, where we can buy cattle from, how  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:08:40):**  we can manipulate the animals to make sure we have the right animals in the right place  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:08:45):**  at the right time for the reasons that make sense in the whole business package.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:08:50):**  It's a way of thinking about that.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:08:53):**  To get the scale, it means that we need to be, you can't put together 100,000 acres,  
**[0:08:58-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:08:58):**  40,000 hectares outside of a capital city.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:09:00):**  We have to be several hundred or 800 or 900 kilometers away from capital cities to get  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:09:07):**  the scale of land we're looking about.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:09:11):**  When we look at that country, what we've got is an inherently good quality country that  
**[0:09:15-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:09:15):**  has been inappropriately managed.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:09:16):**  Now, I'm not saying it's been wrongly managed.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:09:18):**  It's been managed inappropriately.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:09:20):**  People have managed with best intentions in most cases.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:09:24):**  What they haven't had is the knowledge and the insight as to how the ecosystem functions,  
**[0:09:29-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:09:29):**  how grasses and grazing animals co-evolved, and what is meant to happen in nature and  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:09:38):**  what if you don't do really has some very negative effects on it.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:09:43):**  A lot of this land has been degraded through inappropriate management as much as bad seasonal  
**[0:09:48-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:09:48):**  conditions.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:09:49):**  A lot of this land, because people haven't had a lot of money and also things like plastic  
**[0:09:56-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:09:56):**  pipes for distributing water.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:09:58):**  If you go back 50 years, you didn't have that sort of technology.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:10:01):**  You didn't have the infrastructure, the way to put infrastructure in.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:10:05):**  You had horse and cart versus bulldozers.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:10:08):**  You couldn't do the same sorts of physical amount of work and physical amount of moving  
**[0:10:13-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:10:13):**  to put the infrastructure in.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:10:14):**  So there's reasons they didn't have things.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:10:17):**  We take those properties and we look at them and say, okay, here's a good water resource  
**[0:10:22-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:10:22):**  distributed inappropriately.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:10:24):**  We could do something with that.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:10:25):**  Here's some paddock sizes.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:10:26):**  They're a bit inappropriate.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:10:28):**  They're too big, too small, whatever they are.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:10:31):**  We then change things.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:10:33):**  So we take a chunk of country, 100,000 acres.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:10:35):**  We put a good water system in there.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:10:37):**  We put a different way of setting out the fencing.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:10:39):**  We get it set up so that we have control over our animals and control over when they're  
**[0:10:44-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:10:44):**  in paddocks, when they're resting in the paddock, when they come back into the paddock, all  
**[0:10:49-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:10:49):**  those sorts of factors.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:10:51):**  That's basically what the process is.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:10:54):**  The fundamental thesis of it is that we buy a chunk of land that's inherently good quality  
**[0:10:59-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:10:59):**  land.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:11:00):**  It's been degraded.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:11:02):**  It's operating below its inherent potential due to inappropriate management and a lack  
**[0:11:09-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:11:09):**  of appropriate infrastructure.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:11:10):**  We put the infrastructure in.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:11:12):**  We change the management to what we believe is appropriate management.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:11:15):**  Over the life of the fund, we basically double the long-term carrying capacity.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:11:20):**  We effectively run twice as many animals as you normally would.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:11:24):**  We halve the cost of production.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:11:25):**  If you're running twice as many animals at half the cost of production, you drop out  
**[0:11:30-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:11:30):**  a reasonable return to investors.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:11:32):**  That's the really broad brush and simple view of what we're doing.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:11:37):**  That's an enormous difference.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:11:38):**  I can imagine on how the land looked before and how the land was performing before.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:11:44):**  You also worked as an advisor for farmers before.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:11:49):**  Did you notice, because of course, 100 years ago or 50 or 60 years ago, this technology  
**[0:11:53-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:11:53):**  wasn't there and this knowledge probably of how grass interacts with livestock wasn't  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:11:57):**  there, but then 15 or 20 years ago, it started to emerge.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:12:01):**  Savory has been working on this for quite a bit.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:12:04):**  How is it that not all farmers or 70% of the farmers are using this?  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:12:10):**  Is there something that holds them back against new technologies or new ways of looking at  
**[0:12:15-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:12:15):**  it?  
**[0:12:16-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:12:16):**  I personally wasn't advising farmers.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:12:19):**  Bruce was doing that consistently.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:12:21):**  I had a lot of time in vehicles annoying Bruce, asking him a lot of questions.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:12:25):**  One of the questions I consistently asked was exactly the one that you just asked.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:12:28):**  This stuff is so obvious.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:12:30):**  Why doesn't everybody do it?  
**[0:12:31-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:12:31):**  You'll see, for example, some of the fence line photographs.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:12:34):**  I've been at fence lines between somebody operating, managing their country the way  
**[0:12:39-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:12:39):**  that we're talking about, and the neighbor not managing it.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:12:42):**  We're doing it ourselves with SLM.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:12:43):**  We've got direct comparisons with the neighbors.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:12:48):**  It's pretty obvious that there's a difference there.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:12:50):**  It's striking, yeah.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:12:52):**  The question then becomes, why don't they change?  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:12:54):**  One of the most consistent things that I've found with every farmer I've ever met is that  
**[0:12:59-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:12:59):**  they're all human beings.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:13:02):**  Human beings are not necessarily the most rational creatures on the planet.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:13:06):**  We work on emotions.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:13:07):**  We work on post-decision rationalization, and we find reasons that things are different.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:13:14):**  You've got to remember, in a lot of these cases, you've got a farming community.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:13:18):**  You've got people who've grown up with the people who are their third or fourth generation,  
**[0:13:23-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:13:23):**  their father and grandfather.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:13:25):**  The land is probably still in the grandfather's name.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:13:27):**  The father lives on the property.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:13:29):**  They're then trying to work the thing.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:13:31):**  They haven't sorted out succession issues yet.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:13:36):**  They're working on the land, but they don't own the land.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:13:38):**  They want to change anything.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:13:40):**  They don't really have the right to make the decisions yet.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:13:43):**  There's a lot of frustration that gets built up there.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:13:47):**  What they're doing is what their father and grandfather did.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:13:50):**  What they're doing is what all their friends and neighbors and everyone they know is managing  
**[0:13:54-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:13:54):**  the way they're managing.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:13:55):**  While they might look over the fence to see one neighbor who's doing things a little bit  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:14:00):**  differently, and his property looks different, you've got to remember that they have other  
**[0:14:04-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:14:04):**  neighbors.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:14:05):**  When they look at the other neighbors, their other neighbors look like they do.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:14:11):**  What they're seeing most of the time is everything looking like what they're doing because everyone's  
**[0:14:15-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:14:15):**  doing what they're doing.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:14:18):**  For them to make a change, what they've got to do at some level is acknowledge that what  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:14:24):**  they have been doing hasn't been working, and it's been, to use a term, wrong.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:14:29):**  For anyone to acknowledge to themselves that what they've been doing is wrong is a fairly  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:14:34):**  big step.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:14:38):**  What they've been doing is what their father and grandfather did, what their friends and  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:14:42):**  neighbors and uncles and everyone they know is doing that.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:14:45):**  They're basically saying that everyone they know is doing it wrong.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:14:50):**  In a small community, in any sort of community, that's a big step to take.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:14:55):**  As a result, most people who actually do this make the change out of desperation.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:15:01):**  It's almost the last throw of the dice.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:15:04):**  They're about to lose things, they find this, and they have to do something different.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:15:09):**  Families have broken up over this.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:15:10):**  There have been big disputes over this.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:15:11):**  There's been a lot of stuff because it does call into question what we've been doing for  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:15:17):**  the last 50 years.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:15:20):**  That's where the social part of it becomes really tricky.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:15:22):**  That's where, in my thinking, the opportunity was, from a fun point of view, we can come  
**[0:15:28-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:15:28):**  in and do something.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:15:30):**  I don't consider ourselves to be a corporate operation in the sense of a corporate man  
**[0:15:34-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:15:34):**  or a corporate business.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:15:36):**  I think we're a very commercial business, but we don't want to bring that corporate  
**[0:15:40-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:15:40):** ... There's some negative aspects of the corporate culture, so I don't want to bring that across.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:15:43):**  I want to bring a very embarrassingly simple, to use a Bill Mollison term, embarrassingly  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:15:49):**  simple structure to it and a discipline.  
**[0:15:53-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:15:53):**  We can come in as outsiders and we can do some things that somebody who's bolted into  
**[0:16:00-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:16:00):**  the community couldn't do.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:16:01):**  We can have our managers do things on our behalf that they couldn't do, probably they  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:16:06):**  would struggle to do if they were owning their own properties.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:16:10):**  As an outsider, you can get away with it.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:16:14):**  We can't, yeah.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:16:15):**  As an outsider, we can do that.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:16:16):**  I think that's the big thing that people don't allow for in this in terms of... I've had  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:16:21):**  people look at the presentation you've given, photos, and they go, can't this guy see what's  
**[0:16:26-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:16:26):**  happening next door?  
**[0:16:27-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:16:27):**  Why doesn't he change?  
**[0:16:28-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:16:28):**  It completely leaves out the incredible... The price we pay as human beings for being in  
**[0:16:35-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:16:35):**  a social structure.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:16:36):**  We have to get on with our friends and neighbors.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:16:38):**  We have to go to the pub after football on a Friday or after the kids' school function  
**[0:16:43-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:16:43):**  or the swimming carnival or whatever.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:16:46):**  We have to interact with these people all the time.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:16:47):**  We have to be very careful how far you push that and how far we expect other people to  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:16:53):**  push when we wouldn't do it ourselves.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:16:57):**  Because otherwise you'll be the crazy one and basically being pushed out of all the  
**[0:17:02-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:17:02):**  social life in the village or in the community in general.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:17:05):**  Village is a very good term for it because we are whatever the size of it is, even where  
**[0:17:11-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:17:11):**  you are in Florence or in Rome or in London, you're in the whole thing.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:17:15):**  Part of the breakdown is that if it's working in London, for example, your pub is your village.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:17:22):**  That's breaking down a bit, but that's where the village interaction was.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:17:25):**  There's lots of little villages and that's who we interact with.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:17:29):**  You don't want to be considered the weird one or the crazy one.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:17:32):**  A few people do and they were probably the ones that were moving out of desperation or  
**[0:17:36-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:17:36):**  out of pure will to change things.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:17:42):**  Have you seen now that you're operating in some of these communities as an outsider that  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:17:48):**  maybe others start to look differently at this approach because somebody else is validating  
**[0:17:53-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:17:53):**  it for them and they maybe can refer to that?  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:17:55):**  Is there some spillover effect there?  
**[0:17:59-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:17:59):**  I do think that's a very good point.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:18:02):**  You're right.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:18:04):**  If I look at the transition we've had over the last four years, and we started this fund  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:18:08):**  back in about 2012, we actually acquired our first properties and took control at the start  
**[0:18:14-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:18:14):**  of 2013.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:18:15):**  We're three to four years in communities.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:18:21):**  That transition has been interesting.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:18:22):**  The first year or two, it was SLM, sustainable land management.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:18:27):**  Well, SLM was stupid land management, silly land management.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:18:31):**  It was all these sorts of little things and there'd be a few niggly little comments made  
**[0:18:38-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:18:38):**  in passing, et cetera.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:18:39):**  This isn't going to work.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:18:40):**  It's not going to work here.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:18:42):**  What we found out really, really quickly, it's amazing the number of people who have  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:18:46):**  absolutely no idea what it is that we're doing actually.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:18:50):**  They don't understand what the grazing process is and what the logic and the science behind  
**[0:18:56-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:18:56):**  it.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:18:57):**  They don't know about that, but they know one clear fact that it won't work here.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:19:02):**  They were adamant it wouldn't work for reasons they weren't sure, but they just knew it wouldn't.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:19:06):**  That was the social part of it.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:19:07):**  Because here it's different.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:19:08):**  Yeah, it's different here.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:19:09):**  It's too wet, it's too dry, too hot, too cold, through this, through that.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:19:14):**  This stuff works anywhere grass grows.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:19:15):**  This gives you a fairly big chunk of the planet that it works on.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:19:19):**  It works differently, but the same because you're still interacting with animals and  
**[0:19:24-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:19:24):**  grazing the whole package.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:19:26):**  Interestingly over the period of time, we probably had the transition starting to happen  
**[0:19:31-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:19:31):**  where we've got neighbors interested in what we're doing, but neighbors asking questions  
**[0:19:33-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:19:33):**  about it.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:19:34):**  One of the neighbors flew over our country probably eight months ago when things were  
**[0:19:39-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:19:39):**  really dry.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:19:40):**  He said that he knows when he flew over SLN country because it wasn't shiny.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:19:45):**  Everything else he was flying over was shiny.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:19:46):**  We had ground cover.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:19:47):**  We had something even in the middle of the drought.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:19:49):**  We had enough that it was visible from the air that our country wasn't shining off as  
**[0:19:55-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:19:55):**  much as the other neighbors were.  
**[0:19:57-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:19:57):**  He's been positive about it.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:19:59):**  They actually had some of their cattle running on our country because they'd run short of  
**[0:20:04-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:20:04):**  feed.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:20:05):**  We had some feed.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:20:06):**  He was very impressed with how the cattle came back.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:20:09):**  They were much quieter after being managed the way we manage these low stress stock handling.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:20:14):**  The cattle were mothering up better with their calves.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:20:18):**  The conditions they put on while they're on the property.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:20:21):**  He's always been supportive or open to the ideas, but he was just blown away with watching  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:20:27):**  his own animals and seeing the difference it could make to them.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:20:32):**  We're getting good reports from sale yards where the cattle come through.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:20:36):**  One of the major sale yards in Queensland, they were the quietest cattle I've had through  
**[0:20:40-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:20:40):**  there in the whole year.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:20:42):**  They're putting through 5,000 or 10,000 animals a week.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:20:47):**  Those sorts of things, you start to build a reputation.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:20:50):**  You're in the community.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:20:52):**  We've been to the local country race meeting three years in a row.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:20:58):**  We're not too headed and we're not chanting some sort of mantra.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:21:02):**  We're obviously not part of some bizarre cult.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:21:05):**  We're just running cows and we're doing it a little bit differently to what other people  
**[0:21:08-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:21:08):**  are doing.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:21:11):**  It might be working.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:21:13):**  I think those sorts of things, it'll be a slow, steady process, but people mightn't  
**[0:21:19-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:21:19):**  do quite as intensively as we are, but they'll start to change a little bit.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:21:22):**  It gives them permission, I think, is an important part.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:21:26):**  When you look at the last year, so if you look a year back, so basically it's November  
**[0:21:31-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:21:31):**  now and November 2015 until now, what has been the biggest change and shift you've seen  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:21:38):**  in the operations and in the company?  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:21:42):**  The biggest shift was that in November 2015, we were probably in the third year of a very  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:21:47):**  severe drought.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:21:52):**  The first three years in terms of character building, we had three of the four driest  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:21:57):**  years in the last 120 were the first three years of operating the farm.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:22:01):**  We ran straight into the teeth of a blazing drought.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:22:05):**  Talking about timing.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:22:06):**  Yeah, it was interesting.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:22:07):**  It made us better people.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:22:08):**  We're all better people.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:22:09):**  The country that we've got is on the bottom of the Warragga River, which is a river system  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:22:15):**  in Queensland.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:22:19):**  It's what they call a salad bowl.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:22:23):**  If there's rain in some ranges, 600 kilometers north of us, that can run down through the  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:22:31):**  river system and then we get a big, very gentle and beneficial flood across our country.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:22:36):**  The Warragga River, the first three years, it didn't run and that was the longest period  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:22:41):**  in records that there was no water flowing down the river.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:22:45):**  So not only didn't we get rainfall, we also didn't get this beneficial flooding.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:22:49):**  So we lost both things and that was pretty much unheard of in recorded European settlement  
**[0:22:56-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:22:56):**  of Australia.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:22:57):**  Obviously, it would have happened in the previous 40, 50 years.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:23:03):**  So we got to a point where we had completely destocked the properties, which is almost  
**[0:23:08-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:23:08):**  unheard of.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:23:09):**  So we had 700,000 acres with 30 cattle on them.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:23:13):**  Now that was a fairly dramatic move, but it was without doubt the best thing we did because  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:23:18):**  it allowed us time to, rather than having staff out there drought feeding and trying  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:23:23):**  to push animals, et cetera, which is what most people would do, what the conventional  
**[0:23:28-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:23:28):**  approach is, we completely destocked, sold all the animals off.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:23:31):**  That gave the team time to recover and sort out some internal issues there.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:23:35):**  That gave the land time to recover and gave it the opportunity to not be shiny, to use  
**[0:23:43-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:23:43):**  the neighbour's term.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:23:44):**  So we had some biological activity.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:23:47):**  We had some life in the soil.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:23:49):**  Now we then in June got the first lot of rain, the decent rain that we'd had for probably  
**[0:23:56-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:23:56):**  18 months to two years.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:23:58):**  In September, we got another backup lot of rain.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:24:00):**  So those two amounts of rain were the first time in the four years that in a 12 month  
**[0:24:06-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:24:06):**  period we'd had our average rainfall.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:24:10):**  Over the four year period, we're still a year and a half short of rain.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:24:12):**  But it was the first time.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:24:13):**  So we're still in a deep hole to fill up the soil moisture profile and to regenerate the  
**[0:24:20-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:24:20):**  ecosystem.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:24:21):**  That's just part of the environment in which we operate.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:24:25):**  Averages are a long term thing.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:24:26):**  You have the low average, a long period of time and you have a couple of good years.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:24:31):**  So we also then got some flooding through and we probably got between 40 and 50,000  
**[0:24:36-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:24:36):**  acres at 20,000 hectares that got beneficial flooding.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:24:40):**  So that's just an incredible difference.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:24:43):**  And to see the diversity, to see the speed with which the country responded to that beneficial  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:24:51):**  flooding and how the water, just the myriad places the water distributed itself into just  
**[0:24:57-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:24:57):**  nature in action was absolutely amazing to watch.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:25:00):**  And we started restocking.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:25:01):**  So where we are now, we're from zero cattle, we're at about 3,000 animals again.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:25:06):**  We'll be building up to about 10,000 to 12,000 head on the properties in the next three months.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:25:10):**  We've got animals that are being moved in a very consistent low stress way that they're  
**[0:25:17-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:25:17):**  performing well, they're gaining well.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:25:19):**  They're leaving country in a better condition as they graze it than it was before they went  
**[0:25:23-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:25:23):**  into it.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:25:24):**  So yeah, just the energy in the business slot is good.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:25:28):**  It was a hiatus between that really dry period and there's a good bit of rain.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:25:35):**  And you can see the benefit of what we did.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:25:37):**  You can see the benefit of even those first couple of tough years, not having pushed the  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:25:42):**  country too hard.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:25:43):**  Just those little aspects are starting to tie together.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:25:47):**  And this is the, I'm still confident that over the 10 years life of the fund, we will  
**[0:25:53-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:25:53):**  achieve what we set out to achieve.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:25:55):**  It will just be, it'll be a slow start and there'll be one or two good jumps.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:26:00):**  And when you look at the land of the neighbors, how did that respond differently to the events  
**[0:26:09-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:26:09):**  of the last year?  
**[0:26:10-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:26:10):**  So basically June and September, are there big differences and what are they?  
**[0:26:16-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:26:16):**  It's I think that the differences are that our land probably responded more rapidly and  
**[0:26:24-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:26:24):**  probably held on a little bit longer.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:26:27):**  So the principle is that if you, okay, so in a sort of situation we've got it, that  
**[0:26:33-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:26:33):**  the listeners, that the idea in a seasonally dry or intermittent rainfall area, what you'll  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:26:38):**  have is let's say it's a drought and things are really tough and things are dry and you've  
**[0:26:42-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:26:42):**  got a small number of sheep, for example, it might have 200 sheep in a 3000 acre paddock,  
**[0:26:49-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:26:49):**  a pasture.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:26:50):**  So there's not very many animals in there and it's got a lot of country and these sheep  
**[0:26:53-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:26:53):**  are just spending their time and every day they're looking for the best thing they can  
**[0:26:57-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:26:57):**  find to eat.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:26:58):**  That's the only thing they want to do is find the best thing they can eat.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:27:01):**  Now if it's been dry for seven or eight months, obviously there's not too many best things  
**[0:27:06-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:27:06):**  left there.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:27:07):**  They're picking at the basics.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:27:08):**  They're just, they're eking out an existence and they're just surviving.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:27:12):**  Now a rain event comes through.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:27:14):**  So we get three good days of rain and the soil is nice and moist and little plants start  
**[0:27:19-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:27:19):**  to poke their heads up.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:27:21):**  Well when those little tiny plants poke their heads up, they're soft and they're tender  
**[0:27:25-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:27:25):**  and they're very vulnerable and the sheep will go through and they will have a great  
**[0:27:28-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:27:28):**  time picking those out.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:27:30):**  But having picked those little plants out, those little plants have used up their energy  
**[0:27:36-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:27:36):**  in the seed to try to get out of the ground.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:27:38):**  They get their head nipped off.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:27:40):**  Those sheep go off and nip something else and they'll come back three or four days later  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:27:43):**  because that little plant tries to grow again and it's just grown some beautiful, soft,  
**[0:27:48-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:27:48):**  luscious, you know.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:27:49):**  It's only a small mouthful but it's a nice little mouthful and the sheep will come back  
**[0:27:52-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:27:52):**  and take it out again.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:27:54):**  And what you end up with is the animals selectively grazing out of the ecosystem, any palatable,  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:28:00):**  productive and nutritious plants, they selectively pick the best of them and they graze them  
**[0:28:05-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:28:05):**  pretty much out of the ecosystem.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:28:08):**  And what they're left with then is the thorny, spiky, toxic, nasty plants because they're  
**[0:28:14-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:28:14):**  the ones they don't like to eat.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:28:16):**  So you start to end up, every time you get a bit of a seasonal break, the country almost  
**[0:28:21-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:28:21):**  goes back a bit rather than going forward.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:28:24):**  And you can see that in the long-term records where about every generation there's a 20  
**[0:28:29-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:28:29):**  to 50% drop in carrying capacity.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:28:31):**  The next generation there's another drop.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:28:34):**  With our process what we do is we go in and when those, instead of those, you know, a  
**[0:28:41-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:28:41):**  couple of hundred sheep being in 3,000 acres, we'll have 2,000 cattle in 500 acres but they'll  
**[0:28:47-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:28:47):**  only be there for a day or two and then they'll move to the next one.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:28:49):**  So we have a lot more animals in a smaller area for a shorter period of time.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:28:54):**  The important thing is while they're in that pasture, they're not anywhere else.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:28:59):**  So if they're in pasture number one, then out of say 50 pastures and they're there for  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:29:06):**  two days, it'll take a hundred days before they come back.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:29:10):**  Now during that hundred days, that little grass, that little palatable plant that stuck  
**[0:29:13-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:29:13):**  its head up gets a chance to grow off of it.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:29:16):**  It gets a chance to put down roots.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:29:18):**  It gets a chance to establish itself, to build up some body and some capacity to handle  
**[0:29:23-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:29:23):**  when it does get grazed.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:29:25):**  And then when it starts to regrow, the animals are out of the paddock.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:29:28):**  So you totally change the way that you respond to a good seasonal event, a good rainfall  
**[0:29:34-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:29:34):**  event.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:29:35):**  And that's probably the noticeable part of it that on our country, you can see we have  
**[0:29:41-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:29:41):**  more in terms of quantity and more in terms of variety of plants than the direct neighbours  
**[0:29:51-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:29:51):**  on a consistent basis.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:29:53):**  And that's our first good rain event.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:29:54):**  So this will build and the next time we'll then build again because while the plants  
**[0:29:59-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:29:59):**  are green above ground, there's a lot of things happening below ground.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:30:01):**  That's the important part is what's happening below ground because that builds your resilience,  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:30:06):**  that improves your capacity for water to infiltrate, that changes the soil structure, that builds  
**[0:30:10-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:30:10):**  microbes and bacteria and fungi, all the things to build a really healthy village around every  
**[0:30:16-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:30:16):**  grass plant.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:30:17):**  And that's the sort of stuff we're looking at.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:30:21):**  Extremely, extremely interesting.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:30:23):**  So you're obviously hoping for a few good years to come in terms of rain.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:30:28):**  When you look at the operation one year from now, what do you think would be different  
**[0:30:33-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:30:33):**  when you're basically in year four slash five of the operation?  
**[0:30:38-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:30:38):**  What would be the main difference if we look back a year from now?  
**[0:30:46-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:30:46):**  I think the big thing will be this will be our first year of actually just operations  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:30:52):**  without any infrastructure development.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:30:54):**  So we've got all our fancy and all our infrastructure done.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:30:56):**  We've moved from a development phase into a straight operational phase.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:31:03):**  It's a little hard to say.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:31:04):**  It does depend on the seasonal conditions.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:31:06):**  So for the fund to work over the 10 years, we need probably three average years.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:31:12):**  It's just that in the country that we're in, it might take a decade to get three average  
**[0:31:15-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:31:15):**  years.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:31:17):**  If we get two or three good years, it'll really kick things.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:31:20):**  If you can put two years in a row, you really get a change.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:31:26):**  I think the big thing will happen is that, and the thing that I'm really looking forward  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:31:29):**  to is this, the 40 or 50,000 acres or 20,000 hectares of this beneficial flooding country.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:31:35):**  I'll send you a couple of photos of it.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:31:38):**  It's amazing to see how this country, for example, probably in imperial measurements,  
**[0:31:45-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:31:45):**  for every mile, it drops about a foot in elevation.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:31:49):**  It's almost tabletop flat.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:31:50):**  So when you do get a flood, it just dissipates in amazing directions.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:31:54):**  Little fingers of water roll out everywhere.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:31:57):**  What has happened for the last 150 years is animals have always been in there.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:32:04):**  So when it started to flood, the animals pushed out from that country and they've gone onto  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:32:09):**  the higher country, which might only be a half a meter or a meter out of the water.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:32:14):**  As the flood waters recede, they've worked their way through and they've picked all the  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:32:17):**  plants on the way in until they've got in the middle.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:32:21):**  And so you ended up with some plants being chewed out and some plants being along the  
**[0:32:25-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:32:25):**  rain.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:32:26):**  This will be the first time in a lot of this country that it's been our style of management  
**[0:32:30-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:32:30):**  where we've put a big number of animals into an area, we've had that impact, and then we've  
**[0:32:34-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:32:34):**  given it time to recover.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:32:36):**  So the fascinating bit to see will be if we get a graze out of this pasture now and we  
**[0:32:42-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:32:42):**  haven't had rain, but we've got good subsoil moisture, do we get a good recovery in the  
**[0:32:46-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:32:46):**  grasslands?  
**[0:32:47-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:32:47):**  Can we come back and get a second graze out of the flood that we had six months ago?  
**[0:32:53-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:32:53):**  It'd be fascinating if in 12 months time we're having a conversation and I'm saying to you  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:32:58):**  that we've got cattle grazing still through some of this flood country on the benefit  
**[0:33:03-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:33:03):**  of a flood that happened 12 months earlier.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:33:07):**  That would be absolutely amazing because it means we've changed the care system in a very  
**[0:33:11-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:33:11):**  positive way.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:33:12):**  That'd be the highlight.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:33:13):**  That's what I'll be looking forward to.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:33:17):**  We're going to check definitely in 12 months if that happens.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:33:22):**  What's on your mind for the next few months?  
**[0:33:25-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:33:25):**  What's the main thing that while you're switching from this really building up the infrastructure  
**[0:33:31-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:33:31):**  to more an operational phase of the fund, what's the main thing that keeps you awake  
**[0:33:37-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:33:37):**  at night?  
**[0:33:38-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:33:38):**  Probably the main thing that keeps me awake at night is the opportunities.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:33:44):**  I'm not being kept awake at night worrying about seasonal conditions and it being tough  
**[0:33:48-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:33:48):**  etc.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:33:49):**  I did an app with that probably three years ago, two years ago.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:33:54):**  The exciting part of it is looking at the opportunities.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:33:59):**  Where I'd like to be over the next three to six months is from the business point of view,  
**[0:34:04-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:34:04):**  the business running well.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:34:05):**  We've got a couple of new managers in there.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:34:08):**  We've just had the whole crew have gone through a low-stress stock handling course and they've  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:34:13):**  all had some really interesting insights in that.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:34:18):**  Stress on animals is the biggest hidden cost in any agriculture involving animals.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:34:23):**  That's the antibiotics and all those things that come into it.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:34:26):**  Even if you take out the confinement operations and the stress that's in that, handling livestock,  
**[0:34:32-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:34:32):**  handling any living creature, the stress can come into it.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:34:35):**  We can do a huge number of things to either put stress onto animals or take stress off.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:34:41):**  If we take the stress off the animals, not no stress at all but appropriate stress when  
**[0:34:46-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:34:46):**  needed and release that stress is the important part.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:34:49):**  They can handle a lot of stress as long as they know it releases.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:34:52):**  We can have some really tough days that work as long as we can have the weekend off.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:34:56):**  We can't handle a constant steady drip of either tedium or too much stress.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:35:03):**  That part of it, the difference in animal performance, the difference in weight gain,  
**[0:35:08-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:35:08):**  the difference in pregnancy rate, the difference in weaning rates that come from removing stress  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:35:14):**  off animals is phenomenal.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:35:18):**  That's an exciting thing to see that happen and see the whole team start to understand  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:35:22):**  that and how they can connect to the animals and how responsive animals are to us and how  
**[0:35:27-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:35:27):**  we need to be very responsive to them.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:35:29):**  If over the next three to six months I see that happening, I see the whole crew coming  
**[0:35:35-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:35:35):**  together on that really tightly.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:35:38):**  We get to a stage where we're getting feedback from people who are buying our cattle, glowing  
**[0:35:44-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:35:44):**  endorsements of the calmness of the animals, the way they perform so well for them, how  
**[0:35:49-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:35:49):**  they move.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:35:50):**  If they've gone into a breeding operation, they were some of the best breeders they've  
**[0:35:55-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:35:55):**  ever had.  
**[0:35:56-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:35:56):**  The cattle handled really smoothly.  
**[0:35:58-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:35:58):**  Those sorts of factors.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:35:59):**  We're doing some more monitoring on the biological side of things.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:36:03):**  The external consultant comes and does that.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:36:05):**  She'll be out again towards the end of the month and she'll assess the whole property  
**[0:36:10-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:36:10):**  and see what we've done over that period of time.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:36:12):**  We get some solid reports on that.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:36:14):**  We've had participation in the Australian government's carbon emissions reduction fund.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:36:20):**  From a biological point of view, we're growing carbon, we're storing carbon, we're being  
**[0:36:26-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:36:26):**  rewarded for that.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:36:27):**  If we go forward three to six months, we've got a business that from an investor point  
**[0:36:33-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:36:33):**  of view and from an investable point of view is maybe a little bit behind in terms of the  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:36:41):**  bottom line because of the seasonal conditions but has ticked a lot of other boxes.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:36:46):**  Anne will be in a position to go back to a lot of people and say, look, this is the story,  
**[0:36:50-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:36:50):**  this is what's happened, this is what you're seeing on the ground.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:36:53):**  Anne looked to raise another lot of capital and to go into the market and start to put  
**[0:36:58-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:36:58):**  more country back on the path to positive regeneration and general recovery.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:37:08):**  It's going to be an important and very interesting three to six months.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:37:13):**  When you look at regenerative agriculture from an investment point of view, you referred  
**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:37:17):**  to that a couple of times, for impact investors or for investors in general, what do you think  
**[0:37:22-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:37:22):**  are the two biggest barriers to scale up the regenerative agriculture mode?  
**[0:37:28-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:37:28):**  You've talked to many investors, what do you see as one of the biggest barriers to scale  
**[0:37:33-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:37:33):**  up the sector?  
**[0:37:34-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:37:34):**  I think maybe one of the things that people need to understand is it's not spreadsheet  
**[0:37:42-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:37:42):**  agriculture.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:37:43):**  You're dealing with biological systems.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:37:45):**  In our particular area, not the cropping and not the tree crops and silver crops, just  
**[0:37:52-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:37:52):**  from a grazing point of view, the ecosystem that we're dealing with has got some swings  
**[0:37:57-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:37:57):**  and roundabouts.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:37:58):**  It is a program that takes time.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:38:00):**  They need to be understanding that.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:38:02):**  They need to understand the biology part of it.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:38:05):**  I think Bill Mollison, the guy who started permaculture, is saying, while the problems  
**[0:38:10-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:38:10):**  of our planet are increasingly complex, the solutions remain embarrassingly simple.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:38:16):**  There are some simple things that we can do differently to get a good result, but we're  
**[0:38:20-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:38:20):**  dealing with a complex process.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:38:24):**  If you're in agriculture, you're dealing with living creatures.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:38:29):**  You're dealing with whether it's a chicken farm or it's a row crop or it's a prawn farm  
**[0:38:35-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:38:35):**  in Thailand or it's cattle farming in Australia.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:38:37):**  You are dealing with biology and living organisms.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:38:41):**  It's not a chemical process or a physical process that does that.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:38:45):**  It's dealing with them.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:38:48):**  You don't need to be a tree-hugging, greeny, left-leaning liberal to appreciate the fact  
**[0:38:55-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:38:55):**  that your investment is built, its very foundation is biology.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:39:00):**  If you've got to get that right, I'm talking with one group, their main metric they look  
**[0:39:04-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:39:04):**  at is soil carbon.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:39:05):**  If they're building carbon, that's their asset.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:39:09):**  If they look at that, they've got that headspace sitting underneath it.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:39:12):**  That's a metric that works for them.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:39:14):**  As they build the carbon level in the soils and carbon in all their products, everything  
**[0:39:18-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:39:18):**  they sell is carbon-based.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:39:19):**  All the food products and all the wool and the meat and the vegetables, they're all carbon-based  
**[0:39:23-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:39:23):**  products.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:39:24):**  Rather than exporting that, if you can actually retain some, you're getting an asset that's  
**[0:39:28-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:39:28):**  actually building underneath you.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:39:30):**  That's building long-term resilience.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:39:33):**  I think that's one big part of it.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:39:36):**  A lot of big institutions, they can't assess regenerative agriculture because they don't  
**[0:39:42-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:39:42):**  understand what it is.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:39:44):**  They haven't got a group internally.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:39:46):**  They haven't got an allocation for agriculture, let alone regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:39:51):**  They are dealing with people who are, they might be brilliant analysts and great with  
**[0:39:56-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:39:56):**  a spreadsheet, but they haven't got that bigger picture of what they're really talking about  
**[0:40:01-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:40:01):**  and where regenerative agriculture fits into a portfolio.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:40:06):**  What are the benefits?  
**[0:40:07-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:40:07):**  What are the basic, the de-risking benefits and the reduction in volatility and the lack  
**[0:40:14-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:40:14):**  of connection?  
**[0:40:16-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:40:16):**  It's not connected to the movements in fossil fuel prices.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:40:22):**  There's a range of factors that come into play.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:40:24):**  It's probably talking to somebody who is ecologically aware as well as being financially aware and  
**[0:40:31-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:40:31):**  can understand both sides of it.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:40:34):**  Whether or not that person has made their way far enough up the corporate food chain  
**[0:40:38-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:40:38):**  in these big institutions to make a decision.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:40:43):**  Something like the Global Impact Investor Network, an impact investor who's dealing  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:40:48):**  with their own private wealth, they can make a decision around that.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:40:53):**  They can see how that fits in their portfolio.  
**[0:40:55-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:40:55):**  They can actually drive that a bit more.  
**[0:40:56-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:40:56):**  I think that's an opportunity.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:40:58):**  It's a little bit like you were saying, does SLM coming into a local area give permission  
**[0:41:06-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:41:06):**  for the other farmers to start to change what they're doing?  
**[0:41:09-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:41:09):**  Yes, I think it does.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:41:12):**  In the institutional space, in the investment space, do some members of TWIN, that group,  
**[0:41:20-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:41:20):**  do them making some investments in regenerative agriculture give permission to the bigger  
**[0:41:25-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:41:25):**  institutions to start looking at that space a little bit more?  
**[0:41:27-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:41:27):**  I think possibly that's the direction.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:41:30):**  That's the way to shift it.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:41:31):**  No, definitely.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:41:32):**  I mean, if one joins, then it gives permission for others at least to look at it seriously.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:41:39):**  Did you notice a big shift when you got the Danish pension fund on board with that?  
**[0:41:46-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:41:46):**  The number of people who, I just find it interesting that in a lot of movies and a lot of things  
**[0:41:52-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:41:52):**  like Wall Street and the Wolf of Wall Street and all this, people have this vision or this  
**[0:41:58-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:41:58):**  idea that people in these investment funds are dynamic, risk taking out, they're trying  
**[0:42:03-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:42:03):**  things, they're really on the edge, it's all the stress of down on the trading floor, etc.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:42:09):**  When you actually talk to them, they're incredibly risk averse and they want to follow what's  
**[0:42:14-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:42:14):**  up.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:42:15):**  They want to be with the model.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:42:17):**  They want to be doing what everyone else is doing.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:42:20):**  Find somebody who actually go into somewhere different is incredibly rare.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:42:25):**  The reason for that is a lot of times they go into somewhere incredibly different and  
**[0:42:28-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:42:28):**  it doesn't work.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:42:29):**  You can't do that too many times in a row and keep a job in a big institutional pension  
**[0:42:33-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:42:33):**  fund.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:42:34):**  It doesn't work.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:42:35):**  You need to be as safe as possible.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:42:36):**  I understand that and I respect that because they're dealing with other people's money.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:42:42):**  In terms of having a conversation with somebody, it's a great idea who else is investing.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:42:47):**  We had a number of people who said, we'll put some money in if you can find another  
**[0:42:50-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:42:50):**  two people to come in with it.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:42:53):**  You're always constantly chasing to get in.  
**[0:42:56-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:42:56):**  This will work if somebody else goes and somebody else goes.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:42:58):**  Then by the time you actually get somebody else lined up, they want something slightly  
**[0:43:02-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:43:02):**  different to the first group.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:43:03):**  That doesn't quite align.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:43:04):**  Then you got to find somebody else.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:43:08):**  I probably found there wouldn't have been three or four people really had the authority  
**[0:43:14-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:43:14):**  had been given delegated authority to actually go and invest in something different.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:43:22):**  It'll take a while to get that through.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:43:25):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:43:26):**  We're all animals as well.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:43:30):**  It's like livestock.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:43:31):**  If you're spending too much time outside the herd, you probably get eaten.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:43:36):**  You won't do it a second time because you can't.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:43:39):**  I understand.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:43:40):**  It takes incredible courage to defend something different in a corporate structure, in a big  
**[0:43:47-0:43:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:43:47):**  structure and to make the case, especially also the payback or the proof that you were  
**[0:43:53-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:43:53):**  right comes late and comes later and over a 10-year fund.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:43:57):**  A 10-year is pretty long and people won't be there anymore.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:44:01):**  It's not, look, I was right and tomorrow we can see that I was actually right.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:44:06):**  That's the tricky part of it.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:44:09):**  That's why you're going to say, why aren't they investing?  
**[0:44:11-0:44:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:44:11):**  We have this thing in Australia where some of the politicians every now and then will  
**[0:44:16-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:44:16):**  bash their fist on the thing and say, why aren't Australian superannuation funds investing  
**[0:44:20-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:44:20):**  in agriculture?  
**[0:44:21-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:44:21):**  You go, well, the Australian press is always negative about agriculture and it's always  
**[0:44:27-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:44:27):**  a problem and there's always a drought and there's always this and they've also been  
**[0:44:32-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:44:32):**  a lot of people have spent a lot of time educating Australians on the fact that we are a very  
**[0:44:37-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:44:37):**  small part of the global market.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:44:39):**  Therefore you should diversify your portfolio.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:44:41):**  Therefore you want to superfund this invested in international shares and international  
**[0:44:45-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:44:45):**  property.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:44:46):**  When you can't tell a story to people about you need to invest internationally and then  
**[0:44:50-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:44:50):**  get upset that they're not investing locally.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:44:53):**  You got to allow for that.  
**[0:44:56-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:44:56):**  There are some reasons that these things don't work and it's not where they're investing  
**[0:45:01-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:45:01):**  at the moment.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:45:02):**  And if you just to finish off because I also want to be cautious of time.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:45:07):**  If you have one or two pieces of advice to smart investors that want to start investing  
**[0:45:13-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:45:13):**  maybe their own money or maybe their institution's money into regenerative agriculture, what  
**[0:45:20-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:45:20):**  would be your main one or two pieces of advice?  
**[0:45:25-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:45:25):**  Get really clear as to why they're looking at agriculture.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:45:28):**  What role does agriculture play in their portfolio?  
**[0:45:32-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:45:32):**  They want to invest in agriculture for diversification.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:45:36):**  They want to invest in agriculture because it's real asset backed and therefore some  
**[0:45:40-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:45:40):**  sort of protection against inflation.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:45:43):**  What is it that they're investing in it for and is that investment thesis and that reason  
**[0:45:48-0:45:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:45:48):**  solid and stable enough for a decade or more?  
**[0:45:53-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:45:53):**  Is it something that the board and the investment committee have locked into and will give you  
**[0:45:58-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:45:58):**  a commitment to for a decade or longer?  
**[0:46:01-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:46:01):**  They need to have that.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:46:02):**  They need to know that they're coming into it for this reason.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:46:04):**  They have that very clearly enunciated and set out and to get a commitment that that  
**[0:46:09-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:46:09):**  reason is solid for the period of time it will take to do regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:46:15):**  The reason for that is that regenerative agriculture versus conventional agriculture compare and  
**[0:46:22-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:46:22):**  contrast somebody goes into an undeveloped part of the Brazilian Cerrados, puts a big  
**[0:46:28-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:46:28):**  John Deere tractor with a great big plough on the back and ploughs all this country up,  
**[0:46:33-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:46:33):**  pours a whole amount of fertiliser into it.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:46:34):**  You can make the country grow something.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:46:37):**  You can force something out of it fairly quickly.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:46:39):**  You can set up a feedlot.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:46:41):**  You can put dairy cows in a confinement.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:46:42):**  You can make them as a manufacturing process produce milk.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:46:47):**  To me, my way of thinking that's an extractive process you're extracting from the system  
**[0:46:52-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:46:52):**  and over the course of a decade, the thing you've invested in is less resilient and less  
**[0:46:59-0:47:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:46:59):**  sustainable than it was when you started.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:47:02):**  So you guess you've made a financial return.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:47:04):**  You've sucked it out of the thing, but what have you got left at the end of it?  
**[0:47:08-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:47:08):**  With regenerative agriculture, what we're doing is we are regenerating something inherent  
**[0:47:13-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:47:13):**  in that as we're starting with something that's below where it could be and that takes time  
**[0:47:17-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:47:17):**  to be built up.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:47:18):**  We're dealing with a biological process.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:47:20):**  If we want to disconnect it from the index and have it not be correlated with the rest  
**[0:47:26-0:47:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:47:26):**  of the market, then if we disconnect from fossil fuel inputs, which drives a lot of  
**[0:47:32-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:47:32):**  things, we disconnect from a lot of external inputs, we're dealing with something that's  
**[0:47:37-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:47:37):**  provided free of charge, which is sunlight and rainfall.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:47:40):**  We get the biology working.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:47:41):**  We get the system more resilient.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:47:43):**  We start to build up something so that over the course of a decade, we have a stronger  
**[0:47:47-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:47:47):**  asset at the end than when we started.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:47:50):**  So that whole process of regenerating, of building something, taking something that  
**[0:47:55-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:47:55):**  is less than it could be and wants to be and allowing it and developing it to build up  
**[0:48:01-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:48:01):**  to its full potential, that takes a certain amount of time.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:48:04):**  You need to have an investment horizon and a mindset that balances that.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:48:09):**  If the investment horizon and mindset doesn't build over that period of time the same way  
**[0:48:14-0:48:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:48:14):**  the underlying asset of the biology and the land that you're dealing with, it also builds  
**[0:48:21-0:48:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:48:21):**  then the two aren't going to tie together.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:48:24):**  I think that's great advice and a really nice way to end this interview.

**[0:51:02-0:51:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:51:02):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:51:08-0:51:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:51:08):**  that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with very different means.

**[0:51:17-0:51:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:51:17):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.

**[0:51:22-0:51:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:51:22):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:51:29-0:51:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:51:29):**  so you don't have to write along.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:51:31):**  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:51:36-0:51:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:51:36):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:51:41-0:51:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:51:41):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:51:46-0:51:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:51:46):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:51:47-0:51:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:51:47):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:51:52-0:51:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:51:52):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:51:56):**  We're gonna look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:52:01):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:52:02-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:52:02):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:52:04):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:52:06):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:52:10):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:52:12):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/#t=0:52:17):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:00:13):**  The success and health of our society starts in the pregnant belly.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:00:18):**  So why are we feeding children so badly and mothers as well?  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:00:22):**  The shocking reality of baby food, even in the premium organic house, over 90% of the  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:00:26):**  food you find is fruit puree, apple, pear and banana.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:00:30):**  Of course, organic, but still sugar nonetheless.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:00:33):**  And there's no scientific backing for that at all.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:00:35):**  The first foods of baby shouldn't be fruit at all, but should be vegetables.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:00:39):**  Things that are bitter, maybe a bit acidic.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:00:41):**  Of course, they might not love it immediately, but they need to be exposed to it, to learn  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:00:46):**  how to eat it later and to become the non picky eaters we all need and to become healthy.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:00:51):**  This is an episode where we dive deep into baby nutrition and the first thousand days  
**[0:00:56-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:00:56):**  and why the current baby food industry really, really needs a shakeup.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:01:02):**  This is the investing in regenerative agriculture and food podcast investing as if the planet  
**[0:01:10-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:01:10):**  mattered.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:01:11):**  Where we talk to the pioneers in regenerative food and agriculture space to learn more on  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:01:15):**  how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities and ecosystems  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:01:20):**  while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:01:24):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:01:26):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:01:30):**  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:01:34):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:01:38):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:02:09-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:02:09):**  Welcome to another episode today with Jacqueline Snau, the co-founder of pumpkin organics organics,  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:02:15):**  and we're going to dive deep into baby food and what's the role of nutrition there, science,  
**[0:02:21-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:02:21):**  a lot of folklore, I think, and why and how it's such a pivotal moment for many people  
**[0:02:28-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:02:28):**  in terms of food, in terms of nutrition, in terms of food choices as well.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:02:31):**  So I'm very, very happy to unpack that and a lot more today.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:02:35):**  Welcome Jacqueline.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:02:36):**  Thank you.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:02:37):**  It's such a great pleasure to be here.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:02:39):**  And to start with that personal question we always like to throw at people first.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:02:44):**  How did you end up working on and co-founding a baby food company?  
**[0:02:48-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:02:48):**  Yeah, I get this question all the time.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:02:51):**  People just assumed I have a baby or I had a baby and oh, I didn't like what was in the  
**[0:02:55-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:02:55):**  market.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:02:56):**  But that's not it at all.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:02:58):**  I think many people do that and then they don't start a baby food company.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:02):**  Otherwise we would have millions and millions of baby food companies.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:04):**  I mean, many people maybe sort of start a baby food company in the kitchen for a while  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:08):**  and then transition to two other things in a very small scale.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:12):**  In this case, there's a different story behind it.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:14):**  Yeah, so I've been in the food industry, the commercial food industry almost my entire  
**[0:03:19-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:19):**  professional life.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:21):**  And I was so excited.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:22):**  Sorry, but you're still in the commercial food industry.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:25):**  Yeah, true.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:26):**  It's interesting when people say that the intensive, I say, yeah, you can do intensive  
**[0:03:29-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:29):**  differently.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:30):**  I hope this is commercial.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:31):**  Otherwise we will be talking to a nonprofit, which is also fine, but that was not the intention.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:35):**  It's very interesting how we framed that.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:38):**  Okay.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:39):**  So the commercial food industry are these big guys that are driven by lobbyists and  
**[0:03:42-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:42):**  driven by Wall Street expectations that actually are not driven by purpose or fancy marketing  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:49):**  claims or that have gigantic research and consumer insight budgets that are actually  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:54):**  doing this with their own purpose and passion and funding.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:04:00):**  And also really, I've got almost all of my friends and family invested in pumpkin.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:04:05):**  So if I don't make this work, I'm going to have a very lonely Christmas dinner coming  
**[0:04:09-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:04:09):**  up.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:04:10):**  At least we have a lot of food.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:04:11):**  Yeah, true.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:04:12):**  At least we will have a lot of food.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:04:13):**  You know, the reality is I really entered the big food company with a vision that I  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:04:20):**  was going to change nutrition, that I was going to change and have an impact on the  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:04:24):**  way we grow food, the way we serve food, the way food integrates into family.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:04:30):**  And that's not how it works.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:04:32):**  I was so amazed.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:04:34):**  It works by what your manager, manager, manager, manager says from plans one to two years ago.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:04:41):**  It's driven by, like in the US where I started by lobbyists and Wall Street.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:04:47):**  We were incentivized by cutting out real aspects of nutrition because the customer didn't  
**[0:04:53-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:04:53):**  maybe value it so we could put something cheaper in or do it a more economical way.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:04:59):**  Do you have an example of that?  
**[0:05:00-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:05:00):**  Like just a shocking one or just the one or the first one that triggered like, whoa, we  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:05:07):**  switched this for this and just from a nutrition or taste perspective, it doesn't make any  
**[0:05:12-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:05:12):**  sense.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:05:13):**  I had a couple trigger moments in my few years of the story that made me say, okay, I'm in  
**[0:05:18-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:05:18):**  this, but I'm going to make massive change or I have to switch because it's against every  
**[0:05:21-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:05:21):**  fundamental value.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:05:23):**  And one was a very standard boxed meal product in the US where the middle class, it was,  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:05:29):**  it's a billion dollar brand and it had real cheese powder in it.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:05:33):**  One of the only real components of nutrition in it.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:05:37):**  And they did consumer testing and they realized that it was the taste of the cheese.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:05:41):**  It wasn't the nutrition of the cheese.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:05:43):**  So they took the real cheese out and put a synthetic flavoring in.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:05:46):**  So basically it was about shipping air in a box that had a-  
**[0:05:51-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:05:51):**  Worse than air.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:05:52):**  Yeah, worse than air.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:05:53):**  Okay.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:05:54):**  And this was, the person was put on a stage and celebrated at our annual meeting that  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:06:02):**  they truly understood consumer insight and they drove massive cost savings to the company,  
**[0:06:07-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:06:07):**  which were both true.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:06:09):**  Absolutely true.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:06:10):**  But I had a feeling in my stomach and more importantly, like my brain-  
**[0:06:15-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:06:15):**  Literally, yeah.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:06:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:06:17):**  Like this is not what science says.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:06:19):**  Science is so clear on how nutrition can work.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:06:23):**  And not only that, we see it with increasing lifestyle diseases, like the top health issues  
**[0:06:30-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:06:30):**  in almost every society in the world are man or people caused, we cause them.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:06:37):**  So you cannot tell me that this is not, that there's no connection to what the food industry  
**[0:06:42-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:06:42):**  offers.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:06:43):**  And that was the first trigger.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:06:45):**  So that's-  
**[0:06:46-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:06:46):**  And then why and how, I mean, I understand the why really well, but what was the trigger  
**[0:06:52-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:06:52):**  to start focusing on that first 1000 days or that the first baby said, because you clearly  
**[0:06:59-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:06:59):**  mentioned the beginning.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:07:00):**  It wasn't because we were in the kitchen trying to figure out what to feed our child and no,  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:07:05):**  there was a, there's a more rational, and it's also very rational actually, but a different  
**[0:07:10-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:07:10):**  why, why you started, started with this.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:07:12):**  And of course your plans are much bigger than, than the first, let's say period we are eating  
**[0:07:19-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:07:19):**  a food that is not like potentially breast milk or, or milk in general.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:07:23):**  Why, why did you focus on that first 1000 days?  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:07:26):**  Is that science driven again?  
**[0:07:27-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:07:27):**  Is that what, what insight came there?  
**[0:07:30-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:07:30):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:07:31):**  So I come from the middle of Canada in Saskatchewan, which is one of the biggest farmlands in the  
**[0:07:36-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:07:36):**  world.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:07:37):**  My father is a chemistry professor fully dedicated to the farm industry.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:07:41):**  And so I grew up before, you know, just learning to walk and talk, but also learning how about  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:07:46):**  the chemistry of food and soil and growing.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:07:50):**  So I knew there was a better way to do things.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:07:53):**  I didn't know where this knowledge would come into my life or, or where I would need it  
**[0:07:57-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:07:57):**  later on.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:07:58):**  But growing up with, you know, the excitement of seeing your tomato plant grow because you  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:03):**  put eggshells that you had kept all year and then made this, you know, calcium phosphorus  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:07):**  distillation or we put Coke on the one beside it.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:12):**  So we like studied the impact of sugar on just life, let alone growth.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:17):**  As a young child, I had this inside of me that there was something wrong with sugar.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:22):**  You were doing these experiments basically in your back garden with your father.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:25):**  Our garden was a lab.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:26):**  The lab, it was amazing.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:27):**  Wow, side by side experiments.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:30):**  What was a shocking one?  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:31):**  I mean, sugar for, for tomato sounds interesting, but like you became, basically you make ketchup.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:36):**  What was that?  
**[0:08:37-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:37):**  Completely, yes.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:38):**  But the, it was really the impact of sugar.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:41):**  And of course my father knew all of this, right?  
**[0:08:43-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:43):**  He's a chemistry professor focused on all of this.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:45):**  And for me, it was fascinating to see this innocent little white powder that is in everything.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:51):**  And okay, I'm 43.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:52):**  So take back a few years.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:55):**  Nobody questioned putting sugar on everything.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:58):**  Nobody questioned anything on proper nutrition at this time.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:02):**  Which was very interesting, interestingly framed back in the day.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:05):**  If you go back, if you want to go into the conspiracy rabbit hole, like the whole fat  
**[0:09:09-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:09):**  versus sugar and how sugar became the issue and not fat with some very interesting lobbying.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:15):**  I'm laughing about it, but actually it's horrible.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:17):**  Very interesting lobbying from certain industries.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:21):**  And now we're starting to see sugar is driving a lot of this.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:25):**  It's sugar.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:26):**  It's not fat.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:27):**  It's sugar.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:28):**  It's not fat.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:29):**  Which is very, I mean, you saw already that even on like adding sugar to soil, fascinating.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:35):**  It changed its structure because even the soil changed its molecular structure.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:39):**  It changed its pH level.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:40):**  It changed its viscosity level.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:43):**  Again, as a young child, you don't know what all of this means, but you saw the change.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:48):**  And I think that's the important part also that you see it and you can be part of it.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:53):**  And you tasted it.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:54):**  Very, very young.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:55):**  Yes.  
**[0:09:56-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:56):**  Obviously.  
**[0:09:57-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:57):**  Oh my gosh.  
**[0:09:58-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:59):**  And that was the other thing.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:00):**  We put it on carrots and it made no taste.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:01):**  And actually the carrots didn't grow as big.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:03):**  So it's like the tomatoes collapsed when we put the Coke on it.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:06):**  But when we had our carrot row and one row, instead of just digging the seeds, we put  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:10):**  little sugar cubes in the bottom.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:13):**  They didn't grow as much.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:14):**  They were smaller.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:15):**  Now, I don't know any cause and effect on this, but as a child, these are the images  
**[0:10:19-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:19):**  that stayed with me for a lot.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:21):**  Of course.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:22):**  And even now drive a lot of the choices I make on how we look at the food company.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:27):**  And then how did you end up finding a baby food company in Germany?  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:33):**  Because you're the middle from farmland in Canada.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:37):**  That's literally culturally distance wise, pretty far.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:41):**  That's the other side of the world.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:43):**  But I met my husband doing my, we did our MBAs at Harvard together and he's German.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:48):**  And after business school, we moved to Europe and then we wanted to settle either Canada  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:53):**  or Germany and Munich came up.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:57):**  And I just think the city is amazing and beautiful and really based on an outside way of living.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:11:03):**  So I said, yeah, let's go for it.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:11:04):**  And we love the choice.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:11:06):**  And this is really one of the fundamental beginnings of pumpkin.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:11:12):**  I was working here and just feeling extremely down, no energy for years.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:11:19):**  I went to numerous doctors, like from TCM to, you know, Ayurvedic to traditional and  
**[0:11:25-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:11:25):**  nobody could solve what was happening.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:11:28):**  And this is one of the most frustrating aspects is people don't take general aches and pains  
**[0:11:35-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:11:35):**  in the body seriously.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:11:37):**  They just think, oh, you're too stressed.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:11:39):**  You're working too hard, blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:11:41):**  Every excuse under the sun.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:11:42):**  Anyways, after a couple of years, I was finally correctly diagnosed with Hashimoto's.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:11:47):**  And this, I left my job and I put the entire rigor and my passion for everything into solve  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:11:55):**  Hashimoto's or an autoimmune condition with food.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:11:59):**  You can't stop autoimmune, but you can slow it down and you can change the trajectory  
**[0:12:03-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:12:03):**  of your, you know, how it's going to work in your body.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:12:06):**  And this is where I started.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:12:08):**  One of the benefits of having a network like the Harvard network, as I called some of the  
**[0:12:13-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:12:13):**  most amazing doctors in the world.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:12:16):**  And I gave them these challenges.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:12:18):**  I want to solve this with food.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:12:20):**  And food means also how do we grow the food?  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:12:22):**  How do I get the right nutrients out of the food?  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:12:25):**  Because one of the biggest issues of our society is we eat food with a quarter of the nutritional  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:12:29):**  value that our parents and grandparents.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:12:32):**  If this sounds shocking to you, go and Google.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:12:34):**  There's some very interesting research recently and not so recent actually, but there seems  
**[0:12:40-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:12:40):**  to be a wave now around this and just a small spoiler alert.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:12:43):**  We're going to do a series on nutrient density and the connection to soil health and management.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:12:49):**  And I'll put a paper in the show notes below of David Montgomery and his wife, Anne, who  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:12:56):**  will hopefully have on the show soon as well that really connected, but there's so much  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:13:00):**  more research connecting what we do to the soil and what happens to our body once we  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:13:05):**  eat what came out of that soil, basically.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:13:08):**  Completely.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:13:09):**  And so I started really studying this and then working with the head of the nuclear  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:13:13):**  medical clinic here in Munich.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:13:15):**  He doesn't have a lot of belief in nutrition, but he cannot believe the change I made.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:13:22):**  And so we've been working together for years now.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:13:26):**  And so many people just said, Jacqueline, you've got to put this knowledge and passion  
**[0:13:30-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:13:30):**  into a company now.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:13:32):**  And I said, okay, but I'm going to find a way that I can really make an impact because  
**[0:13:36-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:13:36):**  at this stage in my life, it's not about a paycheck.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:13:38):**  It's not about building my CV.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:13:39):**  It's about actually producing a legacy of change.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:13:43):**  What made you change there or not change, but sort of the logical steps seems or seems  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:13:48):**  looking back at targeting that autoimmune disease or targeting helping others with the  
**[0:13:53-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:13:53):**  same to go through that process, etc, etc.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:13:56):**  But you said no, or maybe yes as well, but the company is going to be focusing on baby  
**[0:14:01-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:14:01):**  food or on the first thousand days.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:14:04):**  Because when you want to tackle a problem, you go to the beginning and the beginning  
**[0:14:08-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:14:08):**  is the baby.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:14:10):**  And I didn't know there was a problem with baby food.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:14:12):**  We didn't have a child at this point.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:14:15):**  I wasn't focused on this industry.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:14:17):**  I knew the big...  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:14:18):**  You heard your friends complaining about it, but it's sort of one ear in, one ear out.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:14:23):**  People complain about everything.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:14:24):**  So it wasn't like the trigger wasn't there.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:14:27):**  And I went and I thought, okay, easiest from the beginning.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:14:30):**  I went to the shelf of a big retailer here.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:14:35):**  And I literally had tears in my eyes.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:14:38):**  When I saw what was on the shelf, I could not believe that this was the offering in  
**[0:14:45-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:14:45):**  one of the wealthiest, most educated, resource rich, any positive adjective you can give  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:14:53):**  countries in the world.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:14:56):**  And we were giving children 200 jars, 200 pouches where 85% of the contents were apple,  
**[0:15:04-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:04):**  pear, and banana, a pureed fruit.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:07):**  And there is nothing in science that says this is the right way to start children's  
**[0:15:12-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:12):**  nutrition.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:13):**  And if there is, this doctor should be fired because he has no idea about nutrition.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:18):**  It's really shocking.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:20):**  It's really shocking.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:21):**  If you have children, I mean, you've looked at this for sure.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:24):**  If you're listening to this, if you don't, just next time you're in a supermarket or  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:27):**  in any shop that sells, just look at the ingredients.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:31):**  Your job will be on the floor.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:34):**  I promise you.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:35):**  Okay.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:36):**  So you saw that and were like, whoa.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:38):**  And I just said, this is it.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:39):**  This is now my life's mission.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:41):**  I'm going to change the trajectory of children's health by changing the children's food industry.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:46):**  And so why is that, that it's filled with those three ingredients are mainly apple,  
**[0:15:50-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:50):**  honestly, and banana.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:52):**  And it's the same, what we discussed previously, the let's replace it with something sweet  
**[0:15:59-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:59):**  or let's replace it with the cheapest, in some cases, organic ingredient, but still  
**[0:16:03-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:16:03):**  doesn't mean maybe the first thing they should eat.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:16:06):**  It's not the first thing they should eat.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:16:09):**  There are apple, smashed apples.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:16:12):**  And so what does the science say there actually?  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:16:14):**  What are the first things we all, when we get to food should start nibbling on or should  
**[0:16:19-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:16:19):**  start tasting?  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:16:22):**  You know, I'm not a vegetarian, but every child should start on vegetables.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:16:27):**  There is not a child can definitely have fruit.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:16:31):**  Okay.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:16:32):**  Don't get me wrong.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:16:33):**  But if you are going to eat fruit, the fructose in that fruit, if you don't have the fiber  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:16:36):**  from the whole food, it goes completely into the body as glucose.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:16:40):**  And it's not used as energy, it's stored in the body.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:16:43):**  So that's one aspect.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:16:44):**  The second aspect is our brains are formed in this first thousand days.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:16:49):**  80% of the brain is formed.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:16:52):**  So just think about how quickly a child, like when you had your little one and our little  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:16:57):**  one, like how quickly they learn to walk and talk and play and replicate everything you  
**[0:17:01-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:17:01):**  do.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:17:02):**  The learning curves are vertical.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:17:04):**  And it's the same with food.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:17:07):**  And the food is even worse because there is a chemical reaction in the body, in the brain,  
**[0:17:12-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:17:12):**  that when you put that pureed fruit in and sweetness, the brain says, oh, wow, yum, I  
**[0:17:17-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:17:17):**  want more of this.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:17:18):**  I'm going to crave more of it.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:17:20):**  I'm going to reject the bitter or the sour aspects of food, which you need to develop  
**[0:17:25-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:17:25):**  the taste palette on.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:17:26):**  I want this fruit or this bland flavoring.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:17:30):**  And so not only is it not providing the proper nutrition and giving way too much sugar into  
**[0:17:35-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:17:35):**  these tiny bodies, but it is actually training unhealthy eating habits that the child then  
**[0:17:41-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:17:41):**  will develop further and further.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:17:44):**  So this sugary, like trigger that we all notice is where as adults, etc, is formed or already  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:17:50):**  starts when you're super, super small.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:17:53):**  And we need to expose small ones at all the different flavors they are, which many are  
**[0:17:59-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:17:59):**  bitter and many are acidic and many are sour and many are, and we need to, and you're saying  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:18:05):**  this first year, I've even read first few months when you start eating also the allergy  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:18:10):**  discussions on nuts, expose, expose, expose, expose to all the different ones and not go  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:18:15):**  for fruity, sugary, etc.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:18:20):**  And so that dependency.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:18:23):**  So what is the alternative there?  
**[0:18:25-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:18:25):**  Like you started a company, like you just blend all the vegetables.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:18:28):**  Like how do we make sure we grow children into healthy eaters?  
**[0:18:34-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:18:34):**  Like what's that crucial?  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:18:37):**  Is that the full diversity just like in soil?  
**[0:18:39-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:18:39):**  Is it the exposure to things?  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:18:41):**  Is it the playing with it as well in a sense like it should be not a war, but a pleasure?  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:18:46):**  No, but you got to be ready for a battle.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:18:50):**  I mean, evolution of our brains is that when we taste bitter or sour, we think it's poison.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:18:55):**  That's the evolution of humanity with taste.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:18:58):**  So you cannot eliminate completely that the baby doesn't understand bitter or sour, but  
**[0:19:04-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:04):**  it can be trained like everything we do.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:07):**  And even here in Germany, the Midwife Association even says a new taste, a new food takes 8  
**[0:19:13-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:13):**  to 10 to 12 times to be introduced.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:16):**  So keep going, don't give up.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:18):**  Don't give up.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:19):**  Right.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:20):**  It's the same thing.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:21):**  Like if you go outside with a football and your child doesn't shoot a perfect 50-yard  
**[0:19:25-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:25):**  goal when they're two, you don't give up on sports.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:28):**  You're going to play tennis, right?  
**[0:19:30-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:30):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:31):**  Right.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:32):**  But it's the same thing.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:33):**  We have so much acceptance and patience in almost every aspect of learning, except when  
**[0:19:37-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:37):**  it comes to nutrition.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:38):**  We give up so easy.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:40):**  And one of the main drivers of that is that parents actually have very poor eating habits  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:46):**  or lack of knowledge themselves.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:50):**  Let's go there.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:51):**  Now, I mean, we had to go there obviously.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:52):**  So what, I mean, you have the baby food lines.  
**[0:19:56-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:56):**  Now let's first unpack a bit.  
**[0:19:57-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:57):**  What is pumpkin organics at the moment?  
**[0:19:59-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:59):**  And then we're going to talk about the two directions you can take it, obviously, like  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:20:02):**  as the child gets older, but also before, because you say, we want to go to the beginning,  
**[0:20:07-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:20:07):**  which is obviously not the moment at four and a half or four months or five months,  
**[0:20:10-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:20:10):**  depending on where they are, when they start eating, like it's earlier as well.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:20:13):**  So let's first say, okay, in a few sentences or a few more, currently we're in the late  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:20:19):**  spring of 2022, what is pumpkin organics and how would you describe it if you have to,  
**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:20:24):**  I wouldn't say pitch it, but if you have to present it, what do you, because you cannot  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:20:28):**  see it, but behind Jacqueline, there's a lot of food laid out, but obviously it is an audio  
**[0:20:33-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:20:33):**  podcast and we don't do video.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:20:35):**  So it's described to us what pumpkin organics is, where do you sell, who can get it, who  
**[0:20:39-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:20:39):**  can't unfortunately.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:20:40):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:20:41):**  So pumpkin organics, it's a food, it's basically, we want to be the leader in sustainable nutrition.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:20:49):**  We want to teach children with our food, primarily through snacks and through solution-based  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:20:57):**  food offerings for parents, that there is a way to help your children fall in love with  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:21:01):**  vegetables, to reduce their dependency on sugar, to teach them how to make good food  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:21:06):**  choices and do it with a lot of just incredibly yummy tasting food.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:21:11):**  So of course our products are all organic.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:21:14):**  We are actually the first baby food globally to be certified climate neutral.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:21:19):**  We are only one of the three companies in Europe that have recyclable pouches.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:21:25):**  So we really do prioritize the entire aspect of the food.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:21:31):**  Due to the limitations of the industry or the certification regulation processes and  
**[0:21:35-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:21:35):**  the complexity, there's still a lot we can't do.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:21:38):**  And so we also offer a lot of recipes and our voice of advice, like we're not doctors,  
**[0:21:45-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:21:45):**  we're not nutritionists.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:21:46):**  We are well educated, incredibly passionate people that want to help parents teach their  
**[0:21:53-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:21:53):**  children to make healthy, lifelong food decisions.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:21:57):**  And so you're selling online, you're selling in a number of stores, mostly in the, say  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:22:02):**  the German speaking region of Europe at the moment.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:22:06):**  And of course, with plans to go beyond that.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:22:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:22:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:22:10):**  We're primarily in, like you said, in the German speaking region and most retailers  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:22:13):**  in the organic stores as well.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:22:17):**  We're a quite large online store, which is fantastic because it allows us to directly  
**[0:22:22-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:22:22):**  connect with parents and we have wonderful discussions with them on the challenges they  
**[0:22:28-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:22:28):**  have.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:22:29):**  And yeah, it really feels in the last, I don't know, half a year, more and more people are  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:22:38):**  starting to value nutrition.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:22:41):**  And we really see a growth of the base and of more and more people willing to try what  
**[0:22:49-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:22:49):**  the child might not instantly like on phase one, which is a fruit poach.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:22:55):**  But actually dig into the complexity of building their diet based off of plants led by vegetables.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:23:00):**  Now, I suddenly remember when our daughter, which she never had actually normally, like  
**[0:23:06-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:23:06):**  fruit poaches and she finished one in one shot because of course it's like instant gratification  
**[0:23:13-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:23:13):**  and it's like, whoa, this is interesting.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:23:14):**  This is not what I normally get.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:23:17):**  And it's very interesting.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:23:19):**  Anyway, so what you mentioned, you highlighted something very interesting or you sort of  
**[0:23:24-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:23:24):**  mentioned it.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:23:25):**  There are a lot of things we cannot do yet or we cannot do in terms of regulation.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:23:30):**  And also because it's not that you have your own gigantic factory doing all of this, which  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:23:33):**  means you have fully control over where ingredients come from, etc.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:23:37):**  So describe the current situation between brackets and what you would like to do because  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:23:41):**  I'm imagining you would like to go beyond organic and start sourcing from the places  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:23:46):**  where because we all know, I mean, organic certification is amazing, but there's a whole  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:23:51):**  world beyond that.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:23:52):**  And it's a relatively low bar.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:23:54):**  So what's the current situation and what would you love to do in the near future?  
**[0:23:59-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:23:59):**  So the current situation is the demand for baby food is significant and it's growing  
**[0:24:07-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:24:07):**  driven by complexity with just knowledge and what do I feed my child?  
**[0:24:14-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:24:14):**  More women are going back to work earlier.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:24:16):**  So there is a higher reliance on commercial food, things like that.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:24:21):**  There's a lot of dynamics in the market that have created a quite large demand on the market.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:24:27):**  The regulation, the certification hasn't evolved too drastically over the years.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:24:35):**  So the fact that the core recipes that are on the shelves are the same ones that are  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:24:40):**  from 10, 15 years ago, it might be a new brand, it might be new packaging, but the core concept  
**[0:24:45-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:24:45):**  of the food hasn't evolved is one of my biggest areas that I really want to fight for.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:24:53):**  And also the core decision makers that are leaning the certification, the regulations  
**[0:24:58-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:24:58):**  of the food is the big companies, the big brands, the big agencies.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:25:05):**  And we need to get some new blood in there.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:25:07):**  We need to get some new thought.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:25:08):**  We need to get some people that actually truly want to drive the industry based on the science,  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:25:13):**  not based on cheap ingredients, accessibility of those ingredients, or what the baby is  
**[0:25:18-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:25:18):**  just saying, oh, I want more sugar.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:25:20):**  What's going to sell on the shelf?  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:25:22):**  Like you said, your daughter just slurped up a pouch.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:25:26):**  Something that's really important with our pouches is they're thick.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:25:30):**  So when the child actually takes the product into their mouth, they can't swallow it right  
**[0:25:36-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:25:36):**  away.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:25:37):**  They actually have to maneuver it within the mouth.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:25:38):**  They have to produce the saliva, which aids in the digestion and also which helps when  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:25:42):**  it gets into the gut with the bacteria.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:25:46):**  Also we started the company with a little spoon attachment to the pouch.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:25:51):**  So you can engage with the child.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:25:52):**  You can feed the child right away.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:25:55):**  So there's a lot of aspects of the industry that I was able to change just by my product  
**[0:26:02-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:26:02):**  offering.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:26:03):**  But it's been a very, very uphill battle because there was no category for our products at  
**[0:26:08-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:26:08):**  the beginning.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:26:09):**  And we're only talking five years ago.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:26:11):**  We're not talking 20 years ago.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:26:13):**  There was no vegetable category on the shelf.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:26:18):**  Everybody laughed at us when I told them what I wanted to do.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:26:21):**  They said, this will never sell.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:26:22):**  You're competing against mega incumbents, especially in Germany with the price point  
**[0:26:27-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:26:27):**  so low, what it is on the shelf, I can't even produce for.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:26:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:26:33):**  Because it's those cheap ingredients that are.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:26:36):**  But it is selling.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:26:38):**  Tons of things are buying, coming back and because they see, imagine they see the results.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:26:44):**  And so, but you are not able yet to select your farms, for instance, or to select, like  
**[0:26:50-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:26:50):**  go down all the way down to, okay, I want this tomato row and not that one where they  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:26:54):**  put organic coconut.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:26:56):**  No, because the complexity of how organic food for babies is still farmed and certified  
**[0:27:03-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:27:03):**  is very, very closed.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:27:06):**  So there are certain farms, of course, like a certified baby organic broccoli is different  
**[0:27:11-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:27:11):**  than an organic broccoli, different from a broccoli, etc.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:27:14):**  It's like completely a different category basically in terms of certification.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:27:18):**  Exactly.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:27:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:27:20):**  Because of the contaminant levels in the products and also what is allowed with fertilizers,  
**[0:27:25-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:27:25):**  etc.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:27:26):**  Which is a good thing.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:27:29):**  But it means it's very difficult to disrupt.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:27:30):**  It's not that you say, oh, let's use that broccoli.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:27:32):**  No, it's not from that certified farm and that certified field.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:27:36):**  And especially for a company like us that wanted to use a lot of ingredients that were  
**[0:27:40-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:27:40):**  beyond the core five fruits and vegetables.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:27:42):**  And nobody was certified basically.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:27:44):**  It was a nightmare to find certified red beets, for example, or quinoa, things like this within  
**[0:27:52-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:27:52):**  a acceptable travel distance to our plants.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:27:55):**  We have nothing coming from far, far away with the exception of the banana because they  
**[0:28:00-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:00):**  have all baby bananas come from Ecuador in Germany.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:03):**  We can't grow them here or in Italy or something.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:07):**  And so if you would grow, what would you need to do?  
**[0:28:11-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:11):**  Would you need to be double the size?  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:12):**  Is it in reach to start controlling more of that process?  
**[0:28:15-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:15):**  Do you need to be 10 times as much or do you say, okay, that's something that's a distant  
**[0:28:19-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:19):**  dream to be in full control?  
**[0:28:22-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:22):**  It needs to be the whole industry.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:23):**  The industry has to come together and say, enough is enough.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:27):**  We're going to grow proper ingredients and we're going to actually regulate the industry  
**[0:28:31-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:31):**  that we take away all full fruit pouches.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:34):**  There is no need for them in the market at all.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:37):**  We do not need anything with added sugar or juice or concentrate.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:40):**  There is not a single scientific benefit or health benefit to it.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:45):**  And we just have to actually put proper regulation in for what is acceptable baby food in that  
**[0:28:49-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:49):**  first thousand days.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:51):**  It should be all the way through our lifespan.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:53):**  Of course.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:54):**  We're going to talk about that.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:56):**  There's no way like this whole discussion now on soil health and the connection to the  
**[0:29:03-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:29:03):**  nutrient density or the quality of the produce.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:29:06):**  Are you going to introduce or try or that's impossible to say, okay, we know this farm  
**[0:29:12-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:29:12):**  near Munich that's doing amazing broccoli, for instance.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:29:14):**  And somehow we're going to try to as a little wedge to wedge it into our supply chain.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:29:20):**  We try, definitely.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:29:21):**  And we work with our plants as much as we can on it.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:29:24):**  Do they like it?  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:29:27):**  Are they interested in that kind of, or are you just a small and a bit annoying customer  
**[0:29:32-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:29:32):**  sometimes?  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:29:33):**  So we're definitely probably that small little annoying child that's always tugging at your  
**[0:29:38-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:29:38):**  –  
**[0:29:39-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:29:39):**  But why?  
**[0:29:40-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:29:40):**  But why?  
**[0:29:41-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:29:41):**  Exactly.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:29:42):**  But the thing is the plants and the R&D teams at the plants are amazing.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:29:45):**  They want to do more work like we do.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:29:49):**  But many of the incumbent brands and the customer base still isn't demanding it.  
**[0:29:54-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:29:54):**  So if you're a few percent of their customers, you're sort of the activist shareholder.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:30:01):**  But if you, I mean, you're still putting something on the agenda.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:30:04):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:30:05):**  And we are making change because we are the first people doing a lot of these formulas.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:30:10):**  And then you start to see them cropping up other places, which is wonderful.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:30:14):**  So this is like, even though we're one of the smallest brands, probably within the brand,  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:30:20):**  and not just the starting brand, we do have a loud voice and we do have a seat at the  
**[0:30:25-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:30:25):**  table at most of our plants, which is really fantastic.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:30:30):**  We get above our, I would say, share of resources in development and looking at different techniques  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:30:39):**  and working with the farmers, packaging techniques, processing techniques, because we're trying  
**[0:30:44-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:30:44):**  to change the industry and they see that.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:30:47):**  So in that respect, we are making small inroads, but for mega change to happen in this industry,  
**[0:30:55-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:30:55):**  it has to come from the institutionalized bodies that change the regulation and or basically  
**[0:31:02-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:31:02):**  the bigger brands coming together and say, no, we're done.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:31:05):**  We're not going to do that anymore because that is against what the science says for  
**[0:31:08-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:31:08):**  first nutrition.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:31:10):**  And let's take it to one step.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:31:12):**  And the demand for cheap food, now you're showing that there is demand for non-cheap  
**[0:31:17-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:31:17):**  food.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:31:18):**  Of course, there's a discussion or like, okay, if your price point is higher, what about  
**[0:31:24-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:31:24):**  accessibility?  
**[0:31:25-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:31:25):**  How do we tackle that?  
**[0:31:28-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:31:28):**  Or do you see like our stuff is brought by people throughout, let's say, income levels,  
**[0:31:34-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:31:34):**  et cetera, because people prioritize differently?  
**[0:31:36-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:31:36):**  Like, how do you see that?  
**[0:31:37-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:31:37):**  Are you for the happy few?  
**[0:31:39-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:31:39):**  I'm trying to ask, are you across the board for people that are targeting better health  
**[0:31:45-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:31:45):**  for their children?  
**[0:31:46-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:31:46):**  If I could, I mean, we are not making a higher margin on our product.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:31:52):**  I do not believe access to health should be driven by your socioeconomic position or your  
**[0:31:57-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:31:57):**  postcode at all.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:31:59):**  I think this should be actually part of the government's platforms, first nutrition, that  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:32:04):**  every child gets an equal start, both from an education and a product access point of  
**[0:32:09-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:32:09):**  view.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:32:10):**  So what we've actually tried to do is, of course, we sell our product at the normal  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:32:16):**  product price, which is about 20% above the market.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:32:21):**  But that's a big amount in some markets.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:32:24):**  Especially if you see it next to each other.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:32:27):**  That's the problem always, because it's really on the shelf.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:32:31):**  It's just really framing wise.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:32:33):**  You might buy, I don't know, you spend it so much easier on electronics and things like  
**[0:32:39-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:32:39):**  that.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:32:40):**  But if you're standing in that show, you're thinking like, oh, 20%.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:32:42):**  Like one euro items, right?  
**[0:32:45-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:32:45):**  I know.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:32:46):**  People make choices based on 10, 15 cents, but yet you go and buy the iPhone 12, I don't  
**[0:32:51-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:32:51):**  know what number we're on 15, 16 now.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:32:54):**  You know, we're not even thinking twice about it.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:32:58):**  And so this is what I mean, where, you know, if we, when you asked about what we could  
**[0:33:02-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:02):**  change, one of the single biggest things is education.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:05):**  Because if people actually knew really what they were doing to their bodies, I think it  
**[0:33:10-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:10):**  would change that 15, 20 cents decision.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:14):**  And any person who is going to the market on the weekend or any day, you see the price  
**[0:33:19-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:19):**  of an organic broccoli, of an organic sweet potato.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:22):**  We can't do it for the price of an apple.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:24):**  We just can't.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:25):**  It's impossible.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:27):**  And so even just the ingredient amount that we spent, the rest of the production costs  
**[0:33:32-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:32):**  are relatively the same.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:33):**  Packaging is the same.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:34):**  We all have the same packaging or relative, you know.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:38):**  It's ingredients.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:39):**  Is that what you would change if you had one?  
**[0:33:41-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:41):**  I'm bringing the magic wand question in already.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:44):**  Like what would you change overnight if you had that power?  
**[0:33:47-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:47):**  Would it be education or like good nutrition, science-based nutrition, education for all?  
**[0:33:53-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:53):**  Yeah, I would.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:54):**  It would be the, it's the root of the absolute needed change in society.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:59):**  People don't inherently wake up one morning and say, oh, I'm going to feed my child bad  
**[0:34:03-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:34:03):**  today or I'm not, it's okay if my child gets a lifestyle disease later on because I didn't  
**[0:34:10-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:34:10):**  treat them well when they were a baby.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:34:12):**  No parent does that.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:34:14):**  Everyone wakes up.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:34:15):**  I want the best for my child.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:34:16):**  I want to give them the best that I can do, that I know about, that I have access and  
**[0:34:20-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:34:20):**  that I can afford.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:34:21):**  Right?  
**[0:34:22-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:34:22):**  You're not that literal, but that's your mentality as a mom and as a dad or whoever the caregiver  
**[0:34:26-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:34:26):**  is.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:34:29):**  But it's not what we offer.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:34:31):**  It's not what society offers.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:34:33):**  There's so much marketing washing, green washing, health washing on products that if you don't  
**[0:34:39-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:34:39):**  have a medical degree, a chemistry degree, a scientific research background, it's really  
**[0:34:45-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:34:45):**  unfair to put these labels in front of you, to put these products on the shelf when it's  
**[0:34:51-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:34:51):**  85, 90, 95% of the shelf at trusted retailers by trusted brands, you trust it.  
**[0:34:58-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:34:58):**  That's human nature.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:34:59):**  That's what we have to do.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:35:00):**  We have no other choice.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:35:02):**  So if we don't change the way we treat people and by respecting their intelligence and actually  
**[0:35:10-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:35:10):**  educating them fairly, it's extremely difficult to blame them for making decisions that are  
**[0:35:17-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:35:17):**  maybe not a hundred percent optimal for their child's health.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:35:21):**  And how do we take it even one step before?  
**[0:35:23-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:35:23):**  Is it first nutrition?  
**[0:35:24-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:35:24):**  But of course it's not the first nutrition.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:35:25):**  It's the first nutrition happens in the womb and then happens with breastfeeding or whatever  
**[0:35:31-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:35:31):**  milk you end up using.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:35:34):**  So I know you're thinking about it.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:35:36):**  There's nothing on the market yet.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:35:38):**  Because the first thousand days I think includes the pregnancy.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:35:40):**  Yes, and it includes the belly.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:35:42):**  In the UNICEF definition, that thousand days is the first three years including the nine  
**[0:35:48-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:35:48):**  months and actually potentially even including the few months before.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:35:52):**  I'm just going to quote Jeremy Grantham, the founder of GMO, which is badly named, but  
**[0:35:56-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:35:56):**  it's a value investor that wrote a paper.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:35:59):**  Now he's the G of it.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:36:01):**  It's nothing to do with GMOs, but it was 50 years ago, I think they mentioned it.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:36:08):**  But he wrote a paper on chemical toxicity in the baby bust, which I highly recommend.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:36:12):**  He sent it always institutional investors.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:36:15):**  So all of this ended up in the boardrooms because he's such a respected investor of  
**[0:36:20-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:36:20):**  pension funds, etc.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:36:21):**  And he was talking about the baby bust and toxicity.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:36:25):**  And he said, for the immediate present, I do feel a moral imperative to urge anyone  
**[0:36:29-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:36:29):**  pregnant to eat nothing but organic fruit and vegetables, let's say vegetables mostly,  
**[0:36:34-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:36:34):**  for the duration and meant for six months prior.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:36:38):**  For more about this, please see the appendix.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:36:40):**  I will link it below.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:36:42):**  That period before or the start even, how would you approach that?  
**[0:36:47-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:36:47):**  Would that be in the future of the company?  
**[0:36:49-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:36:49):**  Is that another company?  
**[0:36:50-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:36:50):**  Is that like, what do you feel about that actually first nutrition even before the whole  
**[0:36:55-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:36:55):**  process starts?  
**[0:36:56-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:36:56):**  It's vital.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:36:57):**  I mean, the success and health of our society starts in the belly.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:37:00):**  There's no doubt.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:37:02):**  And when you eat well, you feel well, right?  
**[0:37:06-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:37:06):**  Because there's also so much, not just nutritional science, but mental well-being science in  
**[0:37:10-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:37:10):**  the pregnancy that if you are happy and smiling, your baby is going to come out happier and  
**[0:37:15-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:37:15):**  more ready to adjust and learn.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:37:18):**  And every single thing we do is a domino effect.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:37:22):**  So first nutrition absolutely starts with the mom.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:37:26):**  I mean, or whoever, like the pregnant aspect of it and majority.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:37:32):**  And we have to start educating women when they are in the school system, when they are  
**[0:37:39-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:37:39):**  in just products on the shelf.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:37:41):**  When we start talking about any aspects of getting pregnant or being pregnant, there  
**[0:37:46-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:37:46):**  is no nutrition knowledge you get from the standard midwife program in Germany, which  
**[0:37:53-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:37:53):**  is amazing.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:37:54):**  Germany has this system where almost every mom gets a midwife to help them through the  
**[0:37:57-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:37:57):**  process.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:37:58):**  None of them have nutrition or very, very few, I shouldn't say none.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:38:01):**  There's probably some exceptions.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:38:03):**  There is more instructions on your IKEA bookshelf than you get on nutrition when you're pregnant  
**[0:38:10-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:38:10):**  or when you go to the appointments for your doctor around six months, five, six months  
**[0:38:15-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:38:15):**  to get a guide on how to feed your child.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:38:18):**  It's absolutely – everyone is left alone.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:38:21):**  And when you're left alone and you have no idea what's happening in your body, what's  
**[0:38:24-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:38:24):**  happening in the world around you, you are so anxious.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:38:27):**  You find bits of knowledge that you grab onto.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:38:30):**  And this often comes from your parents, right?  
**[0:38:33-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:38:33):**  Your mom or your grandma or your friends around you or completely random influencer strangers  
**[0:38:40-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:38:40):**  that are more worried about their bikini body.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:38:42):**  Exactly.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:38:43):**  During the pregnancy.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:38:44):**  But this is where they get a lot of their nutrition knowledge from.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:38:47):**  This is so unfair to women.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:38:50):**  You cannot – like you can't expect women just to wake up one morning and have this  
**[0:38:54-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:38:54):**  nutrition halo above them telling their brain what decisions to make when we as an entire  
**[0:39:00-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:39:00):**  society do not actually put anything forth to help educate them.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:39:05):**  So I would love to move our company forward to what we call the belly.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:39:11):**  And it's actually one of the reasons that we are going to start the larger funding round  
**[0:39:15-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:39:15):**  now is we feel that we have a very, very big opportunity to help because we truly care.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:39:23):**  It's not just about finding the next big product at the cheapest margin.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:39:28):**  We truly really think we can have an impact on women's wellbeing driven by nutrition  
**[0:39:33-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:39:33):**  during the pregnancy phase.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:39:37):**  And that seems really like a complete blue ocean.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:39:41):**  I mean, there's – of course, you should take this vitamin and that.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:39:47):**  But that's pretty much it.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:39:48):**  There's nothing on nutrition.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:39:49):**  That's it.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:39:50):**  That's all you get.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:39:51):**  There's also nothing on nutrition.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:39:52):**  I've seen some complaints about other so little research on like breastfeeding versus  
**[0:39:58-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:39:58):**  not and things like that.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:39:59):**  And there's one randomized control trial somewhere I think they did in Belarus.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:40:03):**  But nobody asked the question like what were the women eating?  
**[0:40:06-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:40:06):**  Like what was feeding?  
**[0:40:07-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:40:07):**  Because it's not politically sexy.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:40:10):**  It's not that the breast milk comes out of thin air.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:40:13):**  You have to eat something to make and it's a very –  
**[0:40:16-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:40:16):**  You have to eat a lot of nutritious food to produce a nut milk.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:40:20):**  And that should be the focus there.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:40:22):**  And then we go one step forward.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:40:23):**  So what would that look like if you have any of those?  
**[0:40:25-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:40:25):**  Would that be specific like packages for pregnant women or like crucial ones also there?  
**[0:40:33-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:40:33):**  Because are there connections?  
**[0:40:34-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:40:34):**  I would love to know if there's research like whatever the women were eating during pregnancy,  
**[0:40:39-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:40:39):**  does that result in less picky eaters later?  
**[0:40:43-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:40:43):**  Because also there you're feeding the child obviously indirectly but very directly.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:40:47):**  So there's definitely in the first thousand days research, some anecdotal studies from  
**[0:40:55-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:40:55):**  the pregnancy side that if the mom ate a lot of cucumbers, the child loves cucumbers.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:40:59):**  If the child ate a lot of sugar or laddened food, the child comes out.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:41:03):**  But honestly, this is beyond just that connection in the belly because if the mommy didn't eat  
**[0:41:10-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:41:10):**  that well when the baby was in the belly, they're going to continue those eating patterns  
**[0:41:13-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:41:13):**  after.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:41:14):**  And when you think of how much knowledge the child absorbs every day, they see that.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:41:18):**  This is what they're going to be served.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:41:20):**  So there are not that many hardcore studies that have been lasted over generations yet  
**[0:41:28-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:41:28):**  or peer reviewed to the nines on this topic because it is so sensitive in the number of  
**[0:41:34-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:41:34):**  variables when a woman is pregnant.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:41:37):**  That for the research to truly be verified, I think would be extremely difficult.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:41:42):**  Just to be sure, we know the direction.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:41:45):**  I think there was David Lezak and Mandy Ellerton where we had them on the podcast, on a webinar  
**[0:41:52-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:41:52):**  actually and they researched this connection between their human health nexus and regenerative  
**[0:41:57-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:41:57):**  agriculture.  
**[0:41:58-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:41:58):**  So we'll never know all the details.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:41:59):**  We'll never know all the nuances and all the variables.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:42:01):**  But the direction is very, very, very clear.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:42:03):**  There is a strong connection between the two.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:42:05):**  So we better start acting because otherwise we're going to wait 20 years for all the peer  
**[0:42:08-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:42:08):**  reviewed papers to come out and then we're too late.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:42:11):**  We probably are a bit late already.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:42:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:42:13):**  When you look at the rising obesity rates, the rising rates that children don't actually  
**[0:42:19-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:42:19):**  understand nutrition, we are at a critical turning point.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:42:24):**  But the reality is with regenerative aspects of farming, the point is we can make a change.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:42:33):**  This is in our control and that's the wonderful thing about it.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:42:40):**  It's not revolutionary.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:42:41):**  It's just small changes taking an evolutionary approach to lifestyle changes is going to  
**[0:42:49-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:42:49):**  move the dial.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:42:51):**  And I think-  
**[0:42:52-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:42:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:42:53):**  We're not lost.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:42:54):**  We're not lost.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:42:55):**  And that's, I think, maybe one of the main rediscoveries, I would say, because obviously  
**[0:42:59-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:42:59):**  for generations and generations in indigenous peoples, we knew this, but the fact that soil  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:43:05):**  can come back relatively quickly, depending how we treat it and the mirroring effect of  
**[0:43:10-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:43:10):**  the soil microbiome and our gut microbiome suggests that we can do similar steps in a  
**[0:43:16-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:43:16):**  few years or a few months, or we've all heard these miracle stories, but it is at least  
**[0:43:23-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:43:23):**  reversible to a certain extent.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:43:25):**  Obviously, we're not going to treat everything, please don't start writing about this, but  
**[0:43:29-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:43:29):**  there's enormous steps to be taken and to be made in relatively like in geology time,  
**[0:43:36-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:43:36):**  like in nothing, basically in a blimp in history, we can do a lot of things.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:43:40):**  So what would you tell smart investors?  
**[0:43:45-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:43:45):**  Let's say we're in a theater full of finance people that are all dressed up.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:43:50):**  Obviously, we're on stage, we're doing this, and then the question is, okay, what would  
**[0:43:55-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:43:55):**  we like to give them to them without obviously giving them investment advice, but what would  
**[0:43:59-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:43:59):**  you like to tell them when they walk out of the theater?  
**[0:44:02-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:44:02):**  What should they do the next day or the next morning or even evening itself, apart from  
**[0:44:06-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:44:06):**  feeding their children, if they haven't, very differently, but like what should they focus  
**[0:44:10-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:44:10):**  their work energy on, their mental energy to spend their days on not just in the weekends  
**[0:44:14-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:44:14):**  when they read the financial times, how to spend it.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:44:17):**  I want them to spend a week on this as well, their work life.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:44:21):**  What should they dig deeper into?  
**[0:44:23-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:44:23):**  What should they look for?  
**[0:44:25-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:44:25):**  Where should we guide them?  
**[0:44:26-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:44:26):**  So this kind of feels like some of my daily discussions at times because a lot of investors  
**[0:44:33-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:44:33):**  and a lot of capital is being put behind very marketing shiny companies that probably won't  
**[0:44:41-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:44:41):**  actually impact society positively in the next few months, years, or even decades.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:44:49):**  It's probably a little bit further out to have that exponential or multiplying effect  
**[0:44:53-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:44:53):**  on the health and happiness of society.  
**[0:44:56-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:44:56):**  So that would be the first thing is truly find companies that the change or the product  
**[0:45:02-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:45:02):**  they're working on has an ability to impact in the short term because there's a lot of  
**[0:45:07-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:45:07):**  money that are going behind big ideas.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:45:11):**  Like for example, the alternative meat investment just insane amounts.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:45:18):**  It's crazy.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:45:19):**  That's great, but why don't we just teach kids to eat proper plants now?  
**[0:45:25-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:45:25):**  Why do we need to have all these...  
**[0:45:27-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:45:27):**  Okay, I'm not talking about like we need to find alternative proteins through insects  
**[0:45:30-0:45:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:45:30):**  and all that.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:45:31):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:45:32):**  Because there's just so many people coming, we have to feed them.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:45:33):**  We have to make sure they get enough protein and B12 and folic acid, et cetera.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:45:38):**  But the amount of research that is behind making a hamburger look like it bleeds or  
**[0:45:42-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:45:42):**  a plant-based hamburger in the way a regular hamburger does.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:45:46):**  You could subsidize all children in Germany to eat better for the first thousand.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:45:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:45:50):**  I don't understand that.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:45:51):**  Why can investors not actually see the impact of today?  
**[0:45:56-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:45:56):**  That we actually look at societal changes, behavioral changes, things that will impact  
**[0:46:01-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:46:01):**  a huge society on mass.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:46:04):**  Not that we can just afford the big celebrity investors to come and back products that may  
**[0:46:11-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:46:11):**  or may not actually change.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:46:12):**  Then you have to be forced to really look at the Excel or look at the numbers and calculate  
**[0:46:19-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:46:19):**  what could be done this year, next year.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:46:21):**  Not just because these numbers are always very interesting of the year, three or four,  
**[0:46:25-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:46:25):**  the hockey stick starts to go up, let's say.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:46:28):**  In many cases, it doesn't happen, but we like to believe in the dream of disrupting everything  
**[0:46:33-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:46:33):**  in a few years and forgetting that true disruption takes much longer.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:46:37):**  Even the disruption stories we tell ourselves are usually 10, 15 years in the making, which  
**[0:46:41-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:46:41):**  is still nothing on the large timescale of things.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:46:45):**  No, no.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:46:46):**  But there's a huge amount of investment required behind what I always call non-sexy industries  
**[0:46:52-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:46:52):**  or products that truly impact today's society.  
**[0:46:57-0:46:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:46:57):**  This would be the big thing.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:46:58):**  I always try to ask if investors don't follow the herd, be an original thinker, be an original  
**[0:47:06-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:47:06):**  backer, and back things that are truly important to society today that can make an impact today.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:47:13):**  Then back the big ideas, but know that that's your longer-term bet and bring some of the  
**[0:47:18-0:47:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:47:18):**  funding into the nearer term.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:47:20):**  It should be a barbell strategy.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:47:22):**  85%, as Nancy in the lab says, 85 in boring, non-sexy, but very important things, and 15  
**[0:47:30-0:47:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:47:30):**  for the crazy wild moon shots with Google and things like that.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:47:33):**  Could you imagine the impact on our society if we took 25% of our healthcare costs out  
**[0:47:38-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:47:38):**  of the system?  
**[0:47:40-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:47:40):**  If we actually reduced sick days by 10, 15%, if we increased productivity by 20%.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:47:47):**  These are metrics that we can control.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:47:50):**  For that, we don't need to invest billions and billions into meatless hamburgers.  
**[0:47:56-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:47:56):**  We need to actually...  
**[0:47:57-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:47:57):**  Or AI and robotics.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:47:58):**  Or AI, or I always say autonomous flying helicopters, which are super cool stuff.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:48:03):**  But the impact is needed now where children and parents are making very, very big decisions.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:48:11):**  What would you do if you were in charge of a billion dollar fund?  
**[0:48:15-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:48:15):**  Oh, gosh.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:48:16):**  A billion euro.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:48:17):**  Sorry, let's bring it to Europe.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:48:18):**  A billion euro fund, what would you focus on?  
**[0:48:21-0:48:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:48:21):**  I'm starting to guess 850 million goes to non-sexy stuff.  
**[0:48:25-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:48:25):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:48:26):**  Right?  
**[0:48:27-0:48:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:48:27):**  Really, two big things.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:48:28):**  One is that every single mom, when they become pregnant all the way to first nutrition, there's  
**[0:48:34-0:48:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:48:34):**  a plan.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:48:35):**  It's financially covered or at least subsidized.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:48:38):**  That every single baby coming into this world and child has a fair start for their brain  
**[0:48:43-0:48:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:48:43):**  to be developed, their bodies to be developed, and that they can start in a healthy and happy  
**[0:48:47-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:48:47):**  way, and really lead to a contributing members of society.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:48:52):**  Much like in the Scandinavian countries, when you go home with the baby, you get this little  
**[0:48:55-0:49:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:48:55):**  box with a basic thing of diapers and some new clothes, and it's got a bed.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:49:01):**  So basically, their point is that every single child in their first few months has a place  
**[0:49:05-0:49:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:49:05):**  to sleep, is going to be fed, have the right diapers, et cetera.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:49:10):**  We need to do that, but we need to focus on the pregnant women or the baby in the belly,  
**[0:49:15-0:49:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:49:15):**  and then that first nutrition.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:49:19):**  We have to start the education system, not just teaching people to eat vegetables, but  
**[0:49:26-0:49:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:49:26):**  we need to create storytellers.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:49:30):**  Society changes by stories because it's peer to peer if it's influencer, if it's from a  
**[0:49:34-0:49:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:49:34):**  healthcare practitioner, if it's even on this podcast, we're telling stories, which people  
**[0:49:39-0:49:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:49:39):**  listen to and they attack.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:49:40):**  Vegetables, no fruit.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:49:41):**  If you remember one thing, vegetables, no fruit.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:49:44):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:49:45):**  That's right.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:49:46):**  And this is the point, I would also really invest in opportunities on how do we educate  
**[0:49:51-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:49:51):**  on nutrition and soil and farming.  
**[0:49:54-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:49:54):**  Where does the carrot come from?  
**[0:49:57-0:50:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:49:57):**  You know, kids actually have answered Amazon delivery, some of these questions.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:50:01):**  This is such a scary part of society.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:50:03):**  We need to get, this would be my next investment vertical, education systems into the daycares,  
**[0:50:10-0:50:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:50:10):**  the kindergartens and the schools.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:50:12):**  Put a garden in every single kindergarten.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:50:16):**  Teach the children how to grow the food, how to nurture the vegetables, how to harvest  
**[0:50:21-0:50:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:50:21):**  the vegetables, how to cook it together.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:50:23):**  If a child actually goes through this, it's not just their knowledge on the food that  
**[0:50:26-0:50:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:50:26):**  will increase, but food waste will drastically decrease because they see how much hard work  
**[0:50:31-0:50:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:50:31):**  they put into creating that carrot.  
**[0:50:33-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:50:33):**  They will eat it.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:50:34):**  And they will eat it with such great pride and they'll want to share it.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:50:39):**  So there's so much that we can do to actually create this grassroots demand for better soil  
**[0:50:45-0:50:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:50:45):**  conditions, better aspects to growing because people, once they become healthier, when you  
**[0:50:50-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:50:50):**  are healthier, you demand healthier aspects of life.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:50:54):**  And then once you get beyond just how to eat, not just sugar food, but vegetables, you're  
**[0:50:58-0:51:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:50:58):**  going to say, how do I make that broccoli healthier?  
**[0:51:01-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:51:01):**  And this is the change I think that we can drive by doing basic things in the school  
**[0:51:06-0:51:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:51:06):**  system, the KEDA system.  
**[0:51:08-0:51:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:51:08):**  And then when children are older, we should have mandatory cooking classes in the schools,  
**[0:51:14-0:51:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:51:14):**  mandatory agriculture classes in the schools.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:51:18):**  Because if you took food away, we don't really have a society, right?  
**[0:51:21-0:51:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:51:21):**  Like we're done.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:51:23):**  And these are the big things I would really invest behind.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:51:27):**  And my next one would be the farmers.  
**[0:51:32-0:51:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:51:32):**  Coming from a farming area, it's not an easy life being a farmer.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:51:37):**  And often the techniques that are out there in the amazing science, right, from crops,  
**[0:51:43-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:51:43):**  from biodiversity, from crop swapping, different aspects of like, what is the next level of  
**[0:51:50-0:51:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:51:50):**  organic, like you said, this takes investment.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:51:53):**  This takes funding.  
**[0:51:54-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:51:54):**  And a lot of the farmers are just fighting day by day to get across and feed their families.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:52:00):**  So I would really put a proper amount of the investment in to move farmers from conventional  
**[0:52:06-0:52:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:52:06):**  agriculture into this, not just organic, but what is the next level and its regenerative,  
**[0:52:13-0:52:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:52:13):**  which we know now, but then what is the next thing that we can have this holistic approach  
**[0:52:17-0:52:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:52:17):**  that we can meet the food demand, but healthier, more valuable food.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:52:23):**  And putting your MBA hat on, like the first few you mentioned education, and making sure  
**[0:52:30-0:52:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:52:30):**  that every child, let's say in Germany or in Europe, or obviously globally, has access  
**[0:52:34-0:52:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:52:34):**  to the right food at the beginning, is there a way or maybe there isn't, but is there a  
**[0:52:39-0:52:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:52:39):**  way to frame that or somehow figure out a way to attract investment amount toward because  
**[0:52:44-0:52:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:52:44):**  there's always this, a nonprofit should do this probably in a certain way.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:52:50):**  But at the same time, the amount of nonprofit money available is nothing compared to the  
**[0:52:58-0:53:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:52:58):**  investment amount available for crazy moonshot stuff.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:53:00):**  But how could we frame this in a way like, okay, if we run this program, we create enough  
**[0:53:06-0:53:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:53:06):**  demand for companies like Pumpkin Organics to grow up, how could we connect it to, unfortunately,  
**[0:53:11-0:53:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:53:11):**  a financial outcome?  
**[0:53:13-0:53:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:53:13):**  How would you do that?  
**[0:53:14-0:53:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:53:14):**  How would you structure it in a way as an investment?  
**[0:53:18-0:53:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:53:18):**  Yeah, you need to run it as if you're trying to build the next billion dollar entity, or  
**[0:53:24-0:53:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:53:24):**  if you're running a middle stock company or something, you have to run it as a for-profit  
**[0:53:30-0:53:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:53:30):**  to build a sustainable business model company.  
**[0:53:32-0:53:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:53:32):**  I think one of the reasons a lot of the things I mentioned don't get the funding they need  
**[0:53:36-0:53:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:53:36):**  is because they're often managed by nonprofits or by government agencies.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:53:41):**  And through bureaucracy or lack of speed or agility or inability to attract talent you  
**[0:53:49-0:53:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:53:49):**  need to drive a business, it takes 10 years, 15 years, a lot of frustrations, maybe 5x  
**[0:53:54-0:53:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:53:54):**  the budget.  
**[0:53:55-0:53:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:53:55):**  I don't know.  
**[0:53:56-0:53:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:53:56):**  I mean, I'm not trying to discredit it.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:53:57):**  But if you actually started running every single nonprofit topic as a for-profit and  
**[0:54:02-0:54:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:54:02):**  built a proper business model behind it with proper checks and balances and investors,  
**[0:54:08-0:54:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:54:08):**  you can actually, I think, change the business models behind these.  
**[0:54:12-0:54:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:54:12):**  Because there is a business model behind health.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:54:14):**  We know that, right?  
**[0:54:15-0:54:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:54:15):**  Food tech, health tech, all of these are the biggest growing or some of the biggest growing  
**[0:54:19-0:54:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:54:19):**  investment pools in venture.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:54:23):**  But where the venture dollars are going are behind teams is because the idea is only the  
**[0:54:29-0:54:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:54:29):**  very small part of where the venture money goes at the beginning.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:54:32):**  It's behind the team, right?  
**[0:54:34-0:54:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:54:34):**  You invest in the founder, you invest in the team.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:54:37):**  And these teams are often not the people that are running the nonprofit.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:54:41):**  So I'm not trying to be disparaging.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:54:43):**  I actually think it's quite positive and quite exciting that if we actually invested behind  
**[0:54:50-0:54:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:54:50):**  people that have the passion and purpose for a lot of these traditionally nonprofit topics,  
**[0:54:54-0:54:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:54:54):**  they will figure out a business model.  
**[0:54:55-0:54:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:54:55):**  They will do it.  
**[0:54:56-0:54:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:54:56):**  Because we've done it before.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:54:58):**  And it might be with insurance companies.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:55:01):**  You need to figure out where the savings are being made or where the-  
**[0:55:05-0:55:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:55:05):**  Why are the insurance companies not backing first nutrition?  
**[0:55:08-0:55:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:55:08):**  Nutrition.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:55:09):**  Why?  
**[0:55:10-0:55:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:55:10):**  This is mind-boggling.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:55:11):**  And in Germany, like where we are, this is the land of insurance companies, right?  
**[0:55:16-0:55:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:55:16):**  It's mind-boggling how many insurance companies here and the power they hold.  
**[0:55:19-0:55:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:55:19):**  But I've never seen a single, not a single one of them have called us.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:55:23):**  Not a single one have said, hey, how can we get involved to help or do something?  
**[0:55:28-0:55:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:55:28):**  And I don't think any other like really truly signs back to the company is getting the calls.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:55:36):**  That's really interesting.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:55:37):**  It's just easier to pay to put the bandaid on or put more beds into the hospital or to  
**[0:55:42-0:55:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:55:42):**  ex-revive later in life versus actually trying to solve a bigger problem.  
**[0:55:49-0:55:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:55:49):**  And it's also not politically sexy because no politician is going to get elected by saying,  
**[0:55:53-0:55:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:55:53):**  oh, we're going to give children a fairer start in life.  
**[0:55:56-0:56:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:55:56):**  No, we're going to prevent the next part of the next effects of the pandemic.  
**[0:56:00-0:56:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:56:00):**  We're going to prevent.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:56:02):**  It's very, but you see societies not changing.  
**[0:56:05-0:56:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:56:05):**  You mentioned like the last six months or last year, it's like nutrition and health  
**[0:56:09-0:56:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:56:09):**  and food seem to have at least a different spotlight on it now.  
**[0:56:13-0:56:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:56:13):**  And there seem to be changes in, at least changes in choices we made.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:56:18):**  I mean, of course, a lot of local ones exploded during the pandemic because we couldn't get  
**[0:56:22-0:56:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:56:22):**  anywhere or we couldn't get access to the supermarket or things were finished.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:56:26):**  And from the flower boom to where do I get my eggs to where do I get my vegetables, et  
**[0:56:31-0:56:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:56:31):**  cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:56:32-0:56:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:56:32):**  And some of that stayed luckily.  
**[0:56:33-0:56:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:56:33):**  And I think people got used to different flavors and tastes.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:56:36):**  And now the question is, how do we sustain that?  
**[0:56:39-0:56:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:56:39):**  And how do we scale it?  
**[0:56:42-0:56:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:56:42):**  And as a final question, I mean, this is a whole different rabbit hole we just touched  
**[0:56:46-0:56:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:56:46):**  upon, but I find it fascinating.  
**[0:56:48-0:56:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:56:48):**  There will be another interview to unpack, okay, how do we take traditional nonprofit  
**[0:56:53-0:57:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:56:53):**  areas and invest in them with the specific focus of turning them into a large impact  
**[0:57:02-0:57:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:57:02):**  business models?  
**[0:57:03-0:57:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:57:03):**  That's a different episode.  
**[0:57:04-0:57:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:57:04):**  We'll come back to that at some point.  
**[0:57:06-0:57:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:57:06):**  But now as a last question, where do you, I mean, there are many like vegetables versus  
**[0:57:10-0:57:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:57:10):**  fruit, but where do you, when you go to your, I don't know if they're peer conferences,  
**[0:57:15-0:57:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:57:15):**  for shorter conferences of baby food, when you go there, what's the biggest one that  
**[0:57:19-0:57:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:57:19):**  you feel, even if you go to the organic more, say healthy side of the aisle, where do you  
**[0:57:26-0:57:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:57:26):**  think most differently?  
**[0:57:28-0:57:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:57:28):**  Is that the vegetable versus fruit?  
**[0:57:30-0:57:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:57:30):**  Is it something else?  
**[0:57:31-0:57:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:57:31):**  I love to ask this question, what do you believe to be true about region ag, but in this case  
**[0:57:35-0:57:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:57:35):**  about baby food that others don't believe to be true?  
**[0:57:38-0:57:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:57:38):**  And this definitely comes from John Kempf as an inspiration.  
**[0:57:43-0:57:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:57:43):**  So I think what I believe to be true that I don't think many of my industry peers is  
**[0:57:49-0:57:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:57:49):**  that first food actually matters.  
**[0:57:54-0:58:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:57:54):**  That we need to actually care, like if we truly cared for the child and their upbringing  
**[0:58:02-0:58:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:58:02):**  and their ability to lead a healthier and happier life, we would be really vegetables,  
**[0:58:09-0:58:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:58:09):**  plant-based, no pureed fruit, no sugar, no additives.  
**[0:58:13-0:58:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:58:13):**  I don't think the formula is crazy.  
**[0:58:15-0:58:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:58:15):**  I don't think it's complicated.  
**[0:58:18-0:58:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:58:18):**  And then the other aspect is healthy people are going to demand healthy food, right?  
**[0:58:24-0:58:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:58:24):**  Once we get people healthy, you don't want to go back to feeling sick.  
**[0:58:26-0:58:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:58:26):**  You don't want to go back to pain in the body.  
**[0:58:28-0:58:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:58:28):**  And healthy food comes from healthy soil, healthy land.  
**[0:58:33-0:58:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:58:33):**  And I really believe that we can, that it's a movement, regenerative farming.  
**[0:58:41-0:58:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:58:41):**  It's not a marketing buzzword.  
**[0:58:42-0:58:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:58:42):**  It's a full movement.  
**[0:58:43-0:58:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:58:43):**  But a movement needs to come from grassroots.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:58:46):**  It needs to come from people that are going to truly want to change people's minds and  
**[0:58:51-0:58:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:58:51):**  where their hearts, their energy, and where they put their time, and then ultimately their  
**[0:58:54-0:58:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:58:54):**  money.  
**[0:58:57-0:58:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:58:57):**  I do believe it can change.  
**[0:58:59-0:59:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:58:59):**  I do believe it's worth the investment in more recyclable packaging.  
**[0:59:03-0:59:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:59:03):**  The add-ons into products that children really learn how to engage with food and live a healthier  
**[0:59:09-0:59:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:59:09):**  lifestyle and make good food choices.  
**[0:59:13-0:59:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:59:13):**  And I do think we're pretty rare in the industry, not just here in Germany, but kind of anywhere  
**[0:59:18-0:59:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:59:18):**  that we truly think that we can impact children's health holistically and with longer term impacts,  
**[0:59:24-0:59:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:59:24):**  starting with baby food.  
**[0:59:25-0:59:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:59:25):**  This is a good way to end.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:59:27):**  But I still have one more question I would like to ask.  
**[0:59:30-0:59:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:59:30):**  What about biodynamic?  
**[0:59:31-0:59:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:59:31):**  We had White Leaf Provisions, which is a US brand that mostly sources all of their ingredients  
**[0:59:37-0:59:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:59:37):**  in Europe.  
**[0:59:39-0:59:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:59:39):**  I mean, biodynamic is sort of a step beyond organic, fully certified, which makes it very  
**[0:59:46-0:59:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:59:46):**  interesting compared to, let's say, the larger regenerative umbrella, where there's a lot  
**[0:59:51-0:59:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:59:51):**  of discussion and there should be a lot of discussion.  
**[0:59:54-0:59:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:59:54):**  Let's not define it just yet.  
**[0:59:57-0:59:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:59:57):**  Are there any ingredients you source like that?  
**[0:59:59-1:00:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:59:59):**  Is that cost prohibitive?  
**[1:00:01-1:00:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:00:01):**  What's the reasoning behind not being fully biodynamic, for instance?  
**[1:00:07-1:00:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:00:07):**  There is a market also for that.  
**[1:00:08-1:00:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:00:08):**  Yeah, there is definitely.  
**[1:00:09-1:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:00:09):**  Many of our ingredients are, but unless you have everything on it, you cannot call your  
**[1:00:14-1:00:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:00:14):**  product biodynamic.  
**[1:00:15-1:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:00:15):**  Right.  
**[1:00:16-1:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:00:16):**  Otherwise we have more marketing washing and health washing, which we will never do.  
**[1:00:22-1:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:00:22):**  So there's just not enough yet on it to be, I think, interesting enough where I would  
**[1:00:28-1:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:00:28):**  look to sacrifice taste development or diversity in ingredients, like the large amount of ingredients  
**[1:00:34-1:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:00:34):**  that we put in our products and taste from sour to bitter, et cetera.  
**[1:00:39-1:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:00:39):**  But yes, it is one of the next easy steps to do.  
**[1:00:44-1:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:00:44):**  It's not cost prohibitive.  
**[1:00:46-1:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:00:46):**  It's marginally, it's just like organic in the cost structure.  
**[1:00:50-1:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:00:50):**  It's just there's not everything available yet.  
**[1:00:52-1:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:00:52):**  And also we don't have a certification regulation yet, born on it.  
**[1:00:57-1:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:00:57):**  So of course we have Demita and things like this, but it's also not black and white.  
**[1:01:02-1:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:01:02):**  There's products that have that label on them that aren't even fully Demita.  
**[1:01:06-1:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:01:06):**  So again, it's confusing to the customer and producers.  
**[1:01:10-1:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:01:10):**  So clarity, transparency, traceability, as soon as we make all of these things so much  
**[1:01:16-1:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:01:16):**  more mandatory, I think things like biodiversity will just be one of the net winners.  
**[1:01:22-1:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:01:22):**  And it's a winner to everybody right now because it's just the next step.  
**[1:01:25-1:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:01:25):**  Perfect.  
**[1:01:26-1:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:01:26):**  Yeah, we had an interview, depending a bit on the production schedule, it will be out  
**[1:01:30-1:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:01:30):**  already and otherwise we'll link it later with activist and model Arizona Muse on Biodynamic  
**[1:01:36-1:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:01:36):**  on the fibers, obviously, because she comes from the fashion industry.  
**[1:01:40-1:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:01:40):**  She is in the fashion industry, but definitely also on the food aspects, which was absolutely  
**[1:01:43-1:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:01:43):**  fascinating.

**[1:01:59-1:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:01:59):**  And I don't think it's the last time we chat about the importance of the first thousand  
**[1:02:03-1:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:02:03):**  and then all the other thousand days that follow up.  
**[1:02:05-1:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:02:05):**  Yeah, and the next, and the next.  
**[1:02:07-1:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:02:07):**  Thank you so much for having us.  
**[1:02:09-1:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:02:09):**  It means a lot that you also let us have another ability to get the message out and really  
**[1:02:15-1:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:02:15):**  start fighting for kids' nutrition.  
**[1:02:17-1:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:02:17):**  So thank you.  
**[1:02:18-1:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:02:18):**  Yeah.  
**[1:02:19-1:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:02:19):**  If you remember one thing, vegetables, not fruit.  
**[1:02:20-1:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:02:20):**  I just keep repeating.  
**[1:02:21-1:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:02:21):**  I'll put it as an undertone in all the future interviews.  
**[1:02:25-1:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:02:25):**  Don't forget vegetables, not fruit.  
**[1:02:27-1:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:02:27):**  Anyway, see you at the next one.

**[1:03:18-1:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:03:18):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[1:03:22-1:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:03:22):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[1:03:26-1:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:03:26):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[1:03:28-1:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:03:28):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question,  
**[1:03:32-1:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:03:32):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been following the space since 2011  
**[1:03:37-1:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:03:37):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[1:03:42-1:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:03:42):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[1:03:44-1:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:03:44):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  
**[1:03:47-1:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:03:47):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[1:03:49-1:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:03:49):**  How have we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask?  
**[1:03:53-1:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:03:53):**  What is happening in the space?  
**[1:03:54-1:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:03:54):**  What should you read?  
**[1:03:55-1:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:03:55):**  What should you listen?  
**[1:03:57-1:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:03:57):**  What should you watch?

**[1:04:00-1:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:04:00):**  For whom is this course?  
**[1:04:02-1:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:04:02):**  You the soil builders and investors in this space, the soil builders, people working in  
**[1:04:06-1:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:04:06):**  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing,  
**[1:04:12-1:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:04:12):**  platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line  
**[1:04:16-1:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:04:16):**  designers, holistic management, consultants, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[1:04:19-1:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:04:19):**  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  
**[1:04:23-1:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:04:23):**  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  
**[1:04:28-1:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:04:28):**  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies,

**[1:04:35-1:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:04:35):**  Is this course free?  
**[1:04:36-1:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:04:36):**  No, this is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[1:04:39-1:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:04:39):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[1:04:42-1:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:04:42):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[1:04:47-1:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:04:47):**  different means.  
**[1:04:48-1:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:04:48):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[1:04:53-1:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:04:53):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[1:04:56-1:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:04:56):**  Thank you.  
**[1:04:57-1:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:04:57):**  So what is this course?  
**[1:04:58-1:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:04:58):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[1:05:05-1:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:05:05):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[1:05:07-1:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:05:07):**  We're going to look into why investing regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[1:05:12-1:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:05:12):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[1:05:17-1:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:05:17):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[1:05:22-1:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:05:22):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[1:05:24-1:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:05:24):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[1:05:28-1:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:05:28):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[1:05:32-1:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:05:32):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  
**[1:05:37-1:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:05:37):**  So what is it not?  
**[1:05:38-1:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:05:38):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:05:40-1:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:05:40):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:05:43-1:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:05:43):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:05:46-1:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:05:46):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:05:48-1:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:05:48):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[1:05:53-1:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:05:53):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking, click on

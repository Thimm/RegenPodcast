### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2022-06-28)  
### Author(s): Koen van Seijen  

**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com slash course or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:00:13):**  The success and health of our society starts in the pregnant belly.  So why are we feeding children so badly and mothers as well?  The shocking reality of baby food, even in the premium organic house, over 90% of the  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:00:26):**  food you find is fruit puree, apple, pear and banana.  Of course, organic, but still sugar nonetheless.  And there's no scientific backing for that at all.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:00:35):**  The first foods of baby shouldn't be fruit at all, but should be vegetables.  Things that are bitter, maybe a bit acidic.  Of course, they might not love it immediately, but they need to be exposed to it, to learn  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:00:46):**  how to eat it later and to become the non picky eaters we all need and to become healthy.  This is an episode where we dive deep into baby nutrition and the first thousand days  and why the current baby food industry really, really needs a shakeup.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:01:02):**  This is the investing in regenerative agriculture and food podcast investing as if the planet  mattered.  Where we talk to the pioneers in regenerative food and agriculture space to learn more on  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:01:15):**  how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities and ecosystems  while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:01:26):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:01:38):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  To make it easy for fans to support our work, we launched our membership community and so  many of you have joined us as a member.

**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:02:15):**  and we're going to dive deep into baby food and what's the role of nutrition there, science,  a lot of folklore, I think, and why and how it's such a pivotal moment for many people  in terms of food, in terms of nutrition, in terms of food choices as well.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:02:31):**  So I'm very, very happy to unpack that and a lot more today.  Welcome Jacqueline.  Thank you.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:02:37):**  It's such a great pleasure to be here.  And to start with that personal question we always like to throw at people first.  How did you end up working on and co-founding a baby food company?  
**[0:02:48-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:02:48):**  Yeah, I get this question all the time.  People just assumed I have a baby or I had a baby and oh, I didn't like what was in the  market.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:02:56):**  But that's not it at all.  I think many people do that and then they don't start a baby food company.  Otherwise we would have millions and millions of baby food companies.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:04):**  I mean, many people maybe sort of start a baby food company in the kitchen for a while  and then transition to two other things in a very small scale.  In this case, there's a different story behind it.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:14):**  Yeah, so I've been in the food industry, the commercial food industry almost my entire  professional life.  And I was so excited.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:22):**  Sorry, but you're still in the commercial food industry.  Yeah, true.  It's interesting when people say that the intensive, I say, yeah, you can do intensive  
**[0:03:29-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:29):**  differently.  I hope this is commercial.  Otherwise we will be talking to a nonprofit, which is also fine, but that was not the intention.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:35):**  It's very interesting how we framed that.  Yeah.  Okay.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:39):**  So the commercial food industry are these big guys that are driven by lobbyists and  driven by Wall Street expectations that actually are not driven by purpose or fancy marketing  claims or that have gigantic research and consumer insight budgets that are actually  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:03:54):**  doing this with their own purpose and passion and funding.  And also really, I've got almost all of my friends and family invested in pumpkin.  So if I don't make this work, I'm going to have a very lonely Christmas dinner coming  
**[0:04:09-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:04:09):**  up.  At least we have a lot of food.  Yeah, true.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:04:12):**  At least we will have a lot of food.  You know, the reality is I really entered the big food company with a vision that I  was going to change nutrition, that I was going to change and have an impact on the  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:04:24):**  way we grow food, the way we serve food, the way food integrates into family.  And that's not how it works.  I was so amazed.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:04:34):**  It works by what your manager, manager, manager, manager says from plans one to two years ago.  It's driven by, like in the US where I started by lobbyists and Wall Street.  We were incentivized by cutting out real aspects of nutrition because the customer didn't  
**[0:04:53-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:04:53):**  maybe value it so we could put something cheaper in or do it a more economical way.  Do you have an example of that?  Like just a shocking one or just the one or the first one that triggered like, whoa, we  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:05:07):**  switched this for this and just from a nutrition or taste perspective, it doesn't make any  sense.  I had a couple trigger moments in my few years of the story that made me say, okay, I'm in  
**[0:05:18-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:05:18):**  this, but I'm going to make massive change or I have to switch because it's against every  fundamental value.  And one was a very standard boxed meal product in the US where the middle class, it was,  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:05:29):**  it's a billion dollar brand and it had real cheese powder in it.  One of the only real components of nutrition in it.  And they did consumer testing and they realized that it was the taste of the cheese.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:05:41):**  It wasn't the nutrition of the cheese.  So they took the real cheese out and put a synthetic flavoring in.  So basically it was about shipping air in a box that had a-  
**[0:05:51-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:05:51):**  Worse than air.  Yeah, worse than air.  Okay.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:05:54):**  And this was, the person was put on a stage and celebrated at our annual meeting that  they truly understood consumer insight and they drove massive cost savings to the company,  which were both true.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:06:09):**  Absolutely true.  But I had a feeling in my stomach and more importantly, like my brain-  Literally, yeah.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:06:16):**  Yeah.  Like this is not what science says.  Science is so clear on how nutrition can work.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:06:23):**  And not only that, we see it with increasing lifestyle diseases, like the top health issues  in almost every society in the world are man or people caused, we cause them.  So you cannot tell me that this is not, that there's no connection to what the food industry  
**[0:06:42-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:06:42):**  offers.  And that was the first trigger.  So that's-  
**[0:06:46-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:06:46):**  And then why and how, I mean, I understand the why really well, but what was the trigger  to start focusing on that first 1000 days or that the first baby said, because you clearly  mentioned the beginning.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:07:00):**  It wasn't because we were in the kitchen trying to figure out what to feed our child and no,  there was a, there's a more rational, and it's also very rational actually, but a different  why, why you started, started with this.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:07:12):**  And of course your plans are much bigger than, than the first, let's say period we are eating  a food that is not like potentially breast milk or, or milk in general.  Why, why did you focus on that first 1000 days?  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:07:26):**  Is that science driven again?  Is that what, what insight came there?  Absolutely.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:07:31):**  So I come from the middle of Canada in Saskatchewan, which is one of the biggest farmlands in the  world.  My father is a chemistry professor fully dedicated to the farm industry.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:07:41):**  And so I grew up before, you know, just learning to walk and talk, but also learning how about  the chemistry of food and soil and growing.  So I knew there was a better way to do things.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:07:53):**  I didn't know where this knowledge would come into my life or, or where I would need it  later on.  But growing up with, you know, the excitement of seeing your tomato plant grow because you  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:03):**  put eggshells that you had kept all year and then made this, you know, calcium phosphorus  distillation or we put Coke on the one beside it.  So we like studied the impact of sugar on just life, let alone growth.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:17):**  As a young child, I had this inside of me that there was something wrong with sugar.  You were doing these experiments basically in your back garden with your father.  Our garden was a lab.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:26):**  The lab, it was amazing.  Wow, side by side experiments.  What was a shocking one?  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:31):**  I mean, sugar for, for tomato sounds interesting, but like you became, basically you make ketchup.  What was that?  Completely, yes.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:38):**  But the, it was really the impact of sugar.  And of course my father knew all of this, right?  He's a chemistry professor focused on all of this.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:45):**  And for me, it was fascinating to see this innocent little white powder that is in everything.  And okay, I'm 43.  So take back a few years.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:08:55):**  Nobody questioned putting sugar on everything.  Nobody questioned anything on proper nutrition at this time.  Which was very interesting, interestingly framed back in the day.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:05):**  If you go back, if you want to go into the conspiracy rabbit hole, like the whole fat  versus sugar and how sugar became the issue and not fat with some very interesting lobbying.  I'm laughing about it, but actually it's horrible.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:17):**  Very interesting lobbying from certain industries.  And now we're starting to see sugar is driving a lot of this.  It's sugar.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:26):**  It's not fat.  It's sugar.  It's not fat.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:29):**  Which is very, I mean, you saw already that even on like adding sugar to soil, fascinating.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:35):**  It changed its structure because even the soil changed its molecular structure.  It changed its pH level.  It changed its viscosity level.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:43):**  Again, as a young child, you don't know what all of this means, but you saw the change.  And I think that's the important part also that you see it and you can be part of it.  And you tasted it.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:54):**  Very, very young.  Yes.  Obviously.  
**[0:09:57-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:09:57):**  Oh my gosh.  Yeah.  And that was the other thing.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:00):**  We put it on carrots and it made no taste.  And actually the carrots didn't grow as big.  So it's like the tomatoes collapsed when we put the Coke on it.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:06):**  But when we had our carrot row and one row, instead of just digging the seeds, we put  little sugar cubes in the bottom.  They didn't grow as much.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:14):**  They were smaller.  Now, I don't know any cause and effect on this, but as a child, these are the images  that stayed with me for a lot.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:21):**  Of course.  And even now drive a lot of the choices I make on how we look at the food company.  And then how did you end up finding a baby food company in Germany?  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:33):**  Because you're the middle from farmland in Canada.  That's literally culturally distance wise, pretty far.  Yeah.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:41):**  That's the other side of the world.  But I met my husband doing my, we did our MBAs at Harvard together and he's German.  And after business school, we moved to Europe and then we wanted to settle either Canada  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:10:53):**  or Germany and Munich came up.  And I just think the city is amazing and beautiful and really based on an outside way of living.  So I said, yeah, let's go for it.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:11:04):**  And we love the choice.  And this is really one of the fundamental beginnings of pumpkin.  I was working here and just feeling extremely down, no energy for years.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:11:19):**  I went to numerous doctors, like from TCM to, you know, Ayurvedic to traditional and  nobody could solve what was happening.  And this is one of the most frustrating aspects is people don't take general aches and pains  
**[0:11:35-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:11:35):**  in the body seriously.  They just think, oh, you're too stressed.  You're working too hard, blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:11:41):**  Every excuse under the sun.  Anyways, after a couple of years, I was finally correctly diagnosed with Hashimoto's.  And this, I left my job and I put the entire rigor and my passion for everything into solve  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:11:55):**  Hashimoto's or an autoimmune condition with food.  You can't stop autoimmune, but you can slow it down and you can change the trajectory  of your, you know, how it's going to work in your body.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:12:06):**  And this is where I started.  One of the benefits of having a network like the Harvard network, as I called some of the  most amazing doctors in the world.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:12:16):**  And I gave them these challenges.  I want to solve this with food.  And food means also how do we grow the food?  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:12:22):**  How do I get the right nutrients out of the food?  Because one of the biggest issues of our society is we eat food with a quarter of the nutritional  value that our parents and grandparents.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:12:32):**  If this sounds shocking to you, go and Google.  There's some very interesting research recently and not so recent actually, but there seems  to be a wave now around this and just a small spoiler alert.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:12:43):**  We're going to do a series on nutrient density and the connection to soil health and management.  And I'll put a paper in the show notes below of David Montgomery and his wife, Anne, who  will hopefully have on the show soon as well that really connected, but there's so much  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:13:00):**  more research connecting what we do to the soil and what happens to our body once we  eat what came out of that soil, basically.  Completely.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:13:09):**  And so I started really studying this and then working with the head of the nuclear  medical clinic here in Munich.  He doesn't have a lot of belief in nutrition, but he cannot believe the change I made.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:13:22):**  And so we've been working together for years now.  And so many people just said, Jacqueline, you've got to put this knowledge and passion  into a company now.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:13:32):**  And I said, okay, but I'm going to find a way that I can really make an impact because  at this stage in my life, it's not about a paycheck.  It's not about building my CV.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:13:39):**  It's about actually producing a legacy of change.  What made you change there or not change, but sort of the logical steps seems or seems  looking back at targeting that autoimmune disease or targeting helping others with the  
**[0:13:53-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:13:53):**  same to go through that process, etc, etc.  But you said no, or maybe yes as well, but the company is going to be focusing on baby  food or on the first thousand days.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:14:04):**  Because when you want to tackle a problem, you go to the beginning and the beginning  is the baby.  And I didn't know there was a problem with baby food.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:14:12):**  We didn't have a child at this point.  I wasn't focused on this industry.  I knew the big...  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:14:18):**  You heard your friends complaining about it, but it's sort of one ear in, one ear out.  People complain about everything.  So it wasn't like the trigger wasn't there.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:14:27):**  And I went and I thought, okay, easiest from the beginning.  I went to the shelf of a big retailer here.  And I literally had tears in my eyes.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:14:38):**  When I saw what was on the shelf, I could not believe that this was the offering in  one of the wealthiest, most educated, resource rich, any positive adjective you can give  countries in the world.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:14:56):**  And we were giving children 200 jars, 200 pouches where 85% of the contents were apple,  pear, and banana, a pureed fruit.  And there is nothing in science that says this is the right way to start children's  
**[0:15:12-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:12):**  nutrition.  And if there is, this doctor should be fired because he has no idea about nutrition.  It's really shocking.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:19):**  Yeah.  It's really shocking.  If you have children, I mean, you've looked at this for sure.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:24):**  If you're listening to this, if you don't, just next time you're in a supermarket or  in any shop that sells, just look at the ingredients.  Your job will be on the floor.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:34):**  I promise you.  Okay.  So you saw that and were like, whoa.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:37):**  Yeah.  And I just said, this is it.  This is now my life's mission.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:41):**  I'm going to change the trajectory of children's health by changing the children's food industry.  And so why is that, that it's filled with those three ingredients are mainly apple,  honestly, and banana.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:15:52):**  And it's the same, what we discussed previously, the let's replace it with something sweet  or let's replace it with the cheapest, in some cases, organic ingredient, but still  doesn't mean maybe the first thing they should eat.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:16:06):**  It's not the first thing they should eat.  There are apple, smashed apples.  And so what does the science say there actually?  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:16:14):**  What are the first things we all, when we get to food should start nibbling on or should  start tasting?  You know, I'm not a vegetarian, but every child should start on vegetables.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:16:27):**  There is not a child can definitely have fruit.  Okay.  Don't get me wrong.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:16:33):**  But if you are going to eat fruit, the fructose in that fruit, if you don't have the fiber  from the whole food, it goes completely into the body as glucose.  And it's not used as energy, it's stored in the body.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:16:43):**  So that's one aspect.  The second aspect is our brains are formed in this first thousand days.  80% of the brain is formed.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:16:52):**  So just think about how quickly a child, like when you had your little one and our little  one, like how quickly they learn to walk and talk and play and replicate everything you  do.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:17:02):**  The learning curves are vertical.  And it's the same with food.  And the food is even worse because there is a chemical reaction in the body, in the brain,  
**[0:17:12-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:17:12):**  that when you put that pureed fruit in and sweetness, the brain says, oh, wow, yum, I  want more of this.  I'm going to crave more of it.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:17:20):**  I'm going to reject the bitter or the sour aspects of food, which you need to develop  the taste palette on.  I want this fruit or this bland flavoring.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:17:30):**  And so not only is it not providing the proper nutrition and giving way too much sugar into  these tiny bodies, but it is actually training unhealthy eating habits that the child then  will develop further and further.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:17:44):**  So this sugary, like trigger that we all notice is where as adults, etc, is formed or already  starts when you're super, super small.  And we need to expose small ones at all the different flavors they are, which many are  
**[0:17:59-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:17:59):**  bitter and many are acidic and many are sour and many are, and we need to, and you're saying  this first year, I've even read first few months when you start eating also the allergy  discussions on nuts, expose, expose, expose, expose to all the different ones and not go  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:18:15):**  for fruity, sugary, etc.  And so that dependency.  So what is the alternative there?  
**[0:18:25-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:18:25):**  Like you started a company, like you just blend all the vegetables.  Like how do we make sure we grow children into healthy eaters?  Like what's that crucial?  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:18:37):**  Is that the full diversity just like in soil?  Is it the exposure to things?  Is it the playing with it as well in a sense like it should be not a war, but a pleasure?  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:18:46):**  No, but you got to be ready for a battle.  I mean, evolution of our brains is that when we taste bitter or sour, we think it's poison.  That's the evolution of humanity with taste.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:18:58):**  So you cannot eliminate completely that the baby doesn't understand bitter or sour, but  it can be trained like everything we do.  And even here in Germany, the Midwife Association even says a new taste, a new food takes 8  
**[0:19:13-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:13):**  to 10 to 12 times to be introduced.  So keep going, don't give up.  Don't give up.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:19):**  Right.  It's the same thing.  Like if you go outside with a football and your child doesn't shoot a perfect 50-yard  
**[0:19:25-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:25):**  goal when they're two, you don't give up on sports.  You're going to play tennis, right?  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:31):**  Right.  But it's the same thing.  We have so much acceptance and patience in almost every aspect of learning, except when  
**[0:19:37-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:37):**  it comes to nutrition.  We give up so easy.  And one of the main drivers of that is that parents actually have very poor eating habits  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:46):**  or lack of knowledge themselves.  Let's go there.  Now, I mean, we had to go there obviously.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:52):**  So what, I mean, you have the baby food lines.  Now let's first unpack a bit.  What is pumpkin organics at the moment?  
**[0:19:59-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:19:59):**  And then we're going to talk about the two directions you can take it, obviously, like  as the child gets older, but also before, because you say, we want to go to the beginning,  which is obviously not the moment at four and a half or four months or five months,  
**[0:20:10-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:20:10):**  depending on where they are, when they start eating, like it's earlier as well.  So let's first say, okay, in a few sentences or a few more, currently we're in the late  spring of 2022, what is pumpkin organics and how would you describe it if you have to,  
**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:20:24):**  I wouldn't say pitch it, but if you have to present it, what do you, because you cannot  see it, but behind Jacqueline, there's a lot of food laid out, but obviously it is an audio  podcast and we don't do video.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:20:35):**  So it's described to us what pumpkin organics is, where do you sell, who can get it, who  can't unfortunately.  Absolutely.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:20:41):**  So pumpkin organics, it's a food, it's basically, we want to be the leader in sustainable nutrition.  We want to teach children with our food, primarily through snacks and through solution-based  food offerings for parents, that there is a way to help your children fall in love with  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:21:01):**  vegetables, to reduce their dependency on sugar, to teach them how to make good food  choices and do it with a lot of just incredibly yummy tasting food.  So of course our products are all organic.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:21:14):**  We are actually the first baby food globally to be certified climate neutral.  We are only one of the three companies in Europe that have recyclable pouches.  So we really do prioritize the entire aspect of the food.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:21:31):**  Due to the limitations of the industry or the certification regulation processes and  the complexity, there's still a lot we can't do.  And so we also offer a lot of recipes and our voice of advice, like we're not doctors,  
**[0:21:45-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:21:45):**  we're not nutritionists.  We are well educated, incredibly passionate people that want to help parents teach their  children to make healthy, lifelong food decisions.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:21:57):**  And so you're selling online, you're selling in a number of stores, mostly in the, say  the German speaking region of Europe at the moment.  And of course, with plans to go beyond that.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:22:08):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're primarily in, like you said, in the German speaking region and most retailers  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:22:13):**  in the organic stores as well.  We're a quite large online store, which is fantastic because it allows us to directly  connect with parents and we have wonderful discussions with them on the challenges they  
**[0:22:28-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:22:28):**  have.  And yeah, it really feels in the last, I don't know, half a year, more and more people are  starting to value nutrition.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:22:41):**  And we really see a growth of the base and of more and more people willing to try what  the child might not instantly like on phase one, which is a fruit poach.  But actually dig into the complexity of building their diet based off of plants led by vegetables.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:23:00):**  Now, I suddenly remember when our daughter, which she never had actually normally, like  fruit poaches and she finished one in one shot because of course it's like instant gratification  and it's like, whoa, this is interesting.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:23:14):**  This is not what I normally get.  And it's very interesting.  Anyway, so what you mentioned, you highlighted something very interesting or you sort of  
**[0:23:24-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:23:24):**  mentioned it.  There are a lot of things we cannot do yet or we cannot do in terms of regulation.  And also because it's not that you have your own gigantic factory doing all of this, which  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:23:33):**  means you have fully control over where ingredients come from, etc.  So describe the current situation between brackets and what you would like to do because  I'm imagining you would like to go beyond organic and start sourcing from the places  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:23:46):**  where because we all know, I mean, organic certification is amazing, but there's a whole  world beyond that.  And it's a relatively low bar.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:23:54):**  So what's the current situation and what would you love to do in the near future?  So the current situation is the demand for baby food is significant and it's growing  driven by complexity with just knowledge and what do I feed my child?  
**[0:24:14-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:24:14):**  More women are going back to work earlier.  So there is a higher reliance on commercial food, things like that.  There's a lot of dynamics in the market that have created a quite large demand on the market.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:24:27):**  The regulation, the certification hasn't evolved too drastically over the years.  So the fact that the core recipes that are on the shelves are the same ones that are  from 10, 15 years ago, it might be a new brand, it might be new packaging, but the core concept  
**[0:24:45-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:24:45):**  of the food hasn't evolved is one of my biggest areas that I really want to fight for.  And also the core decision makers that are leaning the certification, the regulations  of the food is the big companies, the big brands, the big agencies.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:25:05):**  And we need to get some new blood in there.  We need to get some new thought.  We need to get some people that actually truly want to drive the industry based on the science,  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:25:13):**  not based on cheap ingredients, accessibility of those ingredients, or what the baby is  just saying, oh, I want more sugar.  What's going to sell on the shelf?  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:25:22):**  Like you said, your daughter just slurped up a pouch.  Something that's really important with our pouches is they're thick.  So when the child actually takes the product into their mouth, they can't swallow it right  
**[0:25:36-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:25:36):**  away.  They actually have to maneuver it within the mouth.  They have to produce the saliva, which aids in the digestion and also which helps when  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:25:42):**  it gets into the gut with the bacteria.  Also we started the company with a little spoon attachment to the pouch.  So you can engage with the child.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:25:52):**  You can feed the child right away.  So there's a lot of aspects of the industry that I was able to change just by my product  offering.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:26:03):**  But it's been a very, very uphill battle because there was no category for our products at  the beginning.  And we're only talking five years ago.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:26:11):**  We're not talking 20 years ago.  There was no vegetable category on the shelf.  Everybody laughed at us when I told them what I wanted to do.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:26:21):**  They said, this will never sell.  You're competing against mega incumbents, especially in Germany with the price point  so low, what it is on the shelf, I can't even produce for.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:26:32):**  Yeah.  Because it's those cheap ingredients that are.  But it is selling.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:26:38):**  Tons of things are buying, coming back and because they see, imagine they see the results.  And so, but you are not able yet to select your farms, for instance, or to select, like  go down all the way down to, okay, I want this tomato row and not that one where they  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:26:54):**  put organic coconut.  No, because the complexity of how organic food for babies is still farmed and certified  is very, very closed.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:27:06):**  So there are certain farms, of course, like a certified baby organic broccoli is different  than an organic broccoli, different from a broccoli, etc.  It's like completely a different category basically in terms of certification.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:27:18):**  Exactly.  Yeah.  Because of the contaminant levels in the products and also what is allowed with fertilizers,  
**[0:27:25-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:27:25):**  etc.  Which is a good thing.  But it means it's very difficult to disrupt.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:27:30):**  It's not that you say, oh, let's use that broccoli.  No, it's not from that certified farm and that certified field.  And especially for a company like us that wanted to use a lot of ingredients that were  
**[0:27:40-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:27:40):**  beyond the core five fruits and vegetables.  And nobody was certified basically.  It was a nightmare to find certified red beets, for example, or quinoa, things like this within  
**[0:27:52-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:27:52):**  a acceptable travel distance to our plants.  We have nothing coming from far, far away with the exception of the banana because they  have all baby bananas come from Ecuador in Germany.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:03):**  We can't grow them here or in Italy or something.  And so if you would grow, what would you need to do?  Would you need to be double the size?  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:12):**  Is it in reach to start controlling more of that process?  Do you need to be 10 times as much or do you say, okay, that's something that's a distant  dream to be in full control?  
**[0:28:22-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:22):**  It needs to be the whole industry.  The industry has to come together and say, enough is enough.  We're going to grow proper ingredients and we're going to actually regulate the industry  
**[0:28:31-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:31):**  that we take away all full fruit pouches.  There is no need for them in the market at all.  We do not need anything with added sugar or juice or concentrate.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:40):**  There is not a single scientific benefit or health benefit to it.  And we just have to actually put proper regulation in for what is acceptable baby food in that  first thousand days.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:51):**  It should be all the way through our lifespan.  Of course.  We're going to talk about that.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:28:56):**  There's no way like this whole discussion now on soil health and the connection to the  nutrient density or the quality of the produce.  Are you going to introduce or try or that's impossible to say, okay, we know this farm  
**[0:29:12-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:29:12):**  near Munich that's doing amazing broccoli, for instance.  And somehow we're going to try to as a little wedge to wedge it into our supply chain.  We try, definitely.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:29:21):**  And we work with our plants as much as we can on it.  Do they like it?  Are they interested in that kind of, or are you just a small and a bit annoying customer  
**[0:29:32-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:29:32):**  sometimes?  So we're definitely probably that small little annoying child that's always tugging at your  –  
**[0:29:39-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:29:39):**  But why?  But why?  Exactly.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:29:42):**  But the thing is the plants and the R&D teams at the plants are amazing.  They want to do more work like we do.  But many of the incumbent brands and the customer base still isn't demanding it.  
**[0:29:54-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:29:54):**  So if you're a few percent of their customers, you're sort of the activist shareholder.  But if you, I mean, you're still putting something on the agenda.  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:30:05):**  And we are making change because we are the first people doing a lot of these formulas.  And then you start to see them cropping up other places, which is wonderful.  So this is like, even though we're one of the smallest brands, probably within the brand,  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:30:20):**  and not just the starting brand, we do have a loud voice and we do have a seat at the  table at most of our plants, which is really fantastic.  We get above our, I would say, share of resources in development and looking at different techniques  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:30:39):**  and working with the farmers, packaging techniques, processing techniques, because we're trying  to change the industry and they see that.  So in that respect, we are making small inroads, but for mega change to happen in this industry,  
**[0:30:55-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:30:55):**  it has to come from the institutionalized bodies that change the regulation and or basically  the bigger brands coming together and say, no, we're done.  We're not going to do that anymore because that is against what the science says for  
**[0:31:08-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:31:08):**  first nutrition.  And let's take it to one step.  And the demand for cheap food, now you're showing that there is demand for non-cheap  
**[0:31:17-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:31:17):**  food.  Of course, there's a discussion or like, okay, if your price point is higher, what about  accessibility?  
**[0:31:25-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:31:25):**  How do we tackle that?  Or do you see like our stuff is brought by people throughout, let's say, income levels,  et cetera, because people prioritize differently?  
**[0:31:36-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:31:36):**  Like, how do you see that?  Are you for the happy few?  I'm trying to ask, are you across the board for people that are targeting better health  
**[0:31:45-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:31:45):**  for their children?  If I could, I mean, we are not making a higher margin on our product.  I do not believe access to health should be driven by your socioeconomic position or your  
**[0:31:57-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:31:57):**  postcode at all.  I think this should be actually part of the government's platforms, first nutrition, that  every child gets an equal start, both from an education and a product access point of  
**[0:32:09-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:32:09):**  view.  So what we've actually tried to do is, of course, we sell our product at the normal  product price, which is about 20% above the market.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:32:21):**  But that's a big amount in some markets.  Especially if you see it next to each other.  That's the problem always, because it's really on the shelf.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:32:31):**  It's just really framing wise.  You might buy, I don't know, you spend it so much easier on electronics and things like  that.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:32:40):**  But if you're standing in that show, you're thinking like, oh, 20%.  Like one euro items, right?  I know.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:32:46):**  People make choices based on 10, 15 cents, but yet you go and buy the iPhone 12, I don't  know what number we're on 15, 16 now.  You know, we're not even thinking twice about it.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:32:58):**  And so this is what I mean, where, you know, if we, when you asked about what we could  change, one of the single biggest things is education.  Because if people actually knew really what they were doing to their bodies, I think it  
**[0:33:10-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:10):**  would change that 15, 20 cents decision.  And any person who is going to the market on the weekend or any day, you see the price  of an organic broccoli, of an organic sweet potato.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:22):**  We can't do it for the price of an apple.  We just can't.  It's impossible.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:27):**  And so even just the ingredient amount that we spent, the rest of the production costs  are relatively the same.  Packaging is the same.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:34):**  We all have the same packaging or relative, you know.  It's ingredients.  Is that what you would change if you had one?  
**[0:33:41-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:41):**  I'm bringing the magic wand question in already.  Like what would you change overnight if you had that power?  Would it be education or like good nutrition, science-based nutrition, education for all?  
**[0:33:53-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:33:53):**  Yeah, I would.  It would be the, it's the root of the absolute needed change in society.  People don't inherently wake up one morning and say, oh, I'm going to feed my child bad  
**[0:34:03-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:34:03):**  today or I'm not, it's okay if my child gets a lifestyle disease later on because I didn't  treat them well when they were a baby.  No parent does that.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:34:14):**  Everyone wakes up.  I want the best for my child.  I want to give them the best that I can do, that I know about, that I have access and  
**[0:34:20-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:34:20):**  that I can afford.  Right?  You're not that literal, but that's your mentality as a mom and as a dad or whoever the caregiver  
**[0:34:26-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:34:26):**  is.  But it's not what we offer.  It's not what society offers.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:34:33):**  There's so much marketing washing, green washing, health washing on products that if you don't  have a medical degree, a chemistry degree, a scientific research background, it's really  unfair to put these labels in front of you, to put these products on the shelf when it's  
**[0:34:51-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:34:51):**  85, 90, 95% of the shelf at trusted retailers by trusted brands, you trust it.  That's human nature.  That's what we have to do.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:35:00):**  We have no other choice.  So if we don't change the way we treat people and by respecting their intelligence and actually  educating them fairly, it's extremely difficult to blame them for making decisions that are  
**[0:35:17-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:35:17):**  maybe not a hundred percent optimal for their child's health.  And how do we take it even one step before?  Is it first nutrition?  
**[0:35:24-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:35:24):**  But of course it's not the first nutrition.  It's the first nutrition happens in the womb and then happens with breastfeeding or whatever  milk you end up using.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:35:34):**  So I know you're thinking about it.  There's nothing on the market yet.  Because the first thousand days I think includes the pregnancy.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:35:40):**  Yes, and it includes the belly.  In the UNICEF definition, that thousand days is the first three years including the nine  months and actually potentially even including the few months before.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:35:52):**  I'm just going to quote Jeremy Grantham, the founder of GMO, which is badly named, but  it's a value investor that wrote a paper.  Now he's the G of it.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:36:01):**  It's nothing to do with GMOs, but it was 50 years ago, I think they mentioned it.  But he wrote a paper on chemical toxicity in the baby bust, which I highly recommend.  He sent it always institutional investors.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:36:15):**  So all of this ended up in the boardrooms because he's such a respected investor of  pension funds, etc.  And he was talking about the baby bust and toxicity.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:36:25):**  And he said, for the immediate present, I do feel a moral imperative to urge anyone  pregnant to eat nothing but organic fruit and vegetables, let's say vegetables mostly,  for the duration and meant for six months prior.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:36:38):**  For more about this, please see the appendix.  I will link it below.  That period before or the start even, how would you approach that?  
**[0:36:47-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:36:47):**  Would that be in the future of the company?  Is that another company?  Is that like, what do you feel about that actually first nutrition even before the whole  
**[0:36:55-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:36:55):**  process starts?  It's vital.  I mean, the success and health of our society starts in the belly.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:37:00):**  There's no doubt.  And when you eat well, you feel well, right?  Because there's also so much, not just nutritional science, but mental well-being science in  
**[0:37:10-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:37:10):**  the pregnancy that if you are happy and smiling, your baby is going to come out happier and  more ready to adjust and learn.  And every single thing we do is a domino effect.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:37:22):**  So first nutrition absolutely starts with the mom.  I mean, or whoever, like the pregnant aspect of it and majority.  And we have to start educating women when they are in the school system, when they are  
**[0:37:39-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:37:39):**  in just products on the shelf.  When we start talking about any aspects of getting pregnant or being pregnant, there  is no nutrition knowledge you get from the standard midwife program in Germany, which  
**[0:37:53-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:37:53):**  is amazing.  Germany has this system where almost every mom gets a midwife to help them through the  process.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:37:58):**  None of them have nutrition or very, very few, I shouldn't say none.  There's probably some exceptions.  There is more instructions on your IKEA bookshelf than you get on nutrition when you're pregnant  
**[0:38:10-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:38:10):**  or when you go to the appointments for your doctor around six months, five, six months  to get a guide on how to feed your child.  It's absolutely – everyone is left alone.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:38:21):**  And when you're left alone and you have no idea what's happening in your body, what's  happening in the world around you, you are so anxious.  You find bits of knowledge that you grab onto.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:38:30):**  And this often comes from your parents, right?  Your mom or your grandma or your friends around you or completely random influencer strangers  that are more worried about their bikini body.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:38:42):**  Exactly.  During the pregnancy.  But this is where they get a lot of their nutrition knowledge from.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:38:47):**  This is so unfair to women.  You cannot – like you can't expect women just to wake up one morning and have this  nutrition halo above them telling their brain what decisions to make when we as an entire  
**[0:39:00-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:39:00):**  society do not actually put anything forth to help educate them.  So I would love to move our company forward to what we call the belly.  And it's actually one of the reasons that we are going to start the larger funding round  
**[0:39:15-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:39:15):**  now is we feel that we have a very, very big opportunity to help because we truly care.  It's not just about finding the next big product at the cheapest margin.  We truly really think we can have an impact on women's wellbeing driven by nutrition  
**[0:39:33-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:39:33):**  during the pregnancy phase.  And that seems really like a complete blue ocean.  I mean, there's – of course, you should take this vitamin and that.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:39:47):**  But that's pretty much it.  There's nothing on nutrition.  That's it.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:39:50):**  That's all you get.  There's also nothing on nutrition.  I've seen some complaints about other so little research on like breastfeeding versus  
**[0:39:58-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:39:58):**  not and things like that.  And there's one randomized control trial somewhere I think they did in Belarus.  But nobody asked the question like what were the women eating?  
**[0:40:06-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:40:06):**  Like what was feeding?  Because it's not politically sexy.  It's not that the breast milk comes out of thin air.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:40:13):**  You have to eat something to make and it's a very –  You have to eat a lot of nutritious food to produce a nut milk.  And that should be the focus there.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:40:22):**  And then we go one step forward.  So what would that look like if you have any of those?  Would that be specific like packages for pregnant women or like crucial ones also there?  
**[0:40:33-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:40:33):**  Because are there connections?  I would love to know if there's research like whatever the women were eating during pregnancy,  does that result in less picky eaters later?  
**[0:40:43-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:40:43):**  Because also there you're feeding the child obviously indirectly but very directly.  So there's definitely in the first thousand days research, some anecdotal studies from  the pregnancy side that if the mom ate a lot of cucumbers, the child loves cucumbers.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:40:59):**  If the child ate a lot of sugar or laddened food, the child comes out.  But honestly, this is beyond just that connection in the belly because if the mommy didn't eat  that well when the baby was in the belly, they're going to continue those eating patterns  
**[0:41:13-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:41:13):**  after.  And when you think of how much knowledge the child absorbs every day, they see that.  This is what they're going to be served.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:41:20):**  So there are not that many hardcore studies that have been lasted over generations yet  or peer reviewed to the nines on this topic because it is so sensitive in the number of  variables when a woman is pregnant.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:41:37):**  That for the research to truly be verified, I think would be extremely difficult.  Just to be sure, we know the direction.  I think there was David Lezak and Mandy Ellerton where we had them on the podcast, on a webinar  
**[0:41:52-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:41:52):**  actually and they researched this connection between their human health nexus and regenerative  agriculture.  So we'll never know all the details.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:41:59):**  We'll never know all the nuances and all the variables.  But the direction is very, very, very clear.  There is a strong connection between the two.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:42:05):**  So we better start acting because otherwise we're going to wait 20 years for all the peer  reviewed papers to come out and then we're too late.  We probably are a bit late already.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:42:12):**  Yeah.  When you look at the rising obesity rates, the rising rates that children don't actually  understand nutrition, we are at a critical turning point.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:42:24):**  But the reality is with regenerative aspects of farming, the point is we can make a change.  This is in our control and that's the wonderful thing about it.  It's not revolutionary.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:42:41):**  It's just small changes taking an evolutionary approach to lifestyle changes is going to  move the dial.  And I think-  
**[0:42:52-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:42:52):**  Yeah.  We're not lost.  We're not lost.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:42:55):**  And that's, I think, maybe one of the main rediscoveries, I would say, because obviously  for generations and generations in indigenous peoples, we knew this, but the fact that soil  can come back relatively quickly, depending how we treat it and the mirroring effect of  
**[0:43:10-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:43:10):**  the soil microbiome and our gut microbiome suggests that we can do similar steps in a  few years or a few months, or we've all heard these miracle stories, but it is at least  reversible to a certain extent.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:43:25):**  Obviously, we're not going to treat everything, please don't start writing about this, but  there's enormous steps to be taken and to be made in relatively like in geology time,  like in nothing, basically in a blimp in history, we can do a lot of things.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:43:40):**  So what would you tell smart investors?  Let's say we're in a theater full of finance people that are all dressed up.  Obviously, we're on stage, we're doing this, and then the question is, okay, what would  
**[0:43:55-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:43:55):**  we like to give them to them without obviously giving them investment advice, but what would  you like to tell them when they walk out of the theater?  What should they do the next day or the next morning or even evening itself, apart from  
**[0:44:06-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:44:06):**  feeding their children, if they haven't, very differently, but like what should they focus  their work energy on, their mental energy to spend their days on not just in the weekends  when they read the financial times, how to spend it.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:44:17):**  I want them to spend a week on this as well, their work life.  What should they dig deeper into?  What should they look for?  
**[0:44:25-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:44:25):**  Where should we guide them?  So this kind of feels like some of my daily discussions at times because a lot of investors  and a lot of capital is being put behind very marketing shiny companies that probably won't  
**[0:44:41-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:44:41):**  actually impact society positively in the next few months, years, or even decades.  It's probably a little bit further out to have that exponential or multiplying effect  on the health and happiness of society.  
**[0:44:56-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:44:56):**  So that would be the first thing is truly find companies that the change or the product  they're working on has an ability to impact in the short term because there's a lot of  money that are going behind big ideas.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:45:11):**  Like for example, the alternative meat investment just insane amounts.  It's crazy.  That's great, but why don't we just teach kids to eat proper plants now?  
**[0:45:25-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:45:25):**  Why do we need to have all these...  Okay, I'm not talking about like we need to find alternative proteins through insects  and all that.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:45:31):**  Absolutely.  Because there's just so many people coming, we have to feed them.  We have to make sure they get enough protein and B12 and folic acid, et cetera.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:45:38):**  But the amount of research that is behind making a hamburger look like it bleeds or  a plant-based hamburger in the way a regular hamburger does.  You could subsidize all children in Germany to eat better for the first thousand.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:45:49):**  Yeah.  I don't understand that.  Why can investors not actually see the impact of today?  
**[0:45:56-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:45:56):**  That we actually look at societal changes, behavioral changes, things that will impact  a huge society on mass.  Not that we can just afford the big celebrity investors to come and back products that may  
**[0:46:11-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:46:11):**  or may not actually change.  Then you have to be forced to really look at the Excel or look at the numbers and calculate  what could be done this year, next year.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:46:21):**  Not just because these numbers are always very interesting of the year, three or four,  the hockey stick starts to go up, let's say.  In many cases, it doesn't happen, but we like to believe in the dream of disrupting everything  
**[0:46:33-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:46:33):**  in a few years and forgetting that true disruption takes much longer.  Even the disruption stories we tell ourselves are usually 10, 15 years in the making, which  is still nothing on the large timescale of things.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:46:45):**  No, no.  But there's a huge amount of investment required behind what I always call non-sexy industries  or products that truly impact today's society.  
**[0:46:57-0:46:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:46:57):**  This would be the big thing.  I always try to ask if investors don't follow the herd, be an original thinker, be an original  backer, and back things that are truly important to society today that can make an impact today.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:47:13):**  Then back the big ideas, but know that that's your longer-term bet and bring some of the  funding into the nearer term.  It should be a barbell strategy.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:47:22):**  85%, as Nancy in the lab says, 85 in boring, non-sexy, but very important things, and 15  for the crazy wild moon shots with Google and things like that.  Could you imagine the impact on our society if we took 25% of our healthcare costs out  
**[0:47:38-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:47:38):**  of the system?  If we actually reduced sick days by 10, 15%, if we increased productivity by 20%.  These are metrics that we can control.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:47:50):**  For that, we don't need to invest billions and billions into meatless hamburgers.  We need to actually...  Or AI and robotics.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:47:58):**  Or AI, or I always say autonomous flying helicopters, which are super cool stuff.  But the impact is needed now where children and parents are making very, very big decisions.  What would you do if you were in charge of a billion dollar fund?  
**[0:48:15-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:48:15):**  Oh, gosh.  A billion euro.  Sorry, let's bring it to Europe.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:48:18):**  A billion euro fund, what would you focus on?  I'm starting to guess 850 million goes to non-sexy stuff.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:48:26):**  Right?  Really, two big things.  One is that every single mom, when they become pregnant all the way to first nutrition, there's  
**[0:48:34-0:48:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:48:34):**  a plan.  It's financially covered or at least subsidized.  That every single baby coming into this world and child has a fair start for their brain  
**[0:48:43-0:48:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:48:43):**  to be developed, their bodies to be developed, and that they can start in a healthy and happy  way, and really lead to a contributing members of society.  Much like in the Scandinavian countries, when you go home with the baby, you get this little  
**[0:48:55-0:49:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:48:55):**  box with a basic thing of diapers and some new clothes, and it's got a bed.  So basically, their point is that every single child in their first few months has a place  to sleep, is going to be fed, have the right diapers, et cetera.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:49:10):**  We need to do that, but we need to focus on the pregnant women or the baby in the belly,  and then that first nutrition.  We have to start the education system, not just teaching people to eat vegetables, but  
**[0:49:26-0:49:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:49:26):**  we need to create storytellers.  Society changes by stories because it's peer to peer if it's influencer, if it's from a  healthcare practitioner, if it's even on this podcast, we're telling stories, which people  
**[0:49:39-0:49:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:49:39):**  listen to and they attack.  Vegetables, no fruit.  If you remember one thing, vegetables, no fruit.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:49:44):**  Yeah, exactly.  That's right.  And this is the point, I would also really invest in opportunities on how do we educate  
**[0:49:51-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:49:51):**  on nutrition and soil and farming.  Where does the carrot come from?  You know, kids actually have answered Amazon delivery, some of these questions.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:50:01):**  This is such a scary part of society.  We need to get, this would be my next investment vertical, education systems into the daycares,  the kindergartens and the schools.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:50:12):**  Put a garden in every single kindergarten.  Teach the children how to grow the food, how to nurture the vegetables, how to harvest  the vegetables, how to cook it together.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:50:23):**  If a child actually goes through this, it's not just their knowledge on the food that  will increase, but food waste will drastically decrease because they see how much hard work  they put into creating that carrot.  
**[0:50:33-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:50:33):**  They will eat it.  And they will eat it with such great pride and they'll want to share it.  So there's so much that we can do to actually create this grassroots demand for better soil  
**[0:50:45-0:50:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:50:45):**  conditions, better aspects to growing because people, once they become healthier, when you  are healthier, you demand healthier aspects of life.  And then once you get beyond just how to eat, not just sugar food, but vegetables, you're  
**[0:50:58-0:51:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:50:58):**  going to say, how do I make that broccoli healthier?  And this is the change I think that we can drive by doing basic things in the school  system, the KEDA system.  
**[0:51:08-0:51:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:51:08):**  And then when children are older, we should have mandatory cooking classes in the schools,  mandatory agriculture classes in the schools.  Because if you took food away, we don't really have a society, right?  
**[0:51:21-0:51:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:51:21):**  Like we're done.  And these are the big things I would really invest behind.  And my next one would be the farmers.  
**[0:51:32-0:51:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:51:32):**  Coming from a farming area, it's not an easy life being a farmer.  And often the techniques that are out there in the amazing science, right, from crops,  from biodiversity, from crop swapping, different aspects of like, what is the next level of  
**[0:51:50-0:51:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:51:50):**  organic, like you said, this takes investment.  This takes funding.  And a lot of the farmers are just fighting day by day to get across and feed their families.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:52:00):**  So I would really put a proper amount of the investment in to move farmers from conventional  agriculture into this, not just organic, but what is the next level and its regenerative,  which we know now, but then what is the next thing that we can have this holistic approach  
**[0:52:17-0:52:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:52:17):**  that we can meet the food demand, but healthier, more valuable food.  And putting your MBA hat on, like the first few you mentioned education, and making sure  that every child, let's say in Germany or in Europe, or obviously globally, has access  
**[0:52:34-0:52:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:52:34):**  to the right food at the beginning, is there a way or maybe there isn't, but is there a  way to frame that or somehow figure out a way to attract investment amount toward because  there's always this, a nonprofit should do this probably in a certain way.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:52:50):**  But at the same time, the amount of nonprofit money available is nothing compared to the  investment amount available for crazy moonshot stuff.  But how could we frame this in a way like, okay, if we run this program, we create enough  
**[0:53:06-0:53:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:53:06):**  demand for companies like Pumpkin Organics to grow up, how could we connect it to, unfortunately,  a financial outcome?  How would you do that?  
**[0:53:14-0:53:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:53:14):**  How would you structure it in a way as an investment?  Yeah, you need to run it as if you're trying to build the next billion dollar entity, or  if you're running a middle stock company or something, you have to run it as a for-profit  
**[0:53:30-0:53:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:53:30):**  to build a sustainable business model company.  I think one of the reasons a lot of the things I mentioned don't get the funding they need  is because they're often managed by nonprofits or by government agencies.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:53:41):**  And through bureaucracy or lack of speed or agility or inability to attract talent you  need to drive a business, it takes 10 years, 15 years, a lot of frustrations, maybe 5x  the budget.  
**[0:53:55-0:53:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:53:55):**  I don't know.  I mean, I'm not trying to discredit it.  But if you actually started running every single nonprofit topic as a for-profit and  
**[0:54:02-0:54:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:54:02):**  built a proper business model behind it with proper checks and balances and investors,  you can actually, I think, change the business models behind these.  Because there is a business model behind health.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:54:14):**  We know that, right?  Food tech, health tech, all of these are the biggest growing or some of the biggest growing  investment pools in venture.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:54:23):**  But where the venture dollars are going are behind teams is because the idea is only the  very small part of where the venture money goes at the beginning.  It's behind the team, right?  
**[0:54:34-0:54:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:54:34):**  You invest in the founder, you invest in the team.  And these teams are often not the people that are running the nonprofit.  So I'm not trying to be disparaging.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:54:43):**  I actually think it's quite positive and quite exciting that if we actually invested behind  people that have the passion and purpose for a lot of these traditionally nonprofit topics,  they will figure out a business model.  
**[0:54:55-0:54:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:54:55):**  They will do it.  Because we've done it before.  And it might be with insurance companies.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:55:01):**  You need to figure out where the savings are being made or where the-  Why are the insurance companies not backing first nutrition?  Nutrition.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:55:09):**  Why?  This is mind-boggling.  And in Germany, like where we are, this is the land of insurance companies, right?  
**[0:55:16-0:55:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:55:16):**  It's mind-boggling how many insurance companies here and the power they hold.  But I've never seen a single, not a single one of them have called us.  Not a single one have said, hey, how can we get involved to help or do something?  
**[0:55:28-0:55:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:55:28):**  And I don't think any other like really truly signs back to the company is getting the calls.  That's really interesting.  It's just easier to pay to put the bandaid on or put more beds into the hospital or to  
**[0:55:42-0:55:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:55:42):**  ex-revive later in life versus actually trying to solve a bigger problem.  And it's also not politically sexy because no politician is going to get elected by saying,  oh, we're going to give children a fairer start in life.  
**[0:55:56-0:56:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:55:56):**  No, we're going to prevent the next part of the next effects of the pandemic.  We're going to prevent.  It's very, but you see societies not changing.  
**[0:56:05-0:56:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:56:05):**  You mentioned like the last six months or last year, it's like nutrition and health  and food seem to have at least a different spotlight on it now.  And there seem to be changes in, at least changes in choices we made.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:56:18):**  I mean, of course, a lot of local ones exploded during the pandemic because we couldn't get  anywhere or we couldn't get access to the supermarket or things were finished.  And from the flower boom to where do I get my eggs to where do I get my vegetables, et  
**[0:56:31-0:56:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:56:31):**  cetera, et cetera.  And some of that stayed luckily.  And I think people got used to different flavors and tastes.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:56:36):**  And now the question is, how do we sustain that?  And how do we scale it?  And as a final question, I mean, this is a whole different rabbit hole we just touched  
**[0:56:46-0:56:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:56:46):**  upon, but I find it fascinating.  There will be another interview to unpack, okay, how do we take traditional nonprofit  areas and invest in them with the specific focus of turning them into a large impact  
**[0:57:02-0:57:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:57:02):**  business models?  That's a different episode.  We'll come back to that at some point.  
**[0:57:06-0:57:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:57:06):**  But now as a last question, where do you, I mean, there are many like vegetables versus  fruit, but where do you, when you go to your, I don't know if they're peer conferences,  for shorter conferences of baby food, when you go there, what's the biggest one that  
**[0:57:19-0:57:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:57:19):**  you feel, even if you go to the organic more, say healthy side of the aisle, where do you  think most differently?  Is that the vegetable versus fruit?  
**[0:57:30-0:57:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:57:30):**  Is it something else?  I love to ask this question, what do you believe to be true about region ag, but in this case  about baby food that others don't believe to be true?  
**[0:57:38-0:57:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:57:38):**  And this definitely comes from John Kempf as an inspiration.  So I think what I believe to be true that I don't think many of my industry peers is  that first food actually matters.  
**[0:57:54-0:58:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:57:54):**  That we need to actually care, like if we truly cared for the child and their upbringing  and their ability to lead a healthier and happier life, we would be really vegetables,  plant-based, no pureed fruit, no sugar, no additives.  
**[0:58:13-0:58:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:58:13):**  I don't think the formula is crazy.  I don't think it's complicated.  And then the other aspect is healthy people are going to demand healthy food, right?  
**[0:58:24-0:58:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:58:24):**  Once we get people healthy, you don't want to go back to feeling sick.  You don't want to go back to pain in the body.  And healthy food comes from healthy soil, healthy land.  
**[0:58:33-0:58:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:58:33):**  And I really believe that we can, that it's a movement, regenerative farming.  It's not a marketing buzzword.  It's a full movement.  
**[0:58:43-0:58:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:58:43):**  But a movement needs to come from grassroots.  It needs to come from people that are going to truly want to change people's minds and  where their hearts, their energy, and where they put their time, and then ultimately their  
**[0:58:54-0:58:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:58:54):**  money.  I do believe it can change.  I do believe it's worth the investment in more recyclable packaging.  
**[0:59:03-0:59:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:59:03):**  The add-ons into products that children really learn how to engage with food and live a healthier  lifestyle and make good food choices.  And I do think we're pretty rare in the industry, not just here in Germany, but kind of anywhere  
**[0:59:18-0:59:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:59:18):**  that we truly think that we can impact children's health holistically and with longer term impacts,  starting with baby food.  This is a good way to end.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:59:27):**  But I still have one more question I would like to ask.  What about biodynamic?  We had White Leaf Provisions, which is a US brand that mostly sources all of their ingredients  
**[0:59:37-0:59:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:59:37):**  in Europe.  I mean, biodynamic is sort of a step beyond organic, fully certified, which makes it very  interesting compared to, let's say, the larger regenerative umbrella, where there's a lot  
**[0:59:51-0:59:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:59:51):**  of discussion and there should be a lot of discussion.  Let's not define it just yet.  Are there any ingredients you source like that?  
**[0:59:59-1:00:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=0:59:59):**  Is that cost prohibitive?  What's the reasoning behind not being fully biodynamic, for instance?  There is a market also for that.  
**[1:00:08-1:00:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:00:08):**  Yeah, there is definitely.  Many of our ingredients are, but unless you have everything on it, you cannot call your  product biodynamic.  
**[1:00:15-1:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:00:15):**  Right.  Otherwise we have more marketing washing and health washing, which we will never do.  So there's just not enough yet on it to be, I think, interesting enough where I would  
**[1:00:28-1:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:00:28):**  look to sacrifice taste development or diversity in ingredients, like the large amount of ingredients  that we put in our products and taste from sour to bitter, et cetera.  But yes, it is one of the next easy steps to do.  
**[1:00:44-1:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:00:44):**  It's not cost prohibitive.  It's marginally, it's just like organic in the cost structure.  It's just there's not everything available yet.  
**[1:00:52-1:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:00:52):**  And also we don't have a certification regulation yet, born on it.  So of course we have Demita and things like this, but it's also not black and white.  There's products that have that label on them that aren't even fully Demita.  
**[1:01:06-1:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:01:06):**  So again, it's confusing to the customer and producers.  So clarity, transparency, traceability, as soon as we make all of these things so much  more mandatory, I think things like biodiversity will just be one of the net winners.  
**[1:01:22-1:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:01:22):**  And it's a winner to everybody right now because it's just the next step.  Perfect.  Yeah, we had an interview, depending a bit on the production schedule, it will be out  
**[1:01:30-1:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:01:30):**  already and otherwise we'll link it later with activist and model Arizona Muse on Biodynamic  on the fibers, obviously, because she comes from the fashion industry.  She is in the fashion industry, but definitely also on the food aspects, which was absolutely  
**[1:01:43-1:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:01:43):**  fascinating.  If you want to learn more, check the links below or actually not below, check the links  in the show notes.  
**[1:01:49-1:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:01:49):**  And I want to thank you so much for your time.  And I know you have a very, very busy schedule and thank you so much for coming on here.  Thank you for the work you do and thank you for sharing.  
**[1:01:59-1:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:01:59):**  And I don't think it's the last time we chat about the importance of the first thousand  and then all the other thousand days that follow up.  Yeah, and the next, and the next.  
**[1:02:07-1:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:02:07):**  Thank you so much for having us.  It means a lot that you also let us have another ability to get the message out and really  start fighting for kids' nutrition.  
**[1:02:17-1:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:02:17):**  So thank you.  Yeah.  If you remember one thing, vegetables, not fruit.  
**[1:02:20-1:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:02:20):**  I just keep repeating.  I'll put it as an undertone in all the future interviews.  Don't forget vegetables, not fruit.  
**[1:02:27-1:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:02:27):**  Anyway, see you at the next one.  Thank you so much and have a great day.  Thank you.  
**[1:02:35-1:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:02:35):**  Thank you so much for listening all the way to the end.  For the show notes and links discussed, check out our website, investinginregentiveagriculture.com  forward slash post.

**[1:03:22-1:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:03:22):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question,  
**[1:03:32-1:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:03:32):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been following the space since 2011  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[1:03:44-1:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:03:44):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask?  
**[1:03:53-1:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:03:53):**  What is happening in the space?  What should you read?  What should you listen?  
**[1:03:57-1:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:03:57):**  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course?  
**[1:04:02-1:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:04:02):**  You the soil builders and investors in this space, the soil builders, people working in  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing,  platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line  
**[1:04:16-1:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:04:16):**  designers, holistic management, consultants, et cetera, et cetera.  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  
**[1:04:28-1:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:04:28):**  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies,  et cetera.  Is this course free?  
**[1:04:36-1:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:04:36):**  No, this is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[1:04:47-1:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:04:47):**  different means.  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[1:04:56-1:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:04:56):**  Thank you.  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[1:05:05-1:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:05:05):**  So you don't have to ride along.  We're going to look into why investing regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[1:05:17-1:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:05:17):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  find if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[1:05:28-1:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:05:28):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  So what is it not?  
**[1:05:38-1:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:05:38):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:05:46-1:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jaclyn-schnau#t=1:05:46):**  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking, click on

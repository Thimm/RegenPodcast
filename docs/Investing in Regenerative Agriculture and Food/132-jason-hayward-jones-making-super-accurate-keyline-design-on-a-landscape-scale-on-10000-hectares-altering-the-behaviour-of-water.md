### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2021-09-21)  
### Author(s): Koen van Seijen  

**[0:00:00-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:00:00):**  Water is absolutely crucial for any farm. Many brittle places have water but it's concentrated  in very short rainy seasons leading to massive erosion and long dry periods. So identifying  yeoman's key points and key lines on or off contour and thus altering the behaviour of  
**[0:00:17-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:00:17):**  water has proved to be very successful around the world in regenerating soils and farms.  It has been traditionally done by walking the land. What if we could teach an algorithm  to do it potentially even more accurately? That would open up landscape scale design  
**[0:00:31-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:00:31):**  of water systems and where to plant trees, graze animals, etc. etc.  Tempering climate change, bringing back rivers, preventing floods and obviously lots and lots  of nutrient dense food. The promises of Regen-ac often sound straight out of a science fiction  
**[0:00:48-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:00:48):**  book. And for these promises to be met we need to significantly scale regeneration to  a landscape scale within this decade. Welcome to a new series where we look into  the technologies needed to bring regeneration to a landscape scale. In this series we'll  
**[0:01:03-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:01:03):**  look at already existing technologies, digital tech, ag tech, new financing mechanisms etc.  that can scale fast enough during the next 10 years. Technologies which put significantly  more money into the pockets of farmers, landowners and land stewards who are regenerating their  
**[0:01:18-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:01:18):**  and our soils so they can go faster. And we'll ask the question what is missing?  What needs to be urgently developed over the next years?  We're very happy with the support for this series by the Grantham Environmental Trust  
**[0:01:31-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:01:31):**  which supports strategic communications and collaboration in solving the world's most  pressing environmental problems.

Thank you.  Welcome to another episode. Today I want to start with reading a small piece of an article  
**[0:02:11-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:02:11):**  that caught my attention and why I reached out to Jason to record this interview. For  the first time in Nigeria, marking an important milestone in the booming regenerative agriculture  sector, Regen Farm has used satellite data to produce an artificial intelligence generated  
**[0:02:24-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:02:24):**  design plotting a regenerative agroforestry system. Using Yeoman's key point and key line  principles on a landscape scale, designing including cultivation lines on contour multi-species  tree planting and water storage infrastructure was produced in the UK for use in Nigeria.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:02:42):**  The AI generated design was found to be accurate within 0.1 meters and the groundwork will  begin shortly to turn the design into reality. This obviously piqued my interest and I reached  out to Jason who agreed to come on the show and talk about this and a lot more. So welcome  
**[0:02:57-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:02:57):**  Jason.  Thank you, Corinne. It's great to be here.  I think it's the first time or one of the first times I saw the words Yeoman key point  
**[0:03:04-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:03:04):**  and key line used in the same sentence as artificial intelligence. So we're going to  unpack that. But first, I want to hear a bit more about you and how you came to work on  soil in soil and especially on water, obviously, like what led you to doing this regenerative  
**[0:03:18-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:03:18):**  work?  Sure, I've been in farming all my teenage and adult life. Farming was a lot different  back when I was younger. But something clicked, I think when I first stepped onto a farm,  
**[0:03:30-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:03:30):**  I kind of loved the environment, was embraced by it. And I thought, well, this is what I  want to do. And then led me to becoming involved in farm management and farm consultancy, not  just in the UK, but around the world. And the sustainability of food production was  
**[0:03:50-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:03:50):**  very interesting to me. I studied at Agricultural College in the UK where that wasn't a big  component of what we did. We were taught how to drive big tractors and spray chemicals  and all this put fertilizer everywhere. And I left that becoming a bit disillusioned,  
**[0:04:10-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:04:10):**  but determined that there is another way. And so working in different cultures and locations  around the world, I learned a lot from the way farming is traditionally done. And then  that sort of led me down the path of sustainable agriculture and permaculture. And I found  
**[0:04:33-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:04:33):**  myself in Australia, married an Australian girl, kids were born in Australia. But that's  where the permaculture movement started with Bill Mollison and David Holgrim. And that  really fascinated me. And 15 years ago, we were kind of sitting around campfires singing  
**[0:04:52-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:04:52):**  about permaculture. And then this term regenerative agriculture came in. But now, instead of sitting  around campfires, we're sitting in boardrooms talking about it. So it's come a long way.  And it's fascinating how it's come out of the shadows really. And people are grasping  
**[0:05:09-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:05:09):**  it. It's a big term, regenerative agriculture. And people first, what is it? How do we unpack  it? But it can be described in several ways. But it's definitely something that's very  important personally, in my life to pursue this and becoming interesting from a business  
**[0:05:28-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:05:28):**  angle for family farmers, commercial farmers. So it's a great journey to be on.  And coming out of that ag school where it was about big tractors and a lot of spraying,  and you mentioned you knew there was another way or there was a different way. How did  
**[0:05:45-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:05:45):**  you knew that? Was there one lesson that piqued any interest? Did you visit one of the leading  organic farms or one of the pioneers? Or how did you know? Because there was no YouTube,  there were very little books, there was no permaculture design course I'm imagining in  
**[0:05:57-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:05:57):**  the UK yet, or maybe there was, but it was in the shadows. How did you know, and didn't  just join a big tractor operating farm somewhere?  There was this one, I think about half an hour's worth of a lecture that started discussing  
**[0:06:12-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:06:12):**  organic production without the use of artificial things. And that's all we had to that little  hook to grab hold of.  It's turned your career around, basically changed your whole path.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:06:23):**  Yeah, it did. But of course, back then it was very slow. And people were very skeptical  of which, you know, a lot of people still are. But thankfully, that whole scene has  got bigger and more professional and more accepted. And now that side of things is growing  
**[0:06:38-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:06:38):**  quickly, as opposed to that conventional way of doing things is under pressure. So I think  we're going down the right route, finally. But there's a long way to go still.  There is no, it's where in the first innings or in the first minutes of a very long match  
**[0:06:57-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:06:57):**  or whatever sport we're playing. And how did that lead from singing around the campfire  about permaculture to working on technology to scale many of the key principles which  are around water, which will start to unpack? That seems a big, a big step, because many  
**[0:07:13-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:07:13):**  of the permaculture designs I've seen, and I've interacted with are relatively small  scale because they're very human focused, which is very good, because you need to interact  closely with the landscape and read it. And there are only very few people that are able  
**[0:07:25-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:07:25):**  to do that. But that hence, that's usually a relatively small farm even could be a huge  one in Australia, but still on the grand scheme of things, it's quite small. So where did  that from seeing the campfire to programming these kind of complicated algorithms? How  
**[0:07:40-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:07:40):**  did that go?  Sure, sure. Well, I was at the time, and I still do have a consulting business, just  helping farmers improve their business performance. And that involves me at some point, walking  
**[0:07:54-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:07:54):**  around the fields and measuring things and with a tape measure or a spirit level or  something like that.  When you say measure things, what is that?  
**[0:08:04-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:08:04):**  Well, you know, for designing, you know, let's have something here, something, it was a very  practical way of doing things hands on, face to face, and fantastic. And I enjoy that still.  But my idea was it well, if, if we were to open up regenerative agriculture to be more  
**[0:08:23-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:08:23):**  accessible to many more farmers, it's going to require millions of me to do this. And  so we need to be able to scale out with some kind of technology. And so the idea for Regen  Farm was to develop, this was my initial thought to develop a digital version of myself. And  
**[0:08:43-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:08:43):**  so some way, I can interact not just with say, 20 farmers a year, but 2000 or 20,000.  And that was as that stage, that was as far as my technological knowledge went. So I said,  well, I have this basic idea of what we want to do. And I went to the Impact Lab, Environmental  
**[0:09:04-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:09:04):**  Impact Lab at Exeter University Science Park, and it was their opening day. And I rocked  up there with a kind of one pager and said, look, I've got this idea. And I talked to  the people there from the Impact Lab and from Rothamsted Research, and they said, well,  
**[0:09:18-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:09:18):**  this looks interesting. And let's develop a prototype to see where this might go. And  so they did. And we field tested that with a number of local farmers. And it got a little  bit of traction, a little bit of interest. You could see this little click in people's  
**[0:09:34-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:09:34):**  minds saying, oh, hold on a second. This is useful. This is a way we can use a kind of  a simulation software to help those farmers who are nervous or reluctant to change their  production methods and go down a different pathway. This could possibly be a good tool  
**[0:09:53-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:09:53):**  for them. And it all started there, really. But I quickly realized that that was the limit  of my technological knowledge. And so I had to involve other people for coding development,  algorithm development. And that was the real interesting bit for myself in these early  
**[0:10:12-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:10:12):**  stages. It's how do you take this high-tech coding algorithm sector and merge it with  the agricultural industry, which is at some point archaic, like this, I described it as  a lumbering dinosaur that's just lurching forward. And how do we join those two worlds  
**[0:10:37-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:10:37):**  together and make some improvements? And again, that was kind of just a very loose description  of the ideas I had. But involving other people, algorithm development experts, other technology  people helped us shape something that would be very usable by farmers and by different  
**[0:11:00-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:11:00):**  sectors to help all of those stakeholders take a few more steps down that regenerative  agriculture path. So that was kind of the early stages of it. That was about three years  ago now. And things have really come along well and gone off in different directions  
**[0:11:18-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:11:18):**  that I never thought we'd be going down. But it's just wonderful.  And the first steps, were you already working on or going after the water side of things  on a landscape level or on the farm level? Was that your entry point saying, okay, if  
**[0:11:34-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:11:34):**  there's one thing that technology could help and helping these farms that want to make  a few more steps or want to make the first few steps, we have to start with water? Or  if you look at the scale of permanence, it's one of those first steps. Like why did you  
**[0:11:47-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:11:47):**  choose for the water side of things and not, I don't know, using AI technology to help  better compost facilities or better local bio fertilizer or something like that?  A wise man once told me that there are only eight ingredients to any food production system  
**[0:12:08-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:12:08):**  anywhere on earth. And they are, he explained to me, in order of magnitude, I guess, sun  and air, soil, water, plants, animals, people and money. And if you mix all those together  in different ways, you have an agricultural food production industry.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:12:29):**  So the first two, sun and air, it's hard to manipulate those. Like kind of it is what  it is. So let's leave those. But the next two, soil and water, if you can improve those  things on a farm, make them better, have them work with you, then you're setting yourself  
**[0:12:50-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:12:50):**  up for success. So working with the soil and water was very appealing. And it took us back  a few steps. Then we started to think about, okay, how do we understand how soil and water  behaves on a landscape? How do we capture that information? And how do we use that to  
**[0:13:12-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:13:12):**  help us redesign how a farm works using these principles that were first developed by P.A.  Yeomans back in the 50s in Australia. He works in very brittle landscapes, very dry landscapes  where water is crucial. Absolutely king if you don't have it.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:13:33):**  So what are the principles for anybody? I mean, we know Yeomans also from a plough,  which is not really a plough, but there's technology came out of that ecosystem as well.  But what are the principles for anybody that hasn't done those deep dives?  
**[0:13:48-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:13:48):**  So very simply, when he talks about water and about key points and key lines, if you  can identify in a landscape where the water changes behavior, where that convex landscape  going down the hill turns into a concave landscape, at that key point is the point at which water  
**[0:14:10-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:14:10):**  begins to behave differently, becomes less erosive and more able to deposit things. And  at that point, you're able to passively manipulate its behavior by taking it sideways along contours  and rehydrate the landscape. So I thought, well, if we can have a technological tool.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:14:31):**  Because you used to do this by hand, used to walk the land. And a lot of people do that.  And it's very, I've seen it happen. It's very difficult to do. It's very difficult to do  by eye as well, because landscapes always seem different than they actually are. Like  
**[0:14:45-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:14:45):**  water behaves, it seems to run uphill in some cases, but it's not obviously. But it seems  our eyes are good at it, but not very good. And so you need to train a lot to be able  to walk the contours properly and then to do it. But it's such an essential job that  
**[0:14:59-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:14:59):**  we've done. If you look at most landscapes, I'm looking at a hilly landscape here right  in front of me. We haven't like we just planted even up the hill. If you see most landscapes  when it rains, or when water comes, it's yeah, it's absolutely not capturing it to the fullest  
**[0:15:14-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:15:14):**  to use an understatement. But so you used to do that by hand and by eye and with some  very rudimental tools. And you said, No, let's bring that to technology space where there  are no human eyes that can make interesting errors.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:15:26):**  Exactly. In order to be able to do it by eye, you have to be this sort of landscape whisperer  that, you know, knows how it works. And I, you know, I'm not that, that's for sure.  So I can get it to within about five meters or something like that. But it has to be more  
**[0:15:44-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:15:44):**  accurate, I think, to get the most from it. So we employed some data acquisition and ran  a lot of data through some test algorithms to define not only where that key point would  be, but also how we could do different channels along contour or just off contour. And it  
**[0:16:06-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:16:06):**  really taught us how the power of artificial intelligence in large landscape designs is  really useful. Now if we had a couple of acres, and you know, we can go around and it's about  there and that's fine. But the landscapes we're working on are hundreds of 1000s of  
**[0:16:24-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:16:24):**  hectares. So for me to walk around with a with a tape measure in a spirit level, it  just wouldn't happen.  Even if you had 100 of Jason's or even I don't even know what what's what would be the number  
**[0:16:38-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:16:38):**  of people in the world that are let's say landscape whisperers, they're very much obviously  there they're always busy because they have an endless amount of clients. But even them  all put together probably couldn't easily do 100,000 acres or hectares like that. And  
**[0:16:52-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:16:52):**  we need to do like 2 billion hectares that are degraded. So it's just the math math just  simply doesn't work even if we 10x it or 100x the amount of people that are good at this.  And the speed with which you can do it as well. So we designed this system which for  
**[0:17:06-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:17:06):**  one of our clients in in Nigeria, we'll speak about that.  Yeah, let's talk about the project just describe this is in if I understood well, in northern  Nigeria just describe the landscape because we are in an audio podcast just to for us  
**[0:17:18-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:17:18):**  to feel if we won't walk around there. What would we see? What would we touch? What would  we feel and smell?  Sure. Northern Nigeria based around the city of Kano very flat, very arid and the water  
**[0:17:30-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:17:30):**  comes in large amounts during the rainy season and then drains away the soil is very low  in organic matter. So it's kind of boom and bust territory, massive amounts of erosion.  So even when it's very flat, this kind of water work is possible and essential. Asking  
**[0:17:48-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:17:48):**  a very stupid question probably.  But yeah, yes, yes. I mean, it's easy to see in a mountainous landscape or hilly landscape  how water behaves. But if you get flatter, those undulations are far more subtle and  
**[0:18:03-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:18:03):**  nuanced and and you can't sometimes see them with the naked eye. But you can see the results  of it with big channels being cut, big erosion taking place. So to have something that measures  the water movement in centimeter differences and it starts there, right? So a river channel  
**[0:18:24-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:18:24):**  starts to erode a bit, a bit every year and all of a sudden you've got something as deep  as, you know, several meters and your topsoil is gone. So that landscape lends itself to  accuracy, high resolution data. And so what we did was for the first test plot, we thought,  
**[0:18:44-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:18:44):**  well, let's go for it. Let's do a 10,000 hectare plot and see what we can go.  Let's start small.  Let's start small and manageable, of course. And everybody, all the tech guys just groaning  
**[0:18:54-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:18:54):**  at me going, oh God. But no, no, let's go for it. And this was on our client's land,  Tajuddin Dantatta's land, his personal land and the community that surrounded it. So it's  not a random place. It's actually something we'll be working on in the future with this  
**[0:19:10-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:19:10):**  design. So we continue to develop the algorithm and inserted sort of additions like agroforestry  lines and water channels, water storage areas, where would be the best places for these to  be sighted on the landscape. Just to come up with a big design as a starting point.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:19:30):**  And the data you use was satellites plus others or what's the input data you need to get to  that accuracy?  Yeah, it was satellite data down to about one meter resolution. The free stuff, the  
**[0:19:45-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:19:45):**  Sentinel data, EU satellites is 25 meter resolution. So to look at those subtle differences on  a flat landscape, it wasn't enough. It's like looking through the landscape through a blurred  set of glasses and you couldn't see it. So it was expensive to buy the data, but we bought  
**[0:20:03-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:20:03):**  it and pushed it through the algorithms and they gave this design. And then I was in Nigeria  a few months ago and the team says, okay, we think we've got it. Can you go around and  ground truth it and see what's what? So they gave me a few test areas to do this. And the  
**[0:20:20-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:20:20):**  day we went, it was during Ramadan, so nobody's drinking any water. It was 45 degrees and  we must have walked for several hours just ground truthing this thing. It was a very  difficult day, but by the end of it, we all kind of compared notes and said, well, that  
**[0:20:39-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:20:39):**  works. This thing works not only on paper, but we plotted where the starting point would  be, where an agroforestry system would go, where the water channel would go. And it made  sense.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:20:49):**  Like you walked it and you could see that you would have said something similar if you  wouldn't have had that already made design.  Exactly.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:20:58):**  Were there surprises? Like things that you considered, like I wouldn't have thought about  it, but actually it makes sense what the algorithm suggested.  There were no surprises, but it was just confirming that the algorithm had learned to do this,  
**[0:21:10-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:21:10):**  to place this design on the landscape accurately. And we were walking around with the local  farmers and they said, yeah, how does water behave here? Where traditionally does the  rain fall and where does it go? And so just some local knowledge infused with that artificial  
**[0:21:27-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:21:27):**  intelligence really was very exciting. It was a big relief for us that it worked.  Yeah, we made it, but it didn't make any sense. They were saying, no, no, water never goes  like that.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:21:38):**  Yes, yes. So we got back to the car and rehydrated ourselves. And then we said, well, we really  have something quite powerful here.  So basically there's key point and the key lines were sort of mapped on the map or there  
**[0:21:54-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:21:54):**  was a layer on the map. And then you started adding extra layers of where could some ponds  be or some other water features. And then you expanded it to agriculture features like  agroforestry systems and where does tree make sense, but also which type of tree, like what  
**[0:22:08-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:22:08):**  is the level of detail you managed to get to?  Yeah, so we built up in different layers where the contours of the land are, how key points  and key lines work on that digital elevation model.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:22:19):**  And just currently the land is, you said it's flat, it's very dry. It rains. When it rains,  it rains a lot. Are there a lot of trees on the landscape? What is the current state or  what's the current feature?  
**[0:22:30-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:22:30):**  It's cultivated, but in straight lines with big erosion valleys cutting through. And so  you could see how that production system is placed incorrectly on the landscape. It doesn't  work from an ecological point of view. So if we were to change the design of how cultivation  
**[0:22:50-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:22:50):**  worked and how water flows and it would be regenerative rather than degenerative.  Would it mean to cut down all the current trees and start from scratch or do you adapt  the system to, okay, that one needs to go or that one, we need to plant more there or...  
**[0:23:06-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:23:06):**  No trees are ever cut down. And some of the trees in this landscape were very mature mango  trees. So you wouldn't want to be cutting any trees down at all.  Even if they're on the wrong spot.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:23:18):**  Even if they're on the wrong spot, leave them. They were there before us and they'll be there  long after we're gone, I'm sure, but never cut down a tree. It's done its best to be  there. So leave it. So our designs would be placed onto the existing tree pattern.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:23:34):**  And the algorithm takes that into account because it sees the current features, which  are trees and houses and small villages.  Exactly. And trees know what they're doing. So they're obviously doing well there. They  
**[0:23:44-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:23:44):**  found a good place to grow.  So they are in a good spot. They're not in the wrong spot.  Exactly. So let's try and use those to help us understand how the landscape works and  
**[0:23:53-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:23:53):**  mimic their growth patterns rather than trying to force it in a direction it doesn't want  to go.  So what's next now? Where are you? We're talking summer 2021. What is the client doing currently  
**[0:24:06-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:24:06):**  or wants to do? Or what are the next steps in implementing some of this or testing?  Let me speak a bit about our partners in Nigeria. It's only about a year ago, actually, that  they first contacted us, the Dantatta family, a very old family with a great legacy in northern  
**[0:24:24-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:24:24):**  Nigeria. And they work with many hundreds of thousands of small farmers. The Dantatta  family process a lot of rice and groundnuts and all those, the soybeans, all those too  for the Nigerian market and overseas. But they quite correctly thought, as we move forward  
**[0:24:45-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:24:45):**  and climate change begins to really hit these small farmers, not just in Nigeria, but everywhere,  it's their business that is under threat as well as the small farmers livelihood. So to  have some kind of regenerative agriculture program for their entire outgrower schemes  
**[0:25:03-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:25:03):**  is not only the right thing to do, but it's also good for business.  So they said, can you help us design the landscape and then work with the farmers to switch them  over to transition them? So it was with Tajideen's vision and working with our technology that  
**[0:25:21-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:25:21):**  we put those two things together and came up with a big plan for them. And this plan  is also being embraced by the UK government and their aid programs, forcing their thinking  down, okay, let's use regenerative agriculture as this vehicle for development. And then  
**[0:25:41-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:25:41):**  the more farmers we can get involved in these schemes, that has flow on effects for the  environment and social benefits, a whole raft of benefits. So it was from that discussion  and that close relationship with the Dantatta family that we said, okay, this is one of  
**[0:25:58-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:25:58):**  our firm footprints overseas and a very interesting environment to work with where you can really  see the results of regenerative agriculture, not just working with the water infrastructure  and how that flows in the landscape, but things like cover crops, humic soil additives, a  
**[0:26:19-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:26:19):**  whole suite of interventions actually, which put humus back in the soil, organic matter,  carbon, of course, and therefore you can really see how the landscape responds quickly. I  guess there, like in Australia, you're starting from a very low base and any carbon and organic  
**[0:26:39-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:26:39):**  matter you can put back in the soil, really see the benefits quite quickly.  So that's our work there is ongoing. I go to Nigeria every few months to push it along  and it's the whole regenerative agriculture theme has become embraced by people to such  
**[0:26:58-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:26:58):**  an extent that they didn't have words for regenerative agriculture. So we've had to  make some up in Hausa and Fulani languages. So farmers are now, they understand what we're  talking about. We're not talking technical things. We're using that regenerative agricultural  
**[0:27:16-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:27:16):**  term in local languages. So again, that helps them adapt and transit to those types of production  methods.  And what's the vision for that landscape or where does the landscape could go to or tends  
**[0:27:31-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:27:31):**  towards like it's very hot as you described, it's very arid, but there's also water in  limited time, not necessarily quantity. So where do you see that going to? What does  this design? A lot of extra trees, agroforestry systems, different grazing and vegetables.  
**[0:27:47-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:27:47):**  What do you see that landscape, the potential in five, 10, 15 years?  Yeah, it's a mixture of all those things you described. It's agroforestry systems, it's  integrated grazing, it's reintroducing the complexity back into the system because that  
**[0:28:05-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:28:05):**  then is a big safety net for resilience going into the future. So it has several purposes,  regenerative agriculture in that part of the world. It's of course a food production, resilient  food production as we go into the future, livelihood regeneration as well. It's also  
**[0:28:22-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:28:22):**  useful to stop the Sahara Desert coming further south, like the Great Green Wall project.  We're contributing to that and seeing how farming communities with regenerative agriculture  can kind of plug a few gaps here and there. It's about also working with farmers that  
**[0:28:40-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:28:40):**  farm around biodiverse areas which are under pressure. So in that part of the world, there  are several river valleys, wetland areas that farming inevitably encroaches onto as farmers  seek more productive area. But if we can work with what's called a jurisdictional approach,  
**[0:29:03-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:29:03):**  so we work with all the area including the biodiverse areas, so those are conserved and  regenerated but also the farming areas are regenerated so there's less pressure on those  very important biodiverse areas. So then we've encapsulated all the area, we're able to increase  
**[0:29:25-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:29:25):**  food production, revenues from that increase, but then it also lines the whole communities  up for complementary revenue streams like carbon credits or biodiversity credits. There's  a whole raft of these things coming up now which can only help and lift up and we're  
**[0:29:43-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:29:43):**  getting a lot of interest from finance providers that deliver climate solutions. So these big  projects are of interest because they can pour a lot of climate finance funding into  it and in return, conserve biodiverse areas, help local farmer livelihoods. It's just a  
**[0:30:03-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:30:03):**  great package we can offer.  And so with the design, I wouldn't say done, but let's say the first design done and even  down to the level of what tree species, what's the next step? When is planting beginning  
**[0:30:16-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:30:16):**  or what's the implementation look like? Or do you see, okay, we actually need a few more  versions of the software and of the algorithms before we are down to the point that we can  say, okay, here we need to plant, so let's go. Or like, what do you see there currently  
**[0:30:31-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:30:31):**  and what are the next steps there?  Yeah, well, ultimately with farming at some point, somebody's got to go into a field and  do something. So in essence, essentially the technological artificial intelligence enabled  
**[0:30:47-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:30:47):**  designs the easy bit. It's accurately costed, planned down to the minutest detail. The next  step we've got is to continue our technology development, but we're already getting this  first project financed. So the design is important. The finance to make it work is important.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:31:08):**  And you see the design as a key point to, I wouldn't say convince, but to get especially  larger scale projects off the ground, you need to make it, yes, to simulate it, to make  it visible what could happen. Because otherwise we always talk about yeoman and key lines,  
**[0:31:25-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:31:25):**  et cetera, but for large financial institutions or large investors, that just doesn't, doesn't  convince too much.  No, no. And the simulation is really important because we're talking about improving things,  
**[0:31:40-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:31:40):**  creating impact, regenerating natural capital. We're making big claims here. So in order  to be able to substantiate those claims, we have to be able to measure and monitor and  prove with data that we've gone from this level to this level, which is better. And  
**[0:31:58-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:31:58):**  it's really essential to do that. We're not, we're not providing a generic model here that,  oh, if you try this, something like this might happen. We're actually designing a location  based specific design and then measuring and monitoring that and also monetizing it at  
**[0:32:17-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:32:17):**  the end. So data and measurement throughout that from a financial perspective, from an  ecological regeneration perspective, even down to things like if we're claiming that  livelihoods are better and more jobs are created, tracking that. So people can really convince  
**[0:32:37-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:32:37):**  these people if you can show them the hard numbers that, yeah, we've had some impact  here and let's try and do that on another area and another area. And so the whole thing  can replicate and expand. And that's where I think the power of our tool really works  
**[0:32:54-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:32:54):**  because we can, we can say, okay, we've done 10,000 hectares here. If we were to translate  that into 1 million hectares, what would that be like? What would that mean? Yeah. And do  you see the interest now from the finance world to work on this specific one? Is that  
**[0:33:10-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:33:10):**  the phase where you're in now? Like, okay, how do we actually get into the field and  get going? And how do we finance that? Or is it something that's on the side of the  client at a farm and a family and a person from they have for sure connections to the  
**[0:33:23-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:33:23):**  finance world if they're processing at that scale? Like what's holding you back now to  implement the 10,000 hectares? Well, we're not sort of handing over the design to them  and saying, there you go. Thanks very much. We're off. No, we can order the trees. Yes,  
**[0:33:37-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:33:37):**  yes. Now we're involved in the next phase of implementation and actual project development  because if we can stay with the project throughout its inception and getting into a mature phase,  what's important for us is to stick with it and of course, make sure it's delivered correctly,  
**[0:33:56-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:33:56):**  but also to get data from the project itself and feedback into our algorithm so it sharpens  up, we can learn from it and that therefore the designs in other places are more accurate.  So for us, it's a long term engagement. And of course, if you're selling any carbon credits  
**[0:34:17-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:34:17):**  from that project, it's important to be able to measure those every year and report on  that. Otherwise, you've got to give all the money back. So it's not what we want to do.  It's quite an essential, also to invest it. If people have, I don't know, supported a  
**[0:34:35-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:34:35):**  green bond for invested in the green bond for large scale landscape regeneration, you  want some kind of reporting and some kind of it's not enough just to have the simulation  and to have the nicely rendered simulation where you can wear your VR glasses and see  
**[0:34:51-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:34:51):**  how it might look. It's nice at some point to have the actual growth rate of the trees  and to have the rain infiltration rates and things like that to actually back up.  I think it's essential because you've entered into a financial transaction with a buyer.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:35:06):**  And if I was buying these credits, I'm going, well, what am I actually buying here? Is this  a bit of greenwash I can tell my shareholders or have I actually bought sequestered carbon  or water credit or a biodiversity net grain credit? I want to be able to say, okay, it's  
**[0:35:26-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:35:26):**  gone from here to here. It's actually real. There are the independent measurements. I  feel comfortable and excited by my purchase and I want to buy some more. And that's where  we want to set up everybody for.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:35:40):**  And from the technology perspective, having made that, I wouldn't say the jump, but definitely  the step from singing at the campfire and permaculture or walking the land, walking  it personally and now involving a lot of tech. What do you feel that is still missing to,  
**[0:35:56-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:35:56):**  if anything on the tech side to get regenerative ag to a regeneration to a landscape level?  For us as a business, it's data and the availability and affordability of data. If we can get access  to that, it kind of opens up areas.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:36:13):**  And data meaning what deep land actually looks like to see that into the algorithm.  Yeah, it's high resolution stuff and it's partly available by satellite, but that's  expensive. We can partly acquire it through commercial drones who have like a heavy payload  
**[0:36:31-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:36:31):**  and good cameras. And so we can take a lot of data, a lot of photogrammetry images from  that.  But going forward, if we could do this at scale and measure things accurately at scale,  
**[0:36:46-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:36:46):**  particularly carbon sequestration or water flows or ecological functioning in general,  it's the data, it's the cost of that data. So we can really put it through our algorithms  and machine learning tools. So it's not just wild claims we're making, it's actually how  
**[0:37:06-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:37:06):**  the landscape is functioning. And I think that's a very exciting area, not for us, just  us to get involved with, but agrotech in general, in that we have a whole world to map here  and understand better.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:37:19):**  It's rather like all the data points that are taken from us on social media to understand  our behavior. And it's done very cleverly. But let's try and do that to figure out how  a landscape functions. And so we can know if that landscape is in trouble or it's regenerating  
**[0:37:38-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:37:38):**  or degenerating. Let's have all those data points in the landscape so we can come up  with a better design. We can embrace those natural systems and then make them work in  our favor. We're part of it. We should be part in understanding how the ecosystem works  
**[0:37:55-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:37:55):**  because we are part of it. And the data to understand that really needs to develop a  lot more. And we're excited to be part of the sector, just designing a little bit of  it. It's very fulfilling.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:38:07):**  And you're saying that basically when it comes to soil on the landscape scale, but also soil  on a farm scale, there's very little we know how it behaves and how it could behave and  how water could move on a landscape, unless you are a landscape whisperer. There's actually,  
**[0:38:24-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:38:24):**  it's an enormous gray area or enormous unknown area where we're moving into to start discussing  how to design as we have done, but in a very destructive way, landscapes to move on the  regenerative continuum to start making steps forward and to understand water flows, biodiversity  
**[0:38:43-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:38:43):**  flows, animal flows, plant flows and all of that. And it's, but you're saying we're very,  very, very early on that. And there's some satellite data, but not accurate enough. And  there's a lot of other data that we actually have in biodiversity data on most of the world.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:38:57):**  Yeah, exactly. I think, you know, after the second world war, we, that pushed to produce  more food and narrow down the factors you had to consider to produce food so you could  manage them closely. Seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, insecticides, machinery, the enterprises which  
**[0:39:21-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:39:21):**  were developed just had five or six factors to consider and try and push nature out of  the way so we can measure how much seed, measure how much fertilizer and look what's happened.  It's been a, yeah, we produced a lot more food, but at what cost? So if we look at it  
**[0:39:38-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:39:38):**  through a different lens, all those natural processes and systems that operate in the  landscape, the nitrogen cycle, the carbon cycle, all those soil web systems, you know,  biological chemical, we don't really know a lot about them and it's going to take more  
**[0:39:59-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:39:59):**  than our lifetimes to find out about them. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't trust them.  And so if we encourage those natural systems to come back and use them, I like to think  we use them as part of the team, part of the farm management team. We don't understand  
**[0:40:19-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:40:19):**  how they work.  Exactly. But they do their job. So who cares?  And importantly, from a farm business point of view, they are free and will never fail.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:40:31):**  So having those guys as part of your team, that's a wonderful thing to have. It's a big  safety net, I think. So encouraging them to work continuously 24 seven without a break  for free and helping you. Why wouldn't you?  
**[0:40:48-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:40:48):**  And if you could change one thing in the food and agriculture system, you had a magic wand  and you have a magic power. What would that be?  I think I'd like to open up people's minds and take the blinkers off a bit.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:41:04):**  Which one specifically?  There's not just one. It's just the question of taking the blinkers on because I think  people have fear of change. And it is not just in farming, but in life in general, that  
**[0:41:17-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:41:17):**  fear of change. But what we'd like to do is present to those people who are reluctant  to point their farm businesses down the regenerative path. Let's have a look. Let's give you some  examples of where it's worked. Let's simulate what might happen on your farm so you're more  
**[0:41:33-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:41:33):**  comfortable. And then there's a few stepping stones.  Because then when it's on your farm, I know in a pre-interview you mentioned that you're  working in this specific project in Nigeria also basically with VR glasses to be able  
**[0:41:45-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:41:45):**  to see how a landscape could look like. And then suddenly if it's on your land or the  land you know and you could see what it potentially is, do you think that will open up people's  mind to it? Or then it's like, no, that's too radical. We could never work here, even  
**[0:42:00-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:42:00):**  though I saw that the neighbor or down the street a lot further. But do you see it on  if it's on their land? Is that a potential trigger point?  I think so. And it's one of the trigger points as a farming business that's in trouble gets  
**[0:42:14-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:42:14):**  further and further to the kind of hitting the brick wall. If we can show them this,  okay, here's what it would look like. Put the goggles on and see how your farm might  look going into the future. There's a light at the end of the tunnel. And I think it's  
**[0:42:28-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:42:28):**  to do as well with succession issues on the farm. As the older generation come towards  retirement, they're passing the responsibility on to the sons and daughters. The sons and  daughters are going, like, great, but oh my goodness, we're in trouble. We've got to do  
**[0:42:46-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:42:46):**  a turnaround. So enabling them with technology. And I noticed really, when I walk around a  farm, you know, you do a farm visit and the family usually walks with you, the older generation  talking, but the younger generation usually have an iPad or an iPhone in their back pocket.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:43:07):**  And so, yeah, of course, taking the family unit as a whole, but really focusing the future  on that younger generation who don't mind going on and simulating and visualizing and  putting the goggles on because it's their responsibility for the future. So it's that  
**[0:43:24-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:43:24):**  point of connection with that younger generation that's really making things come alive. Not  just in Nigeria, but here in the UK where we're based. Again, those family farms who  are struggling a bit. Looking at these new government schemes coming out, how do we get  
**[0:43:41-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:43:41):**  involved with that? What about technology? It's kind of a very fertile area to explore  with them. So that's what I, we don't necessarily, it's not what I change. I think that's what  is changing at the moment. And we're in a good spot to help out as much as we can.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:43:59):**  What would happen if you would be in charge of a relatively large investment fund? So  it has a long, it could have a long investment horizon. It doesn't have to be a 10 year or  whatever fund, but it has to be invested. Let's say you have a billion dollars or a  
**[0:44:12-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:44:12):**  billion pounds sterling to be invested. What would you focus on? I'm not saying down to  the dollar. I'm curious what your priorities would be if you had these kind of assets under  management to put to work.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:44:24):**  It's a nice thought to have, isn't it? And we're, hopefully we're heading down. It's  a burden as well. Yeah. It's a tremendous responsibility, but you know, I'd think of  myself as being in a very fortunate position, like a great artist being commissioned to  
**[0:44:42-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:44:42):**  produce a masterpiece. But that masterpiece is a living, breathing, natural asset or a  portfolio of assets that has to perform financially. But also we have to educate and enable the  realization that these assets perform in several other ways alongside being financially profitable.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:45:15):**  Again, that's kind of a more artistic way of describing it. But if we look at that holistic  picture, we are getting the most from our farms, from our rural assets. And I think  now certainly some of the large institutional investors we're talking to are widening their  
**[0:45:39-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:45:39):**  thinking. We had to start with describing how a farm would behave as if it were an office  block and you know, real estate.  Yeah. Change some light bulbs, put a solar panel on the roof.  
**[0:45:55-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:45:55):**  Yeah. How much can you rent it out for a square foot? That kind of thing. Well, yeah, you  can describe a farm that way to engage first of all, but then we've been widening out the  conversation. And interestingly, some investors we spoke to, they got all that and we thought,  
**[0:46:12-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:46:12):**  okay, well, we've been speaking about natural capital regeneration and all the different  revenue streams you can get on there and the returns per year are acceptable for their  investors as well. So that was all good. And then interesting, they come back to us with  
**[0:46:29-0:46:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:46:29):**  actually what they're really interested in. And it's different depending on who you talk  to. And one of them said, well, we're really interested in these farm assets, as they call  them, providing a vehicle for new entrants into the farming industry. We get all the  
**[0:46:50-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:46:50):**  financial stuff, the natural capital stuff, all that, but it's how do we...  Generation transition. Could be that sons and daughters could be completely new people  entering because there are a lot actually access to land for many aspiring farmers using  
**[0:47:05-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:47:05):**  regenerative practices is very, very, very difficult because they often, unless you inherit  it, it's very difficult in many places to get your hands on a sufficient scale piece  of land to do any farming. And of course you can rent it and that's it, but there's the  
**[0:47:19-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:47:19):**  land access and land ownership piece is a very big one.  And I think these issues aren't new. If you've read Thoreau's book, Walden, I mean, back  in the 1850s, these issues were there. It's how do farmers work all their life to pay  
**[0:47:34-0:47:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:47:34):**  off the mortgage to own the farm and then what? We're still there. And so if we can  work in this new urgent era of climate change and have the landscape as a potential solution  for that and take the issue of I have to own the farm in order to be able to contribute  
**[0:47:56-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:47:56):**  and have a career, if this farmland can somehow be held in long-term trust and the investors  are getting there, they're all happy, but it removes the hurdles and the huge cash needs  and loan needs and mortgage needs to buy and the burden going forward of, gosh, I've got  
**[0:48:16-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:48:16):**  a, how much do I owe this month to pay off? Let's remove that. Let's focus on the farming.  Let's focus on the soil. Let's focus on the water and let the people that are really focused  on that financial asset management do that. And we're in the middle trying to help the  
**[0:48:34-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:48:34):**  process, help with the management, help manage those assets in a profitable and productive  way, but also solve that food production resilience issue as well.  And as a final question, where are you contrarian in the sector, in the RegenX sector? What  
**[0:48:52-0:49:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:48:52):**  do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture and food that others don't? Definitely  inspired by the question Joan Kemp always asks, if you are somewhere contrarian.  Well, you know, there's always a few naysayers in any point in life. I believe regenerative  
**[0:49:09-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:49:09):**  agriculture to be more productive and profitable. It's difficult to prove that sometimes because  we don't have farm data on regenerative agriculture farms going back 30 years. We have some excellent  examples though that are doing very well now. So I believe absolutely that to be true. I  
**[0:49:33-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:49:33):**  also believe that coming back to the issue of change and farmers and reluctance, nervousness,  I also believe that a farmer once said to me, the most difficult thing to change in  a farmer is the field between his ears. It's that if we can change mindsets, then everything  
**[0:49:57-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:49:57):**  starts to flow from there. Sometimes these farmers are in deep financial and personal  crisis. And so if we can just provide a small light at the end of the tunnel to say, give  this a go, it will probably work. But let's go that together. That kind of coming back  
**[0:50:18-0:50:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:50:18):**  to those eight ingredients of agriculture, people, they're further down the track, but  they're absolutely essential to make it work. So without that, you know, natural systems  operate, but the person factor, the people factor in this are critical to have motivated  
**[0:50:36-0:50:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:50:36):**  people understand enabled by technology so we can get there quicker and at scale, I think.  I always say last question and it never is, but what is on the roll for like after this  design, are you working on any other places, exciting designs? I'm imagining quite a few  
**[0:50:53-0:51:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:50:53):**  people reached out after you published it on LinkedIn. I would definitely link the article  below in the show notes. What is planned for other designs at other places, other circumstances  and conflicts?  
**[0:51:03-0:51:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:51:03):**  Yeah, yeah, we're getting contacted daily from all the way around the world, but our  focus for the next few years is in Nigeria and other countries in Africa doing similar  types of projects, larger landscapes, but in Africa, smaller individual farmers grouped  
**[0:51:21-0:51:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:51:21):**  aggregated together. We have some really interesting opportunities in Central Asia where the dynamics  are totally different, massive landscapes, but very small numbers of farmers and really  lots of abandoned land, if you like, or land just left there not being productive. And  
**[0:51:42-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:51:42):**  so that's kind of a blank slate for us to design something that's really, really good  and efficient. And of course, back at work, we're based back in the UK, this whole...  You're using the design software as well. It works in different climates, let's say,  
**[0:52:00-0:52:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:52:00):**  as well. It works in the UK.  Yeah, and that's going back to the importance of data, getting data from the specific location  you're working with. So yeah, Central Asian environments, huge, massive, Northern Nigeria,  
**[0:52:12-0:52:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:52:12):**  yes, but small farmers. And back in the UK, where we're starting to get a lot of traction  is by family farmers who are really, like I said, up against it, need to change direction,  but also from institutional clients like water companies who say, how can we engage farmers  
**[0:52:32-0:52:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:52:32):**  to solve one of our problems like nitrate runoff or whatever it is? So those clients  are really getting interested. Yeah. So the technology works in all these different places  for different people.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:52:43):**  As long as the data is good and detailed.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  I want to thank you so much, Jason, for sharing, opening up and this conversation. And I will

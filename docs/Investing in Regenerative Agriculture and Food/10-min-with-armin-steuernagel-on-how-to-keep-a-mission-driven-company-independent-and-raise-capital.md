Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the planet mattered  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:19-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:19):**  To learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil people local communities and ecosystems  while making an appropriate and fair return  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration because so many of the pressing issues we face today  
**[0:00:33-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:33):**  have their roots in how we treat our land grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors  big and small and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt soil underneath our feet  Before we get started I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I will definitely  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:51):**  continue to do so and release about an episode a month but at the same time I would love to take  this further share more interviews there are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative  food and agriculture more depth improve the quality maybe even doing some video series  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:01:07):**  So I started a patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself if these  podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means I invite you to support me and make this  happen for more information please find the link to my patreon account in the description below  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:01:22):**  And now without further ado the interview. Enjoy!  There was one particular moment or one particular event that somehow pushed me to think even more  about it that was actually an employee of mine so I found it also one company in the organic food  
**[0:02:19-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:19):**  sector and organic food for children and my co-founder and I we always told everybody  ourselves our families but also our employees well we're all getting up every morning to get  children excited for good and healthy food that's the reason you know that's why we're working here  
**[0:02:36-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:36):**  and one day one of the employees of of us came to us and said wait a minute is that actually true  are we actually working for that purpose or aren't we actually working for you both because you can  monetize it you can sell it you can pass it on to your children they can monetize it etc are we  
**[0:02:56-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:56):**  actually working for your wealth and that was kind of a provocative question but we realized legally  and she was right and so and I realized you know without intending it without wanting it  I had set up a legal entity that would somehow serve my wealth so that that somehow felt strange  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:23):**  that's when I realized oh there's something wrong I have to look for different ownership structures  to somehow make sure that we can all work really for a purpose here and um I was very  very happy with the fact that I was able to make a profit this year and um and that I can remain  
**[0:03:45-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:45):**  a steward and don't become just a normal you know shareholder and in the future an absentee owner  who just collects profits two main principles that I became to believe that they are actually  a self-owned and um so one thing that all of them make sure is the is self-governance so they all  
**[0:04:14-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:14):**  somehow make sure the majority of the voting rights the majority of the steering wheel basically  of the company isn't a tradable commodity anymore so the steering wheel cannot be sold it cannot be  passed on to children and the second principle besides the self-governance principle is the  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:31):**  principle of purpose that all of these companies even big companies like Bosch really adhere to  and that's yeah principle of purpose that basically says our entire endeavor our our  company is there for a purpose and yes we need to make profits but profits are seen as a means  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:49):**  to an end and not an end in itself and what does it mean concretely it means you are really  if you make profits of course you pay back investors or you're paying even a good return  to investors but then the rest you are reinvesting you're donating and you are capping um the upside  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:07):**  for all stakeholders to make sure that the that there's enough money being reinvested and used  for the purpose we often talk about impact but maybe leave it at that and things change companies  change interest change personal situations change and and maybe at some point we find ourselves in a  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:27):**  in a position where there's an offer or a lot of money on the table like in many cases or like the  organic food movement now is being threatened by that and it's very difficult to say no to that  when there's a huge huge offer on the table but when there's we maybe forgot to make the  
**[0:05:42-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:42):**  logical next step to actually make it a legal legally binding agreement to not change the  mission and and unless you have that there are only very few people that say no to  i don't know how many pensions and their children's pensions and who's to blame if somebody offers 200  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:58):**  million or 50 million or whatever the number is for your company that you and or your colleagues  work for so long the problem is it goes to one family  i would say our human psyche is not built to resist to that kind of 100 200 million  
**[0:06:19-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:06:19):**  200 million and offers especially one industry is currently under attack and that's of course the  industry you're also working in the organic food industry in the agriculture industry  with all the pioneers who really wanted to change the world and now for years nobody was interested  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:06:43):**  in their companies and now suddenly everybody becomes interested and wants to buy them  and one good example there is organically grown company ogc in the u.s portland oregon that's the  second largest organic produce wholesaler in the u.s i think and with well only 200 million in  
**[0:07:06-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:07:06):**  revenue and 200 employees they were founded as a co-op by farmers already 30 years ago and and  and that's when they realized oh damn you know we're in a very dangerous situation around us  all of the you know organic pioneers are bought up by you know seven generations was bought up  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:07:27):**  you know that whole foods was bought by amazon etc we have to change something and and they looked  around said okay we want to actually set up something like student ownership and what they  found is a very very unknown structure it's a perpetual purpose trust that means it's a trust  
**[0:07:45-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:07:45):**  that um unlike all other trusts doesn't have any beneficiaries any natural persons as beneficiaries  but it has a purpose in that case it's organic agriculture as the purpose and it's perpetual so  it doesn't end and um they set this up and now the question was how can we get the company in there  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:06):**  and that's when they needed uh they needed financing and also a new kind of financing they  needed basically alternative buyout capital alternative private equity and capital in order  to buy out some of the old investors and that's when we went in there and we negotiated with them  
**[0:08:26-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:26):**  probably the most impactful would be to have a law that basically makes farmland  steward owned in that sense so everything that i was talking about companies now that for land  they are not asking what i would call the power question because steward ownership is asking the  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:51):**  power question who has the power in our companies who has the power in organizations we're all  spending most of our times in are these people who can buy the power so is this money it's the  principle of money or are these people who just um by chance inherit the power is this the principle  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:09:09):**  of blood or do we have another principle a principle of purpose or stewardship that someone  makes sure they're always people and that are able and values aligned able ability and value  relatives so a different kind of family so to say so to speak um that are getting the power there  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:09:28):**  and that's that's deep power question just listen to the summary of the interview for the full-length  interview please find the link in the description below if you found the investing in regenerative  agriculture and food podcast valuable there are a few simple ways you can use to support it number

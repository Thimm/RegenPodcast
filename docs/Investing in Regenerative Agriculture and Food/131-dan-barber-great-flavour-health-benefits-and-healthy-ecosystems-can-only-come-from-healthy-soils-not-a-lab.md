**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:00:14):**  Flavor always wins.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:00:16):**  What's the role of chefs in the regenerative transition and why did this chef started the  
**[0:00:20-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:00:20):**  seed company?  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:00:21):**  And he feels pretty optimistic about the future of the food system.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:00:26):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the  
**[0:00:31-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:00:31):**  planet mattered.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:00:32):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:36-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:00:36):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:42-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:00:42):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:00:46):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:48-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:00:48):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:52-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:00:52):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:00:55):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:01:00):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:01:04):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:28-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:01:28):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:01:30):**  So welcome to another episode today with chef and co owner of blue Hill in Manhattan, New  
**[0:01:35-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:01:35):**  York and blue Hill at stone barns.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:01:37):**  Plus the co founder of row seven seats.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:01:39):**  Welcome chef Dan Barber.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:01:40):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:01:41):**  Nice to be here.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:01:42):**  And to start with a personal, I mean, you've shared it before, but I'm wondering if there  
**[0:01:45-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:01:45):**  is more to that story when you saw the potential of regenerative agriculture, where soil came  
**[0:01:51-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:01:51):**  really into, into your life, was it a moment or was that more like a longer, slowly evolving  
**[0:01:58-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:01:58):**  journey?  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:01:59):**  There is a moment that that was a kind of before and after moments.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:02:04):**  I think the thing that came to mind is that I was standing at a, at a farm in upstate  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:02:11):**  New York run by owned and run by a man named Klaus Martins.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:02:16):**  And Klaus had been supplying me with wheat for many years that we ground, we milled into  
**[0:02:23-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:02:23):**  bread and a flower for bread.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:02:25):**  And it was extraordinary.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:02:26):**  We made bread that I, I had become quite well known for, and I had set out to write a book  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:02:31):**  about farm to table cooking.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:02:34):**  And I really was starting the book with the extraordinary wheat that I milled from classes  
**[0:02:43-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:02:43):**  of growing practices.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:02:45):**  And so I decided to end up visiting him and learning the recipe for why his wheat was  
**[0:02:51-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:02:51):**  so spectacular.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:02:52):**  And I arrived and stood in the middle of field and it took about, I don't know, 30 seconds  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:02:59):**  for me to realize that of the 2000 acres of his farm, very little of it was actually in  
**[0:03:05-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:03:05):**  wheat.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:03:06):**  I saw, I saw some beautiful wheat growing, but I also saw tons of other crops, rye and  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:03:11):**  buckwheat and millet and barley.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:03:15):**  And they were all timed to this meticulous rotation, meticulously timed rotation that  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:03:23):**  provided soil fertility for his major crops.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:03:27):**  One of which being wheat and another being corn.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:03:29):**  But the, the image was just so immediate for me.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:03:32):**  It was like I was being touted as a sort of leading farm to table chef.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:03:39):**  And here I was only supporting a tiny slice of the farm.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:03:44):**  And what I learned is that all these other crops that Klaus was growing that I mentioned  
**[0:03:49-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:03:49):**  and the dozens of others that I saw and learned about that day were there to provide the fertility,  
**[0:03:57-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:03:57):**  the diversity, and ultimately the fertility that allowed for the wheat crop to be so successful.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:04:03):**  And tasty.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:04:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:04:05):**  The fertility that was successful in my world was really tasty, but yes, the fertility allowed  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:04:10):**  the wheat to express those flavors that were so extraordinary.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:04:15):**  But I wasn't supporting the whole farm.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:04:17):**  I wasn't supporting the health of the soil.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:04:19):**  I was supporting the king crop, the wheat crop, which I was embarrassed about.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:04:24):**  So I went back and I really changed my entire cooking, not so much velocity, but I deepened  
**[0:04:31-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:04:31):**  how I thought about my cooking and how my menu should set out to support the whole farm.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:04:38):**  We talk about nose to tail of an animal.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:04:40):**  We really talk about the nose to tail of an entire farm.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:04:44):**  And that was the lesson of my, of my time with Klaus and, and a deepening understanding  
**[0:04:49-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:04:49):**  of what it means to be organic, which is an organism.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:04:52):**  And in the context of deliciousness, which I think is truly rooted in soil.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:04:59):**  And I know it is from my experience, what enables that to happen is a farmer who is  
**[0:05:04-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:05:04):**  practicing the kind of diversity that allows fertility to thrive and gives you a crop like  
**[0:05:11-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:05:11):**  the wheat that I was tasting.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:05:12):**  The irony is that, and it's not a nice irony, is that Klaus's other crops, dozens or so  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:05:18):**  other crops that he was growing to get that fertility, you know, he didn't really have  
**[0:05:22-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:05:22):**  a market for.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:05:23):**  So the rye and the buckwheat and the barley were mostly thrown into bag feed for animals.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:05:28):**  And for which Klaus made pennies on the dollar and made his money on the wheat.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:05:33):**  So it's also a lesson in not just supporting the whole farm, but in why organic agriculture  
**[0:05:39-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:05:39):**  is so expensive.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:05:40):**  Because the one cash crop has to cover for everything.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:05:43):**  Yeah, it's the cash crop has to cover everybody else, all the other crops that nobody wants  
**[0:05:47-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:05:47):**  to eat.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:05:48):**  And then that got me, and that's what got me to really change my book.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:05:52):**  And I ended up writing a book called The Third Plate about the whole farm because it, because  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:05:58):**  you can't be sustainable without a diet that supports the entirety of it.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:06:03):**  And that, you know, and then you end up realizing that cuisines, the history of cuisines is  
**[0:06:07-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:06:07):**  just about that.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:06:08):**  It's about a pattern of eating that is rooted in diversity that gives you soil health, that  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:06:14):**  gives you flavors and diversity that is to be celebrated.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:06:18):**  So that's the lesson that I came away with.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:06:22):**  And you created, and I will definitely link the book below in the show notes, and you  
**[0:06:26-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:06:26):**  created your famous rotation, the risotto.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:06:29):**  And did you see that being taken by other chefs?  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:06:32):**  Do you see that as a role of chefs to rediscover that what we have done based on the landscape,  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:06:38):**  what a landscape can provide, which is changing over time now as we have changed the landscapes  
**[0:06:42-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:06:42):**  quite dramatically.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:06:43):**  Do you see that as your role and potentially other roles of other, the roles of other chefs  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:06:48):**  in this, it's a regenerative transition?  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:06:51):**  I think it's the role of all chefs, yeah, is to support what is truly regenerative.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:06:56):**  That's kind of the point of good cooking, you know, and it gets lost on us sometimes.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:07:00):**  I think it's being rediscovered.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:07:02):**  Has it changed in that moment, since that moment in that field, which is, I don't know,  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:07:06):**  eight, ten years ago maybe, have you seen shifts around you for the good and the bad?  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:07:11):**  Yeah, what I've seen is the culture of food changed dramatically in the last ten years.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:07:15):**  Sure, I mean, look, when I started Blue Hill, you had to have certain things on the menu.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:07:21):**  Anyways, you didn't have a lot of choice if you wanted to be a high-end restaurant.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:07:26):**  Today the definition of a high-end restaurant is to celebrate those crops that are grown  
**[0:07:31-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:07:31):**  locally.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:07:32):**  Actually, even more than that, the best restaurants in the world now are about a menu that is  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:07:38):**  filled with ingredients that you can't get anywhere else.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:07:42):**  And what the definition of that is hyperlocal.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:07:45):**  The whole shift in food culture has enabled, or led by chefs, has been about distinctiveness  
**[0:07:53-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:07:53):**  of place.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:07:54):**  And that's about ecology, and that's about celebrating your environment in a way that  
**[0:08:00-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:08:00):**  can be expressed through crops.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:08:03):**  Cooking is celebrating that.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:08:04):**  So that's a very positive development.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:08:07):**  It's a rarefied part of the food culture because it's a white tablecloth restaurant.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:08:12):**  Do you see it getting out of the restaurant as well?  
**[0:08:15-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:08:15):**  Has it been, or if not, how can we make sure it goes beyond that table where we eat amazingly,  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:08:22):**  we celebrate it, but then it's Saturday evening and then on Monday we do something completely  
**[0:08:26-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:08:26):**  else.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:08:27):**  How do we get it to the kitchen of the daily night?  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:08:30):**  Yeah, well, I do think that happens.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:08:34):**  I do think you bleed into the everyday food culture.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:08:38):**  It just happens slowly.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:08:40):**  And unfortunately, as you just mentioned at the top of this hour, we don't have a lot  
**[0:08:45-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:08:45):**  of time here.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:08:46):**  We have to move this along in a way.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:08:48):**  I think chefs play a big role in it because chefs pursue flavor, and true flavor really  
**[0:08:53-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:08:53):**  only comes from good soil.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:08:54):**  That's the end of story.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:08:55):**  Do you see that?  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:08:56):**  Because I see a lot of people, especially at technology conferences or even in general,  
**[0:09:02-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:09:02):**  that throw at me, but why don't we just grow everything at vertical farms?  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:09:05):**  I see the efficiency, or let's get in some GMOs or some lab-grown meat.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:09:10):**  And I'm not looking for an answer there because that's a whole different discussion.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:09:14):**  What do you say to people when they throw that on the table, basically, to you?  
**[0:09:18-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:09:18):**  Why bother with soil so much?  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:09:20):**  Why bother with soil so much is, again, my shiv is flavor.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:09:25):**  And so I know that you can only get that, the people who argue that you can get that  
**[0:09:29-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:09:29):**  from hydroponics or from multi-story growing facilities are quite wrong.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:09:36):**  And what I've discovered is that there's so much to discover.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:09:40):**  This idea that we actually know what's happening in soil or that what's to be learned about  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:09:46):**  soil, soil health and the potential for human health and flavors is something that our great  
**[0:09:52-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:09:52):**  grandparents did is preposterous.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:09:54):**  It's laughable.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:09:55):**  We know so little.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:09:56):**  What is the latest thing you discovered about soil that really surprised you?  
**[0:10:00-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:10:00):**  I've been talking to a plant breeder, a corn breeder, who has been breeding a type of corn  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:10:07):**  that fixes nitrogen on its own.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:10:11):**  There is a wild variety of corn in Mexico that was discovered many years ago that has  
**[0:10:16-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:10:16):**  this ability, but he's been breeding for it.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:10:19):**  He's been taking those genetics and actually selecting for it.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:10:22):**  So he's got a corn plant that, I mean, this is revolutionary.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:10:25):**  He doesn't have to take you through it.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:10:26):**  I mean, I think you understand, but I just want to make sure everyone who's listening  
**[0:10:29-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:10:29):**  understands that.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:10:30):**  Walk us through it.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:10:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:10:32):**  Well, just in America, we have 180 million acres of corn and soybean rotation.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:10:36):**  100% of those rotations are based on fertilizers.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:10:40):**  Of those fertilizers, 70% of that accounts for nitrogen, which is injected into the soil  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:10:47):**  in a chemical form to make the plant grow faster and more robust.  
**[0:10:53-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:10:53):**  The consequences of that on carbon release in the atmosphere, on polluting water, asphyxiation  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:11:01):**  waterways, all the way down to Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico is extraordinary.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:11:07):**  The effects on bird life, I mean, on and on.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:11:09):**  It's hard to pinpoint one reason for a catastrophe.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:11:12):**  It's so vast.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:11:13):**  The amount of acres is just, and the amount of applied stuff.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:11:17):**  The amount of damage is extraordinary and there's a lot of reasons for it, but it's  
**[0:11:21-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:11:21):**  hard to not argue that nitrogen addition to crops isn't in the top one or two.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:11:29):**  When you talk about corn, you're really talking about the two evils, this monoculture of corn  
**[0:11:35-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:11:35):**  and nitrogen.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:11:37):**  That's the background.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:11:38):**  Here we are with a breeder who no one's ever heard of in the middle of the country, who's  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:11:44):**  breeding a corn variety that fixes its own nitrogen.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:11:47):**  It doesn't need any nitrogen.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:11:49):**  He's showing me a picture of his corn grown organically without any additions, but very  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:11:56):**  healthy soil.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:11:57):**  He's done all the rotations like that farmer Klaus did when I was watching him in the field  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:12:02):**  to lock and load the soil with the kind of fertility that can really give corn its boost.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:12:07):**  But also, the corn fixes its own nitrogen and he was growing it next to literally 15  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:12:13):**  feet away from corn plants that were fed the requisite amount of nitrogen.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:12:18):**  His growth was almost exactly the same as the nitrogen additions.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:12:23):**  And the taste, or you didn't taste it?  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:12:26):**  Well, it's interesting you say that because I cannot wait for the harvest, which is coming  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:12:31):**  in three weeks.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:12:33):**  This is a feed corn, but I still am very excited to taste it.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:12:36):**  But the reason I'm telling you all this, because we started by saying we know nothing about  
**[0:12:40-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:12:40):**  soil.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:12:41):**  And the reason I'm saying that is because what he has discovered himself is fascinating.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:12:47):**  What he was explaining is that it's not that you're simply selecting a corn plant that  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:12:52):**  can fix its own nitrogen, because that in and of itself is a revolution.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:12:57):**  That in and of itself, if we had the mindset, the techno guys that you were talking to at  
**[0:13:03-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:13:03):**  your conferences, if you could explain just the biological opportunity of that is so extraordinary  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:13:10):**  and so exciting, that in and of itself it's like Jeff Bezos going to space.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:13:15):**  That's the whole thing.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:13:16):**  But let me tell you what I really got excited about.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:13:18):**  What I really got excited about is the only way the corn fixes nitrogen from the air naturally  
**[0:13:25-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:13:25):**  is because of soil biology.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:13:27):**  And what he's discovered is that at the rhizosphere, which is where the root system is in the soil,  
**[0:13:35-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:13:35):**  there is through this corn plant an injection, literally an injection of bacteria.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:13:41):**  And he's watched it on film, where it comes out of the roots of the corn plant into the  
**[0:13:46-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:13:46):**  soil community, microbial community.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:13:49):**  And what he's saying is that, look, this plant will literally feed like a sugar syrup into  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:13:55):**  the soil, but you have to have the right community to reply.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:13:59):**  So it's a coalescing of what is literally ejected from the corn plant into this rhizosphere.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:14:08):**  The biological community is eating each other, they're cohabitating, and that environment  
**[0:14:15-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:14:15):**  needs to be correct because otherwise the plant won't go back up into the plant.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:14:22):**  So he's saying, yes, this plant is amazing, but actually it's only amazing because of  
**[0:14:28-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:14:28):**  the soil.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:14:29):**  And what the potential to, and this opens up this whole other area of investigation,  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:14:35):**  which is what is the biological potential of a soil community that is truly healthy?  
**[0:14:41-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:14:41):**  Well, nobody's doing that.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:14:44):**  What's the taste potential or the biomass potential of a landscape?  
**[0:14:49-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:14:49):**  Well, that's what I'm getting at.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:14:52):**  And what I wanted to show you a picture of was the corn fed to chickens from this natural  
**[0:14:59-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:14:59):**  fixation.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:15:00):**  And what you would see is a picture of a yolk that is so orange, it looks like the setting  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:15:07):**  sun, you know, at seven o'clock in Hawaii.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:15:10):**  It is so bright.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:15:11):**  I've never seen anything like it.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:15:13):**  You almost think it's fake, like somebody played with it.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:15:16):**  I thought it was fake.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:15:17):**  He showed me all these pictures of it.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:15:18):**  I could not believe it.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:15:21):**  And you know, now not to get too philosophical about it, but it's like, what it gets you  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:15:26):**  to it, you have to get philosophical because it's so, you have to be referenced.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:15:30):**  Because it's life.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:15:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:15:32):**  It's kind of what this goes to.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:15:33):**  It's like when you talk to technoguise, what is always missing is just a reference because  
**[0:15:37-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:15:37):**  technological driven anything, and especially agriculture, is actually compared to what  
**[0:15:44-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:15:44):**  I just described, is so simplistic.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:15:47):**  It is so A to B. Like what excites me about talking to this guy and many other even soil  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:15:52):**  scientists that I talk to is if they all come back to the reference, it's because they don't  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:15:56):**  know what's going on.  
**[0:15:57-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:15:57):**  They really don't.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:15:58):**  They just like, this is not been studied near enough.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:16:03):**  We spend our money going up to space and we don't spend our money going down.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:16:07):**  We know more about the soil on Mars than we know about our own.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:16:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:16:11):**  Right.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:16:12):**  And the reference is the sense of like, this is the most complex biology imaginable.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:16:16):**  And we don't have a language to excite people about biology.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:16:20):**  We have a language to excite people about technology because that's, you know, that's  
**[0:16:24-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:16:24):**  the Steve Jobs.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:16:25):**  We do.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:16:26):**  It's the language of taste.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:16:27):**  It's the language of flavor.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:16:28):**  Well, but I, that would be my argument is that the only way to get people to be excited  
**[0:16:32-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:16:32):**  about biology is to taste it because I think you can.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:16:35):**  I think when the biology is right and here's the reverence part.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:16:38):**  And we're starting to measuring it and you're doing that with geocleptin and I mean, there's  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:16:41):**  starting to come, the technology piece is coming in this case to help to measure the  
**[0:16:46-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:16:46):**  nutrients.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:16:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:16:48):**  Right.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:16:49):**  And I think what it ends up being is a gift.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:16:50):**  That flavor is a gift.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:16:52):**  And then what the chicken is saying or the egg is saying to you is you've grown that  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:16:56):**  corn correctly and I'm now going to reward you with an egg that's going to blow your  
**[0:17:01-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:17:01):**  mind and then you get a flavor like that and it becomes revelatory.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:17:05):**  And that soil talking to you, it just speaks in a language through that kind of flavor.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:17:09):**  And obviously the health benefits.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:17:10):**  You look at the egg, it's like you look healthy.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:17:13):**  I mean, you feel healthy, you're just looking at it, you know, it's not like, you know what  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:17:16):**  I mean?  
**[0:17:17-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:17:17):**  It's like there's so much beta carotene running through that thing.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:17:19):**  It probably sets you up for life.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:17:22):**  So to me, it's just, it's so exciting.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:17:24):**  It's so exciting.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:17:25):**  I get so frustrated.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:17:26):**  It's because we know so little.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:17:29):**  And yet when you try and explain this to people, it's like biology, it's like it's so complex  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:17:33):**  and it's inefficient because look, to feed the biological community is inefficient.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:17:38):**  It takes a lot.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:17:39):**  A, we don't know a lot, but B, what we do know is that you can't grow one thing of one  
**[0:17:44-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:17:44):**  variety over and over again.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:17:47):**  Technology allows you to do that.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:17:48):**  So all of a sudden you're just frustrated and the response back is, well, we have a  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:17:53):**  population that's one third hungry and a population that's exploding and don't you want to feed  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:17:58):**  people and you know, God, so anyway, you get all chipped up with that stuff.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:18:03):**  And so if we are in that phase of knowing so little, which is extremely exciting, I  
**[0:18:07-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:18:07):**  think that we're in the first innings of this discovery process, what would you tell to  
**[0:18:13-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:18:13):**  entrepreneurs listening, but also investors listening that are excited that read your  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:18:16):**  book, read other books, have visited farms and are ready to invest or ready to work in  
**[0:18:22-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:18:22):**  this space?  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:18:23):**  Like where should they, without giving investment advice, obviously, but where should they focus?  
**[0:18:27-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:18:27):**  Where should they get to work if they're not a chef?  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:18:29):**  You don't want investment to me, but I would say that if you are an investor and you're  
**[0:18:33-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:18:33):**  looking at the ag space, your horizon should not be on five year horizons.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:18:40):**  Your horizon should be on 20 and 30 years.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:18:42):**  And if your horizon is on 20 and 30 years, I'd bet with biology every time.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:18:47):**  There's no question in my mind that as we go down this road of technology, of replacing  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:18:54):**  the cow with impossible burgers and doing all the hydroponics that we're doing, we are  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:18:59):**  going to discover that the health consequences of this are extraordinary.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:19:03):**  And there is going to be a rush back to real food.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:19:07):**  We need to be ready.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:19:08):**  And if you're ready, if you're an investor, you are going to do quite well at the end  
**[0:19:13-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:19:13):**  of the game.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:19:14):**  I think it's a lot, you know, it reminds me of when I was growing up, I just thought of  
**[0:19:17-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:19:17):**  this.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:19:18):**  When I'm growing up, you know, everyone was eating margarine.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:19:20):**  I don't know if you're old enough to buy me margarine.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:19:23):**  In the Netherlands, it was a thing.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:19:24):**  Yeah, Unilever became quite big with this stuff.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:19:26):**  In the US, to eat butter in the 70s was like laughable.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:19:30):**  It was like, well, we've, you know, scientists have discovered that is bad.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:19:35):**  Something that's fats bad and that can be so much more healthy and, you know, as a fine  
**[0:19:39-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:19:39):**  substitute for butter.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:19:40):**  And there's this woman Joan Gusso who's one of my favorite nutritionist scholars.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:19:46):**  And she has this quote that says, I never switched to margarine because I always trusted  
**[0:19:51-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:19:51):**  cows more than scientists.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:19:53):**  That's what I would, if I was an investor, that's what I would look at.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:19:55):**  I would look at biological systems and the health of animals and humans as much more  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:20:01):**  trustworthy than what science can do, technological science anyway can do.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:20:06):**  And that's not specific advice for an investor, but that would be my overall.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:20:09):**  It's a direction.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:20:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:20:11):**  And what do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:20:13-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:20:13):**  You've been in this space for quite a bit and regenerative food systems that others  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:20:16):**  don't.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:20:17):**  So where are you contrarian?  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:20:18):**  And this definitely comes from John Camp.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:20:20):**  My contrarian aspect of it is that I wrestle at what is being called regenerative because  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:20:27):**  it is always about doing less damage to the earth and to the environment, to soil health.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:20:33):**  Always less.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:20:34):**  We are a regenerative farm because we're using 40% less nitrogen fertilizer.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:20:38):**  We are a regenerative farm because we cut down pesticides by 80%.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:20:42):**  We are a regenerative farm because our water use is now 50% of what it was 10 years ago.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:20:47):**  Those are always the data points.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:20:50):**  We're less bad than we were 10 years ago.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:20:52):**  And to be regenerative, the true definition of it.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:20:56):**  If there is one.  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:20:57):**  If there is.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:20:58):**  Well, I think we should say there is.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:21:01):**  And truly, to regenerate is to make something better.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:21:05):**  And we don't know how good looks like, actually, or how better looks like.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:21:08):**  We know how better looks like.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:21:09):**  We don't know where it goes, where it ends.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:21:11):**  Well, we don't think of agriculture in terms of improving ecological function and ecological  
**[0:21:17-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:21:17):**  systems in the environment.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:21:18):**  We look at it always in, let's do less damage.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:21:22):**  And if you want to improve an environment, then you go to wild.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:21:25):**  You go to protected space.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:21:28):**  That's the American experience.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:21:30):**  We built the national parks.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:21:32):**  That was to say, we're going to put a fence around it and move everybody who was in it  
**[0:21:38-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:21:38):**  by chance.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:21:39):**  Right.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:21:40):**  If you want to visit that, you can experience with real natures.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:21:41):**  Otherwise, you can shit all over the earth.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:21:43):**  Otherwise, as long as we have these protected spaces.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:21:46):**  But what if we thought about agriculture really in an indigenous context, which is why agriculture  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:21:53):**  history is so important.  
**[0:21:54-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:21:54):**  Because in that context, you think about systems that were in place that improved the environment  
**[0:22:00-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:22:00):**  for where food was grown.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:22:01):**  And that is not only possible, it's absolutely necessary to feed the world in the future.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:22:07):**  So regenerative, if you're truly regenerative, you are leaving your farmland in better condition  
**[0:22:14-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:22:14):**  every year than you had it the year before.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:22:17):**  I do think that's possible.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:22:18):**  And for your neighbors and for your children and for everyone you're passing the farm on,  
**[0:22:22-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:22:22):**  that should be the responsibility of agriculture.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:22:23):**  And that kind of ethic is not in the American ethic of growing food.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:22:27):**  And you mentioned asking financial advice from you probably is not a good idea.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:22:31):**  But let's say overnight you're no longer a chef, but you become in charge of quite a  
**[0:22:35-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:22:35):**  large fund, let's say a billion dollars.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:22:37):**  Maybe I have to increase it to 10 billion now because of inflation and billions flying  
**[0:22:41-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:22:41):**  around.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:22:42):**  But let's say you have a lot of resources.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:22:43):**  What would you invest in?  
**[0:22:45-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:22:45):**  What would you prioritize?  
**[0:22:46-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:22:46):**  I'm not asking to the dollar amount, but what would you prioritize in terms of investments?  
**[0:22:50-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:22:50):**  And it can be a very long term fund.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:22:51):**  Yeah, grass fed beef probably.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:22:53):**  If you're going for the big dog in America, I go for grass fed beef or grass fed milk.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:22:58):**  Because the environmental impact on grain fed meat and grain fed cows for milk is so  
**[0:23:03-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:23:03):**  extraordinary.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:23:04):**  We just talked about 180 million acres of corn and soybeans.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:23:08):**  75% of that's going to feed a cow.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:23:10):**  And even the breeder you just mentioned is growing feed for cows.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:23:13):**  It's not, I mean, you're going to eat it, you're going to use it, but you're going to  
**[0:23:16-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:23:16):**  be very small in his rotation, unfortunately.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:23:19):**  That's very right.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:23:21):**  And if you could change one thing overnight in the global food system, honestly, you have  
**[0:23:25-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:23:25):**  a magic wand and you no longer are in charge of your fund, unfortunately.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:23:29):**  But if you could change one thing overnight, what would that be?  
**[0:23:32-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:23:32):**  In the global food system, if I could change one...  
**[0:23:34-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:23:34):**  It could be American specifically if you wanted as well.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:23:37):**  No, no.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:23:38):**  I mean, I would change one thing is I would relocalize everything.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:23:40):**  That's where the best food comes from.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:23:42):**  I'm still a chef when you give me that example.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:23:44):**  So if I'm still a chef, I'm still after the best flavor.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:23:46):**  And the best flavor comes from micro regions.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:23:49):**  And so if I have a wand that I can wave, it would be to reinvigorate the localized food  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:23:55):**  economies of the world, which, you know, today they're still there.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:23:59):**  It's not like I'm talking about 50 years ago.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:24:01):**  I mean, today 90% of food grown in the world is grown on five acres or less.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:24:07):**  We do not yet have the westernized conception of how food is grown.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:24:12):**  We are exporting that idea to the rest of the world and it's a disaster.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:24:16):**  But it's not too late.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:24:17):**  It's really not.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:24:18):**  I'm not saying that to be positive because there's not a lot positive to say about the  
**[0:24:22-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:24:22):**  state of agriculture these days.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:24:24):**  But it is to say the reality is, you know, we are at an inflection point and there is  
**[0:24:28-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:24:28):**  still a road to take that could be a lot more beneficial to the environment, to our health  
**[0:24:33-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:24:33):**  and to the pleasure of eating.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:24:35):**  And what's the role of seeds just to wrap up when you started the seed company and I've  
**[0:24:40-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:24:40):**  eaten the pumpkin actually once.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:24:42):**  Oh yeah.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:24:43):**  I haven't followed it too closely.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:24:45):**  Where are you now and what's exciting on the seed part apart from the corn part, which  
**[0:24:49-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:24:49):**  is super exciting.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:24:50):**  Anything else beyond that?  
**[0:24:51-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:24:51):**  Yeah, we're working.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:24:52):**  I'm having conversations with breeders like the guy I was just talking about who are looking  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:24:56):**  at selecting seeds for flavor and for nutrient density.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:25:01):**  And it turns out that when you select seeds for flavor, you are automatically selecting  
**[0:25:05-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:25:05):**  seeds that give you great health potential nutrient density and most often are beneficial  
**[0:25:13-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:25:13):**  to the soil microbial community.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:25:16):**  It's very interesting those three things.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:25:18):**  When do we ever have the opportunity to strike, you know, a bullseye with one thing in three,  
**[0:25:26-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:25:26):**  strike three things in one stroke.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:25:28):**  And seeds is an opportunity really to improve the pleasure of food, the nutrition of food  
**[0:25:33-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:25:33):**  and the environment all in one little seed.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:25:36):**  And that's why I really started the company was the potential of it.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:25:39):**  Today nearly 65% of the future of our food supply, which is seeds is in the hands of  
**[0:25:45-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:25:45):**  four companies.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:25:46):**  Four.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:25:47):**  50 years ago, there were 10,000 companies and most seeds were traded.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:25:51):**  They were not sold.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:25:52):**  Today, four companies over 60, it's between 60 and 65%.  
**[0:25:57-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:25:57):**  That's depressing.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:25:58):**  I want to add one more level of depression.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:26:01):**  The four companies that own nearly 65% of our food supply are all chemical companies.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:26:07):**  They are not seed companies.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:26:08):**  They own seed companies.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:26:09):**  They own multiple seed companies.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:26:12):**  But their overarching company is chemical companies and is a chemical company, is a  
**[0:26:18-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:26:18):**  multinational chemical company.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:26:19):**  So that means that they are selecting and breeding seeds that are meant for a chemical  
**[0:26:28-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:26:28):**  intervention, a pesticide or a fertilizer or an herbicide.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:26:32):**  And definitely not something that takes nitrogen out of the air by itself.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:26:36):**  Why?  
**[0:26:37-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:26:37):**  They wouldn't make money.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:26:38):**  They wouldn't make money.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:26:39):**  So they make their money with the intervention.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:26:41):**  And that if I was an investor, I'd get the hell away from that because that's not going  
**[0:26:44-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:26:44):**  to last.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:26:46):**  And do you see that since you started, have you seen any other signs?  
**[0:26:50-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:26:50):**  I want to end on a high note.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:26:51):**  These are not super depressing.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:26:54):**  You've been working on this for a while.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:26:55):**  Have you seen any other small early signs?  
**[0:26:57-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:26:57):**  Just as I mean, we started looking at soil and you see things.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:27:00):**  Have you seen the same excitement starting in seeds?  
**[0:27:04-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:27:04):**  Yeah, I do.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:27:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:27:06):**  People like you, people like you who are asking these kinds of questions.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:27:09):**  I do.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:27:10):**  I see a lot of people asking these kinds of questions of this is not right.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:27:14):**  We're not headed in the right direction.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:27:15):**  And are we forgetting the wisdom of the past and marrying that wisdom with potential technologies  
**[0:27:21-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:27:21):**  that can truly bring us more delicious and nutritious food?  
**[0:27:25-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:27:25):**  It's very possible.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:27:26):**  It's there.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:27:27):**  And so people like you, people like scientists like Jill Clappert and there are breeders  
**[0:27:31-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:27:31):**  who I'm talking to almost every day who are out there coming out of the woodwork.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:27:35):**  So there is a definite and then there's young people.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:27:38):**  There's young people in America anyway.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:27:39):**  I don't know as much about the rest of the world.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:27:42):**  There is just a swelling of interest, enthusiasm, and a refugia.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:27:47):**  They're the refugia movement.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:27:48):**  They will not take food from a highly processed food companies.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:27:53):**  There's a wholesale rejection of it actually.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:27:56):**  And when you talk to these food company executives, which I do, you hear from them very clearly  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:28:02):**  say.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:28:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:28:04):**  We had Nestle on that clearly was scared because they started changing, literally changing  
**[0:28:09-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:28:09):**  in the last two years their buying habits.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:28:12):**  It's everywhere.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:28:13):**  And all of them are saying, if we're going to be in business in 10 years, we need to  
**[0:28:17-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:28:17):**  really change course.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:28:19):**  And the system is not built to change course quickly.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:28:22):**  So it's going to be very challenging.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:28:23):**  But I think the groundswell of attention that's happening is happening because on younger  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:28:29):**  people and I think it's being driven by pleasure and taste.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:28:33):**  It's not just people wanting to save the environment because I don't think at the end of the day  
**[0:28:36-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:28:36):**  that drives enough people.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:28:38):**  It's enough.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:28:39):**  No, it's not.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:28:40):**  It's the pleasure that you get from really good food and people are willing to spend  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:28:43):**  a little more for it, but unwilling to support the companies that don't support that.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:28:47):**  If I were an investor, just from a brand perspective, I would not be heavily investing in a company  
**[0:28:53-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:28:53):**  that is not focused on that next generation.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:28:56):**  Because once this generation that I'm talking about has kids, forget it.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:29:00):**  I mean, you think it's bad, you think it's interesting now.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:29:03):**  It'll be really interesting when they have kids.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:29:05):**  You know, once you have kids, you're so conscious of what you're eating and what they're eating.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:29:09):**  And it's another ballgame.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:29:11):**  So I do actually, you know, I'm pretty cynical about everything.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:29:14):**  I feel very positive about the future of where food could go.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:29:18):**  To your point, I hope it happens quickly enough.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:29:20):**  Thank you so much.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:29:21):**  I know you need to run.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:29:22):**  I will wrap up.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:29:23):**  Thank you, man.

**[0:32:06-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:32:06):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:32:08):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:32:13):**  So risky how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:32:19-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:32:19):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find

**[0:32:39-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:32:39):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:32:41):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:32:44):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-barber#t=0:32:47):**  It's also not investment advice.

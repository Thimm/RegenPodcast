**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:00:14):**  Food security is not a sprint, but a marathon.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:00:16):**  In this episode, we dive into the story of how a small 30-year-old sustainable input  
**[0:00:20-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:00:20):**  company from Australia is helping to shape the future of agriculture in China.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:00:27):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:32-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:00:32):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:00:33):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:37-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:00:37):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:00:43):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:00:47):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:49-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:00:49):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:00:53):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat, and it's time that we as investors, big and  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:00:58):**  small and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath  
**[0:01:03-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:01:03):**  our feet.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:01:05):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:09-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:01:09):**  our work.

**[0:01:29-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:01:29):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:01:31):**  Welcome to another episode of the podcast today with the CEO of VRM Biologic, Kelly  
**[0:01:37-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:01:37):**  Walters.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:01:38):**  Welcome, Kelly.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:01:39):**  Thanks for having me, Cohen.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:01:41):**  So we're going to unpack a lot of things in this podcast.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:01:43):**  I'm really much looking forward, but can you first give a bit of background on yourself  
**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:01:48):**  and why you ended up working so much on and in soil?  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:01:51):**  Sure.  
**[0:01:52-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:01:52):**  Well, from the VRM Biologic perspective, our founder, Ken Bellamy, he started work about  
**[0:02:00-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:02:00):**  30 years ago looking for simple solutions for addressing issues that were facing the  
**[0:02:09-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:02:09):**  environment basically.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:02:11):**  The particular ones that he was looking at were things like declining soil fertility,  
**[0:02:15-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:02:15):**  a lack of available protein, advancing fungal domination and limitation in nutrient levels  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:02:23):**  required to sustain agriculture across the globe.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:02:27):**  In short, the capacity for the global population to feed itself he saw as a real problem that  
**[0:02:34-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:02:34):**  was commencing at that point in time, so the late 90s, and was only going to exacerbate  
**[0:02:40-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:02:40):**  unless somebody did something about it.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:02:42):**  Personally, my drive to work in the environment started at university trying to determine  
**[0:02:49-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:02:49):**  what to do as a career and opted to really work in a field that would allow me to balance  
**[0:02:57-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:02:57):**  human need with environmental need.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:03:00):**  So over time, I worked in a number of different places and came to VRM nearly 10 years ago.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:03:07):**  The entire ethos of the company, I think, was the biggest thing I could see a massive  
**[0:03:13-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:03:13):**  problem.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:03:14):**  At the time that I started, there was still only concentration on water resources and  
**[0:03:19-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:03:19):**  air resources.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:03:20):**  There was the commencement of the discussion around carbon and there was no real emphasis  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:03:27):**  on what was going to happen with food security.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:03:30):**  It felt like we were preparing ourselves for what was inevitably going to come in the future.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:03:36):**  It's fascinating if you look back 10 years ago, soil and carbon and even biodiversity  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:03:43):**  and nutrients, I feel like, but probably we can do some Google search and Google Trends  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:03:48):**  search to see how much it exploded over the last years.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:03:51):**  But I feel like the last years have been an enormous wave.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:03:54):**  Obviously, my bubble has grown, but an enormous wave of interest for that, luckily, because  
**[0:03:59-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:03:59):**  it's such a fundamental piece.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:04:01):**  So what does VRM do and what do you provide to farmers, to land stewards and also to other  
**[0:04:07-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:04:07):**  sectors but focusing on the agriculture part?  
**[0:04:09-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:04:09):**  The technology that we developed was really looking at a missing element in photosynthesis.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:04:16):**  And not too many people across the globe know that there is something called bacterial photosynthesis.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:04:22):**  It's really a process that occurs in biologically active soils that assists plants to undergo  
**[0:04:29-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:04:29):**  photosynthesis.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:04:30):**  So years ago, Ken looked very simply at the equations and determined that there was a  
**[0:04:37-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:04:37):**  missing key.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:04:38):**  What was that missing key?  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:04:40):**  And part of the exploration early on was looking at rainforests.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:04:45):**  What kind of processes happen in rainforest?  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:04:47):**  So nobody goes and applies a fertilizer in a rainforest.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:04:51):**  There are just complete balanced systems that operate.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:04:55):**  So what we sought to do was to replicate those in a very simple, easy, cost-effective way  
**[0:05:02-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:05:02):**  that farmers could use.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:05:04):**  So we have a number of products, but we also have a number of processes that farmers can  
**[0:05:09-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:05:09):**  use as a diversified manufacture approach to looking around their farm, getting whatever  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:05:16):**  biomass or organic residues exists and creating for themselves an agricultural input.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:05:22):**  So that's what we do across the world now.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:05:25):**  That's a fascinating thing to unpack further because often I see from input companies,  
**[0:05:29-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:05:29):**  they obviously want to sell the input, which is very secretive or comes in something that  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:05:35):**  you can obviously, you can apply and you have to keep buying because that's the business  
**[0:05:39-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:05:39):**  model.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:05:40):**  In this case, the process is very interesting because I see a lot of farmers in the region  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:05:43):**  X space and the advanced agro-ecology space that want to make things themselves or at  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:05:48):**  least see like, I need to use input that come from my farm or my biome or my landscape because  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:05:54):**  if I get it from very far, I just simply don't know the risks.  
**[0:05:58-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:05:58):**  So how does that process work?  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:05:59):**  I'm a farmer in Australia and the US, in China, we'll get to that in a second.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:06:04):**  And you sell me or license me a process.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:06:08):**  It does a big container show up or do I have to watch a lot of YouTube videos?  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:06:11):**  How does that work turning my biomass in something that helps this biological photosynthesis?  
**[0:06:16-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:06:16):**  So we have two processes.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:06:19):**  The one that is most easily implemented on farms is called the ground soil process.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:06:25):**  So this has been around for about 15 years now and what it rolls out to be is a static  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:06:33):**  fermentation approach to taking any kind of biomass that's existing on the farm.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:06:39):**  So it could be in a feedlot bedding material from the pens, manure, spent feed, grasses,  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:06:48):**  any kind of green waste that exists.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:06:51):**  There is a partnership, a paired formulation of products that's applied in a very minute  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:06:58):**  amount to that material and then the material is piled and left on the farm covered for  
**[0:07:04-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:07:04):**  six months.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:07:05):**  So at the end of that six month period, you have a really humus rich product, solid product  
**[0:07:13-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:07:13):**  that is then applied onto soil as you would any kind of solid agricultural import.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:07:20):**  And I need to keep using it as a form, like it's sort of a starter for the fermentation  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:07:26):**  if I'm correct.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:07:27):**  Like it's, it's a very specific, the right kind of fermentation I would like, not the  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:07:31):**  one that creates all kinds of, I mean, if you're making sourdough, you know, the ones  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:07:35):**  that take over your sourdough in a very smelly, not like let's say dark way instead of making  
**[0:07:40-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:07:40):**  a very nice bread.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:07:41):**  So you're supplying the ones that I need.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:07:44):**  Is that something that I keep buying or once let's say my farm is, or my soil is in transition  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:07:49):**  further enough, it makes sense to keep applying that every year or at some point I'm off it  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:07:55):**  and 10 years down the road, my soils are alive enough to do that photosynthesis, the biological  
**[0:08:00-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:08:00):**  photosynthesis themselves, or how does that work?  
**[0:08:02-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:08:02):**  Is it a transition input?  
**[0:08:04-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:08:04):**  Is that I think my question or is it a constant one?  
**[0:08:06-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:08:06):**  It is a transition input in that over time, once the soil is built to a certain level,  
**[0:08:13-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:08:13):**  you have ultimately increased its buffering capacity.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:08:16):**  So its resilience is there and over time you can reduce the amount of material that you  
**[0:08:22-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:08:22):**  need to apply on that soil.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:08:24):**  That's the productive soils though.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:08:26):**  If you're not actually using the soil, then it is basically a very quick process where  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:08:32):**  you restore the soil and are able to leave it, to leave it sit there.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:08:36):**  And in that case, you don't need to reapply.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:08:38):**  And so this started, I mean, this specific process you mentioned 15 years ago and Ken  
**[0:08:42-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:08:42):**  started more than 30 years ago.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:08:44):**  And how did China coming from Australia, obviously there are a lot of connections to China.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:08:49):**  You have a footprint in the US as well, but how did China come on the radar and not only  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:08:53):**  on the radar, but actually becoming part of the, an important part of the company?  
**[0:08:57-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:08:57):**  It's very interesting journey.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:09:00):**  That's why I'm asking.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:09:01):**  We've been on there.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:09:02):**  We actually had for many, many years since about 2009, 2010, a really good presence in  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:09:08):**  Malaysia, specifically in Penang Island.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:09:11):**  The other process that I was talking to you about, the bioregion process, is a way of  
**[0:09:16-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:09:16):**  taking putrescent organic materials to things like food waste and converting that into a  
**[0:09:22-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:09:22):**  liquid bio fertilizer.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:09:24):**  So that was something that we worked in tandem with the Penang state government to roll out  
**[0:09:29-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:09:29):**  across the island.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:09:31):**  So in about 2013, the Malaysian government opted to introduce us to the Chinese government  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:09:40):**  via the Malaysian consulate in China.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:09:43):**  So our very first trip was over to Guangzhou and we went on behalf of the Malaysian government.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:09:51):**  And why did they do that?  
**[0:09:52-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:09:52):**  What was the like, Oh, we think China are a big neighbor can use this as well.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:09:56):**  Or what did they see just as a nice neighbor, a nice introduction as we do in neighborhoods?  
**[0:10:02-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:10:02):**  What happened there?  
**[0:10:03-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:10:03):**  Well, very much, we developed a strong relationship with Penang Island and with the ministries  
**[0:10:11-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:10:11):**  there and also with the local governments.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:10:13):**  Over time, we're able to solve for them what is normally an intractable problem.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:10:18):**  And for a long time, they were rated in the top 10 regions for processing waste in a sustainable  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:10:26):**  way by the International Solid Waste Association.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:10:30):**  There's also a very big presence that they have in the UNEP program.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:10:35):**  So very strong UN connections.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:10:38):**  So in part, it was them saying that there was validity and there was something extra  
**[0:10:44-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:10:44):**  special about what we could present.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:10:47):**  And it dovetailed nicely with what the demand is for in China.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:10:53):**  And then what happened, your first trip was there.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:10:56):**  And I think many might have a first trip somewhere, they get some connections and then it sort  
**[0:11:01-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:11:01):**  of fizzles or doesn't lead to anything.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:11:03):**  In this case, it went differently.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:11:05):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:11:06):**  Persistence, Cohen.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:11:08):**  That's what we needed.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:11:09):**  So that was 2013 and we developed some really great relationships with some state-owned  
**[0:11:17-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:11:17):**  enterprises but also some other contacts within the country.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:11:21):**  And from there, there was a gradual rollout, an incremental rollout based on state-owned  
**[0:11:28-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:11:28):**  enterprises deciding that they were going to utilize our technology and then piloting  
**[0:11:34-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:11:34):**  that in a variety of ways with us.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:11:37):**  There was market testing that went on, so smaller distributors that were brought on  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:11:42):**  board and went out into the communities to determine whether this was something that  
**[0:11:48-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:11:48):**  was feasible or not.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:11:49):**  And then the final act was us partnering with five state-owned enterprises to form one organization  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:11:59):**  that we now have a small shareholding in.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:12:03):**  And the idea is to restore their capacity to be able to feed their people.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:12:10):**  And what is the current, it might be a very big question, but the current status of agriculture  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:12:14):**  in China, I don't read a lot about it except whatever gets in the news here, which is obviously  
**[0:12:19-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:12:19):**  very colored.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:12:20):**  But what do you see as the current status of that and why are they so interested in  
**[0:12:26-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:12:26):**  restoring?  
**[0:12:27-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:12:27):**  Like, are they ahead of the curve in terms of regeneration and restoration?  
**[0:12:30-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:12:30):**  Are they ahead of the curve?  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:12:31):**  Are they seeing what's coming?  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:12:33):**  What do you feel there as you have spent a lot of time in agriculture in China?  
**[0:12:37-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:12:37):**  Yeah, in total, I, with my family, lived in Singapore for two years, so did it deliberately  
**[0:12:45-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:12:45):**  so that I could travel very easily in and around that area, Southeast Asia in total.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:12:52):**  China is very progressive with regard to what they're doing in agriculture.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:12:56):**  So in 2020, they made a policy determination that they were not going to be using any additional  
**[0:13:04-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:13:04):**  synthetic fertilizer.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:13:06):**  Which means from that moment on, it had to stay or go down.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:13:11):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:13:12):**  The total quantity, which is a lot.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:13:15):**  Yes, that's exactly right.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:13:16):**  And which is quite an impressive declaration to make.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:13:21):**  As a consequence of that, they had to find organic sources.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:13:24):**  And that's why they came to us.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:13:26):**  They saw that it was a perfect fit for what the direction of the company, a country needed  
**[0:13:31-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:13:31):**  to go in.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:13:33):**  And the policy framework that has been established since then is very supportive and very sympathetic  
**[0:13:39-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:13:39):**  towards what we're trying to achieve.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:13:41):**  So we're seeing, they're sort of like in some other places, especially around, I think,  
**[0:13:46-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:13:46):**  electric cars, renewable energy, et cetera.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:13:48):**  They're definitely leading the pack.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:13:50):**  Would you say they're doing the same in agriculture and especially, let's say, tackling the input  
**[0:13:55-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:13:55):**  issues or the input challenges and barriers around that?  
**[0:13:58-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:13:58):**  They very definitely are.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:14:00):**  And they're also seeing that there is a great opportunity presented in utilizing the feedstock,  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:14:07):**  the organic residues that they have.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:14:09):**  They're looking specifically at being able to build regional circular economies.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:14:15):**  And they're doing it on a grand scale.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:14:17):**  Yeah, of course.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:14:18):**  It's very impressive and it is also something that exists as an example for the rest of  
**[0:14:23-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:14:23):**  the world.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:14:24):**  What has happened since you forming that partnership or that company where you have a minority  
**[0:14:28-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:14:28):**  stake in?  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:14:29):**  What has since happened as there were very challenging times in China, obviously globally  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:14:34):**  with the pandemic as well, and also politically?  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:14:37):**  Has it been smooth sailing since then or what has happened since then?  
**[0:14:42-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:14:42):**  It really has.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:14:43):**  The political side of things we prefer to leave to the politicians.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:14:47):**  The pandemic has had a massive impact on us being able to travel and actually do face  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:14:53):**  to face business.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:14:54):**  So ordinarily we would be over there every two weeks.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:14:58):**  But it has been somewhat frustrating that we haven't been able to leave our shores to  
**[0:15:04-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:15:04):**  be able to go over.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:15:06):**  But we have really exercised the full potential of remote learning and remote training.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:15:13):**  We have three key staff over there already that work within the organization and have  
**[0:15:20-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:15:20):**  been working with us for a long time.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:15:22):**  So it's relatively easy to be able to communicate through them.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:15:27):**  They're well attuned to what needs to be done over there.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:15:31):**  And there's an impetus because everybody just wants to get the job done.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:15:34):**  So in many ways, the pandemic has actually just allowed us to be a little bit more creative  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:15:41):**  in terms of how we continue to build that relationship.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:15:45):**  And less hours spent on flights, that's for sure.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:15:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:15:49):**  And less environmental impact in terms of travel.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:15:53):**  It's less jetlags and other negative effects of flying so much.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:15:58):**  What are you supplying to that partnership or through the partnership?  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:16:02):**  What process are you setting the processes, the inputs, and what is currently being applied  
**[0:16:07-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:16:07):**  and where is it applied?  
**[0:16:09-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:16:09):**  What kind of types of agriculture?  
**[0:16:11-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:16:11):**  And obviously I'm interested in scale.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:16:13):**  Could a relatively small company from Australia really have a meaningful impact in terms of  
**[0:16:19-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:16:19):**  hectares or acres in China?  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:16:20):**  I'm very interested to unpack that as well.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:16:23):**  We supplied a license to the organization over there.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:16:28):**  So they have become the national manufacturing entity.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:16:31):**  So they are in essence a carbon copy of us over in China.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:16:37):**  So with that comes the training around being able to develop the products from base products.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:16:44):**  And we, which was quite interesting, sent 32 full 20-foot shipping containers out of  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:16:51):**  Townsville Port, which is in North Queensland.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:16:55):**  And it was a spectacle.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:16:57):**  There were a lot of people standing there going, this is massive.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:17:00):**  This is huge.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:17:01):**  So we were able to have all of that material go over there.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:17:06):**  So they, as an organization, are licensed to not only manufacture the products, but  
**[0:17:11-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:17:11):**  to utilize the processes I was talking to you about before.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:17:15):**  VRM, as a global mission, is looking to restore 25% of the world's arable land over 25 years,  
**[0:17:25-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:17:25):**  starting last year.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:17:27):**  So this move into China through this tranche is addressing 20 million acres.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:17:34):**  So it's about 0.67% of where we want to be going to.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:17:40):**  So it's small, I suppose, but if you look at that scale, 20 million acres is pretty  
**[0:17:45-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:17:45):**  impressive.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:17:46):**  They're using it in the center of China, so in Shanxi province.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:17:54):**  And then they're utilizing it for crops that are basically food crops.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:17:59):**  We've got a lot of activity going on in corn, leafy greens, cucumbers, tomatoes, strawberries,  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:18:08):**  watermelon, really nutrient dense food, which is fantastic for us to see.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:18:14):**  And also things like peony seeds, which is both a fuel crop and also something that's  
**[0:18:19-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:18:19):**  integral in their diet.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:18:21):**  So there's a large variety of things that we're doing over there.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:18:25):**  And we're also assisting in terms of the animal husbandry industry.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:18:30):**  So utilizing a lot of the manures that come out of the chicken industries, either poultry  
**[0:18:37-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:18:37):**  or layers, and also a lot of the piggeries over there.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:18:41):**  We're utilizing the products in there as well.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:18:44):**  So overall, we're looking to do that ecosystem balance on smaller scale, regional scale,  
**[0:18:50-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:18:50):**  national scale.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:18:53):**  What can we learn as, let's say in the West, which is not the right term, what can we learn  
**[0:18:57-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:18:57):**  in other countries from the approach you've seen Chinese policymakers, but also obviously  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:19:05):**  the state owned companies, et cetera, make in terms of food security, in terms of regional  
**[0:19:10-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:19:10):**  circular systems, what's there for us to take away?  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:19:13):**  The biggest takeaway for me is the focus on the future.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:19:18):**  So the planning that seems to occur seems to be very scattergun, I suppose, in its approach  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:19:24):**  generally and very short term, very myopic in thinking.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:19:28):**  So what we have seen is a longer term approach taken and the understanding that there needs  
**[0:19:35-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:19:35):**  to be incremental change implemented and built upon in order for there to be a larger scale  
**[0:19:41-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:19:41):**  change in the long term.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:19:44):**  So food security isn't a sprint, it's a marathon.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:19:48):**  So we really need to be addressing it in that way.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:19:51):**  And I think what China has done from a policy perspective is something that we could all  
**[0:19:56-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:19:56):**  definitely learn from.  
**[0:19:57-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:19:57):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:19:58):**  And then more on the finance or investment side of things, with the lessons you've seen  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:20:05):**  and you've learned so far, what would you tell, let's presume they're smart impact investors  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:20:11):**  listening to this podcast, what would you not advise them because we're not giving investment  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:20:15):**  advice, but what would you tell them to focus on if they're saying, I'm extremely ready  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:20:20):**  to step into the regenerative space, what excites you the most in terms of niches or  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:20:26):**  peak pieces where activity is needed from your side of things?  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:20:30):**  Is it focused on regions where not so much is happening yet, or it seems like it, maybe  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:20:34):**  Malaysia, maybe Indonesia, maybe Southeast Asia, et cetera, or focus on the technology  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:20:39):**  piece or what would you tell investors that want to get active in this space?  
**[0:20:43-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:20:43):**  I suppose there's a three-pronged approach to what I would do and what I would suggest.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:20:49):**  And if I had a billion dollars in my back pocket, this is certainly what I'd be doing  
**[0:20:53-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:20:53):**  with it.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:20:54):**  You're taking my next question.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:20:55):**  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:20:56):**  Sorry.  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:20:57):**  No, don't worry, don't worry.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:20:58):**  It's both, I mean, both what you would tell other investors, but it's a very good point  
**[0:21:02-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:21:02):**  because at the end of the day, I always ask that question, what would you do, which is  
**[0:21:05-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:21:05):**  much more revealing.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:21:06):**  So actually let's jump to that one.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:21:07):**  If you had a billion dollars as an investment fund, what would you focus on having seen,  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:21:11):**  let's say the state of degradation for sure in China, in Australia, in Malaysia and many  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:21:17):**  other places you work and having also seen the potential with a very small, still with  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:21:22):**  a lot of respect, but a very small company could achieve, what would you focus on with  
**[0:21:26-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:21:26):**  a billion dollars?  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:21:27):**  First and foremost, I would look to the areas where there is significant degradation in  
**[0:21:33-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:21:33):**  agricultural land.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:21:35):**  And if you have a look, there's a very stark image produced by the Food and Agriculture  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:21:41):**  Organization that shows very clearly what the state of soil is across the globe.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:21:46):**  So you would go to the worst areas.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:21:49):**  Worst areas.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:21:50):**  Because you can see the potential because that's where it's most needed or where it's  
**[0:21:54-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:21:54):**  most difficult potentially as well?  
**[0:21:56-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:21:56):**  Both or three.  
**[0:21:57-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:21:57):**  It's not the easiest areas.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:21:59):**  No, they're certainly the most difficult areas, but what we'd like to do is achieve the replenishment  
**[0:22:06-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:22:06):**  of the soil in those areas.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:22:08):**  And while I haven't done the in-depth research, the correspondence of those areas with where  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:22:15):**  the food is most needed in the globe is, yeah.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:22:19):**  It's just a direct line between the two of them, basically.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:22:23):**  So you wouldn't go to the places where you can make things incrementally a bit better,  
**[0:22:30-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:22:30):**  but probably easier because the soils are still in an okayish state.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:22:33):**  No, it would go to the worst hit areas because there, and probably you're absolutely right,  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:22:39):**  there's where food security is also the biggest issue.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:22:43):**  And thus you can save a lot of transport costs later on bringing food from other places and  
**[0:22:47-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:22:47):**  having the biggest impact there.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:22:49):**  Very interesting, but probably not the easiest approach.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:22:52):**  Probably not.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:22:53):**  No, we would have to have a whole lot of friends come along and assist us, that's for certain.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:22:58):**  But the diversified location of those kinds of activities would start to build that global  
**[0:23:06-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:23:06):**  picture very quickly.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:23:08):**  The next thing I would do would be to fund the development of these regional circular  
**[0:23:14-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:23:14):**  economy systems so that everybody benefits from an economic and an environmental and  
**[0:23:21-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:23:21):**  a social perspective.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:23:23):**  Everybody benefits from the circulation of money and the increase in the quality of everything.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:23:30):**  So we're looking at abundance, we're looking at creating abundance.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:23:34):**  And the farmer themselves, that's where the abundance needs to start in order to ensure  
**[0:23:41-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:23:41):**  that any kind of behaviour change is sustained.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:23:44):**  But the last element that I would do would be looking at education and training.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:23:51):**  So one of the key activities that we're engaged in at the moment is identifying a specific  
**[0:23:57-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:23:57):**  list of what do you do if you want to be implementing practices on your land that are regenerative,  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:24:05):**  what are they and how do you go about them and how do you cost whether they're appropriate  
**[0:24:10-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:24:10):**  for you or not.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:24:11):**  So there's a program, for example, in Australia called Cultivate Farms that we strongly support.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:24:18):**  They take young farmers, train them in how to implement these practices, but also how  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:24:25):**  to run a farm business and how to be investment ready when people come along with wodges of  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:24:30):**  money just ready to invest in the future of farming.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:24:35):**  So I think all of those three would be my favourite approaches.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:24:39):**  And you talked about abundance.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:24:41):**  Do you see that switching the mindset from scarcity to abundance, which I think could  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:24:47):**  be an absolutely fundamental one, like we could definitely grow even in very degraded  
**[0:24:52-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:24:52):**  lands, we can grow a lot.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:24:53):**  A lot can be grown if we manage it differently.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:24:56):**  But I also noticed that a lot of people sort of take the status quo as the status quo.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:25:01):**  Like this is how the land should look, this is how the land always had looked and this  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:25:04):**  is what it could produce and thus we cannot change.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:25:07):**  Do you notice that a lot and if so, how do you overcome that or are the farmers that  
**[0:25:11-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:25:11):**  reach out to you already, let's say, on the train of abundance and want to get tools to  
**[0:25:16-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:25:16):**  get the job done?  
**[0:25:17-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:25:17):**  Or do you get a lot of resistance when you say we can actually produce here X and Y or  
**[0:25:21-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:25:21):**  we can produce, there's so much more potential and everybody's like, yeah, but the drive  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:25:24):**  will never, or this land will never sustain that because like, well, how do you overcome  
**[0:25:29-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:25:29):**  the scarcity mindset into abundance?  
**[0:25:31-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:25:31):**  There's very definitely a lot of that.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:25:33):**  We hear all the time, for example, yeah, that works there, but it won't work here.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:25:39):**  What do you say then?  
**[0:25:40-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:25:40):**  Like, what do you say when somebody says that?  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:25:42):**  Because I hear it a lot as well.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:25:43):**  And I obviously, as I'm not the farmer on that piece of land, nobody can guarantee it  
**[0:25:48-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:25:48):**  works, but very likely those approaches, if they work at many places, they could also  
**[0:25:53-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:25:53):**  work at your place.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:25:54):**  Like what do you say when somebody says that that's another piece of land or they have  
**[0:25:57-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:25:57):**  another climate or another soil?  
**[0:25:58-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:25:58):**  The best way to overcome that is to have a wide diversity of here is where we've done  
**[0:26:05-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:26:05):**  it previously.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:26:06):**  Yeah, that's exactly right.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:26:08):**  There's a lot of social proof that people are looking for and we are always very willing  
**[0:26:14-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:26:14):**  and we have wonderful clients that we've worked with for a very long time and they have converted  
**[0:26:21-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:26:21):**  over the years to being advocates.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:26:23):**  So are very generous in terms of donating their time to discuss what the change has  
**[0:26:29-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:26:29):**  been for them.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:26:31):**  So we're very lucky in that respect.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:26:34):**  But part of what we did, the pandemic allowed us a little bit of time to sit and reflect  
**[0:26:40-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:26:40):**  and think.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:26:41):**  And one of the things that we looked at was, okay, what mechanism can we put in place to  
**[0:26:47-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:26:47):**  encourage abundance, to start to really design a mindset that farmers can step into that  
**[0:26:56-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:26:56):**  is much more a comfortable place to be than the scarcity, the drought is always going  
**[0:27:02-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:27:02):**  to be here, there's nothing I can do to change.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:27:05):**  So we developed during that time, VRM did the Agricultural Abundance Program.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:27:11):**  So that's been running since June 2020.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:27:16):**  And the whole point of that is to form alliances of farmers who are looking to transition or  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:27:23):**  who are looking for that kind of support to be able to implement regenerative practices  
**[0:27:28-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:27:28):**  on their land.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:27:30):**  And we've seen, we had a little bit of a hiatus.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:27:33):**  It was an interesting time for farmers towards the end of 2020.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:27:38):**  But what we've seen is a big take up now, most recently over the past couple of months  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:27:44):**  by people who are really getting on board and really going, yeah, we don't want to be  
**[0:27:49-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:27:49):**  a part of this negativity anymore.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:27:51):**  We really want to look to the future and we really want to look to how we can help ourselves.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:27:56):**  Would it mean that if you go into, let's say, like you're running the 1 billion investment  
**[0:28:03-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:28:03):**  fund again, you go into the most severely degraded places on earth, would you look for  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:28:08):**  that one example or would you try to create a one example?  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:28:12):**  So at least there's somewhere to point to.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:28:15):**  Where would you start then?  
**[0:28:16-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:28:16):**  Because probably that whole area is in scarcity mindset, rightfully so, because it seems like  
**[0:28:21-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:28:21):**  an ecosystem is degrading and everything seems to be going down when that happens.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:28:25):**  So what would you do?  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:28:26):**  It is very theoretical, obviously, but what would you do to flip that, to flip the conversation  
**[0:28:31-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:28:31):**  in that case?  
**[0:28:32-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:28:32):**  Would you finance a pilot program?  
**[0:28:34-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:28:34):**  Would you buy some land and show what's possible?  
**[0:28:36-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:28:36):**  What would be your approach?  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:28:37):**  Yes, the pilot program has been the approach that we've taken everywhere.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:28:42):**  So our standard process is to go to a place and find the champion, find the individual  
**[0:28:49-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:28:49):**  or the company who understands entirely what we're about and is willing to pioneer that  
**[0:28:55-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:28:55):**  approach in their area or even in their country.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:28:58):**  It's what we've done in China, it's what we've done in the US and we're very lucky in Australia  
**[0:29:04-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:29:04):**  we have a number of those champions.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:29:06):**  And do you always find them?  
**[0:29:08-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:29:08):**  Even if you don't, do you always find a pioneer?  
**[0:29:11-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:29:11):**  Everybody that we've dealt with, yes.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:29:13):**  Yes, they've always been pioneers and it's interesting reflecting on them.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:29:18):**  People can see case studies on our website, videos on our website.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:29:21):**  The people that we're lucky enough to engage with, leaders in their own industries.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:29:26):**  So they are very influential and they are trustworthy.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:29:31):**  People understand what they say, when they say it and believe, okay, if they're doing  
**[0:29:37-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:29:37):**  it, then it must be okay.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:29:39):**  It must be safe and it must be effective and I'm looking at their results and I'm getting  
**[0:29:43-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:29:43):**  on board too.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:29:44):**  Does it take time?  
**[0:29:46-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:29:46):**  I mean, of course it does, but to build a trust with them because they must be approached  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:29:50):**  by many companies promising the moon and the stars and everything in between.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:29:55):**  And so how you must have a very long patience line to build up trust with pioneers like  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:30:02):**  that that also don't want to risk their name, their status, et cetera, by promoting something  
**[0:30:06-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:30:06):**  or being an ambassador or being positive about something that they don't know really well.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:30:11):**  Like they need to know it really in and out and need to work potentially with it for 10  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:30:15):**  years before they start sharing it in their community, which from a business perspective  
**[0:30:20-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:30:20):**  might be challenging for you.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:30:22):**  Some of them are like that.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:30:24):**  Some of them want to work with it.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:30:26):**  They want to know the ins and outs.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:30:28):**  They will spend 10, 15 years applying the techniques and looking at it and asking questions.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:30:38):**  And yeah, some though, early adopters jump on board.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:30:42):**  So we have some people who come to us.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:30:45):**  I had a conversation just the other day with somebody who said after an hour, okay, yep,  
**[0:30:51-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:30:51):**  let's do it.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:30:52):**  Let's go.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:30:53):**  What is the pilot part of his or her farm I'm imagining or on the full one?  
**[0:30:57-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:30:57):**  An initial small pilot with the groundswell process is a really great introduction.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:31:02):**  It's quite easy to do and people can see the results quite quickly.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:31:06):**  So that's a really good entree into this is one of the multitude of things that you can  
**[0:31:12-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:31:12):**  do on land.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:31:13):**  A lot of the people that we work with though do commence like that, build quite quickly  
**[0:31:19-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:31:19):**  and then over time look to what's going on.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:31:21):**  But as I said, this is not a sprint, it's a marathon.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:31:25):**  The long-term relationships are key to building a business that's going to last and it's going  
**[0:31:31-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:31:31):**  to be effective in its mission in the long run.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:31:35):**  And if you had a magic wand, so we took away your investment fund, unfortunately, but you  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:31:39):**  have the power to change one thing in the food and agriculture space overnight.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:31:44):**  What would that be?  
**[0:31:45-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:31:45):**  I think it would be skepticism.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:31:49):**  I would immediately release the agricultural world from skepticism and give them the confidence  
**[0:31:56-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:31:56):**  to be able to change something new, given that there is a likelihood that it is going  
**[0:32:00-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:32:00):**  to make their lives better.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:32:03):**  It's going to make their farms functional, operational, profitable and sustainable.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:32:09):**  The level of skepticism across the globe, and it's not restricted to agriculture at  
**[0:32:14-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:32:14):**  all but...  
**[0:32:15-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:32:15):**  I would like to extend it beyond ACK if I could influence your magic power, but yeah,  
**[0:32:19-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:32:19):**  no, it's a very good point.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:32:21):**  Yeah, I would like to encourage people to have a go, to be open to the opportunity and  
**[0:32:30-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:32:30):**  the possibility of being able to do something different and have it work.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:32:34):**  And what is up for you, let's say the next 12 months?  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:32:38):**  Obviously these are crazy years and don't know if you can travel or not, but looking  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:32:43):**  at the program and the progress in the company in China, what are exciting things you look  
**[0:32:48-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:32:48):**  forward to over the next 12 months?  
**[0:32:50-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:32:50):**  What's going to happen?  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:32:51):**  But if we talk in a year from now, we're not talking October 2021, what would be, or could  
**[0:32:56-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:32:56):**  we be discussing?  
**[0:32:58-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:32:58):**  It's funny that you say travel because there is every now and then a beacon that is set  
**[0:33:04-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:33:04):**  up.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:33:05):**  Yes, shortly you might be able to travel overseas.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:33:07):**  So I am hanging on that opportunity.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:33:11):**  The conversations that we are having in China, continuing building very quickly in the US  
**[0:33:17-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:33:17):**  and also in Australia, the next 12 months are going to be out of this world in terms  
**[0:33:22-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:33:22):**  of what we're going to be able to do.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:33:23):**  There are a whole lot of people coming to us to talk about what we do and realising  
**[0:33:30-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:33:30):**  the potential of that.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:33:31):**  Geez, I would love to travel.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:33:34):**  But anticipating, and let's be positive about this, that borders do open and that we can  
**[0:33:39-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:33:39):**  freely move, I think that there's going to be a lot of presence of VRM into the US and  
**[0:33:46-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:33:46):**  there's going to be a significant shift towards that 25 and 25 goal achieved in the next 12  
**[0:33:54-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:33:54):**  months.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:33:55):**  And why do you think now that the US is shifting or is more ready to shift, let's phrase it  
**[0:34:01-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:34:01):**  differently?  
**[0:34:02-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:34:02):**  Why now, as investors always like to ask?  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:34:04):**  The opportunity market-wise is there.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:34:08):**  VRM has a very distinct offering when compared to a lot of what are perceived to be people  
**[0:34:16-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:34:16):**  in the similar field in the US in particular.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:34:20):**  And what I'm finding is that people are waking up to the opportunity that we present.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:34:26):**  It's funny in that a lot of the discussions that I've been having recently have been around  
**[0:34:32-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:34:32):**  an overnight success 30 years in the making.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:34:34):**  So we were at some point in time going to hit that tipping point.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:34:38):**  And I think we've reached it now.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:34:40):**  I'm very much looking forward to checking in in a year from now and seeing what has  
**[0:34:44-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:34:44):**  happened, hopefully with some travel at least.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:34:47):**  And I want to thank you so much, Kelly, for taking the time and sharing not only in China,  
**[0:34:51-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:34:51):**  but in general, on the input story that we don't cover enough on this podcast.

**[0:36:00-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:36:00):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils, and I've been following the space since 2011  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:36:05):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:37:07-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:37:07):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:37:11):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:37:16-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:37:16):**  different means.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:37:17):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to

**[0:37:27-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:37:27):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:37:33):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:37:35):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:37:40-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:37:40):**  is so risky.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:37:41):**  How to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to invest  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:37:46):**  in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find if  
**[0:37:50-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:37:50):**  you're a soil builder.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:37:52):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:37:57-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:37:57):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:38:01):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:38:05):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:38:06-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:38:06):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:38:08):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:38:11):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:38:14):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kellie-walters#t=0:38:17):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

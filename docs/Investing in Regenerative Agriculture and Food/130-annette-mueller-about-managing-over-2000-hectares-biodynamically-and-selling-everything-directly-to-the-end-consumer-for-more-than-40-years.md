**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:00:13):**  The extreme power of direct-to-consumer.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:00:16):**  How one of the largest biodynamic farms in Europe is managing over 2000 hectares of vineyards,  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:00:21):**  olives, pastures, grain and vegetables and processes everything before selling it directly  
**[0:00:26-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:00:26):**  to their end consumer.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:00:28):**  No middlemen, no shops, fully vertically integrated.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:00:34):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:00:38):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:00:40):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:00:44):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:00:49):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:00:54):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:00:56):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:00-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:01:00):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:01:03):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:01:07):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:01:12):**  In March last year we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:16-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:01:16):**  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.

**[0:01:36-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:01:36):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:01:38):**  So welcome to a new episode today with Annette Muller of La Villalla.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:01:41):**  We're here outside as you can hear.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:01:43):**  We're going to have some, I'm saying between brackets, background noise, but it's actually  
**[0:01:47-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:01:47):**  not noise.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:01:48):**  It's actually really nice to be on the farm, one of the largest biodynamic farms in Europe  
**[0:01:52-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:01:52):**  to hear more about the role of investing money and of course what has been built here over  
**[0:01:58-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:01:58):**  so many years.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:01:59):**  So welcome Annette.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:02:00):**  Hello, nice to be here.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:02:01):**  And to start with a personal question, how did you end up, first of all here we're in  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:02:05):**  Italy in Tuscany close to Arezzo and you're not from here, but how did you end up working  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:02:10):**  so closely to the soil, so closely to agriculture and food?  
**[0:02:14-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:02:14):**  So well, actually I moved here from Spain, from the Canary Islands and well it's a simple  
**[0:02:20-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:02:20):**  reason for love.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:02:22):**  My husband is Italian and that is the reason why we went back to Italy.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:02:27):**  Working for La Villalla, actually I love nature and for a long time I was working and was  
**[0:02:33-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:02:33):**  doing social work.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:02:34):**  I did meet the Lo Franco family.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:02:37):**  I just loved what they were doing and decided to be part of it.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:02:41):**  The Franco family, you mentioned them.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:02:44):**  What is La Villalla and if you had to describe it, which is tricky obviously in a few sentences,  
**[0:02:48-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:02:48):**  but what would you say where we are here?  
**[0:02:50-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:02:50):**  Hattoria La Villalla is a farm and wine estate.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:02:53):**  It's a biodynamic, family owned and family run farm in the middle of Tuscany.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:02:59):**  We're about 60 kilometers from Florence and about 10 kilometers from Arezzo.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:03:06):**  And it's really almost like a small, big world because we actually, I mean the way we farm  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:03:13):**  obviously in biodynamics we really have a whole circular economy in the sense that we  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:03:18):**  don't only have olive oil and wine, but we also produce vegetables.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:03:24):**  We also have sheep for the pecorino, for the sheep's cheese.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:03:29):**  And the other important thing is that we do everything ourselves in a sense.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:03:33):**  We grow everything and then we transform it and then we also sell it directly to the end  
**[0:03:38-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:03:38):**  consumer.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:03:39):**  And so we really always try to, while taking nature as an example really, to really try  
**[0:03:45-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:03:45):**  and close the circle.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:03:47):**  For example, we have sheep, which we obviously use for the milk, for the pecorino, but we  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:03:53):**  also need manure for our compost.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:03:56):**  We also have grains, so when we make our flowers, the remains, the brand that we don't use,  
**[0:04:01-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:04:01):**  we actually add to their feed.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:04:03):**  And always trying to look that we don't really produce any kind of waste.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:04:08):**  And obviously doing it in a regenerative way.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:04:11):**  You mentioned a lot of interesting things there to unpack, but the direct selling I  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:04:15):**  think is an absolutely crucial bit here as well, apart from closing the loops.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:04:19):**  And I think many people might have, or I hope some have visited Agritorismos, etc.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:04:24):**  But this is a very different scale.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:04:26):**  You're not a few hectares here and there making some cheeses and some wines and selling it  
**[0:04:31-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:04:31):**  in your, with all respect, farm shop.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:04:32):**  This is a different, what are we talking about in terms of hectares and in terms of people?  
**[0:04:38-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:04:38):**  We have almost 1,600 hectares.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:04:40):**  Well, actually a little more, including the forest.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:04:43):**  So we have almost 1,000 hectares just of forests.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:04:48):**  And we have over 300 hectares of wine.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:04:51):**  We have 400 hectares of olive trees, almost 40,000 plus minus olive trees.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:04:59):**  We have 800 hectares of fields for grains, vegetable patches, fruit.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:05:05):**  And I guess the one important aspect of it, the way it started, I mean, Fatuia La Vialla  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:05:10):**  was founded, this is now the second generation of Los Francos that is running Fatuia La Vialla.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:05:15):**  But when they started out, it actually simply started not with the idea to become this huge  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:05:22):**  farm and wine estate, but it actually started as a personal project.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:05:26):**  Their father, or their parents, Piero and Juliana Los Franco, wanted their children  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:05:31):**  over 40 years ago to have this idea of being close to nature.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:05:35):**  And so they bought a rundown farmhouse here in the hills around Arezzo and decided to  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:05:43):**  put it back into use with a small olive grove.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:05:46):**  They wanted to make some olive oil, maybe a little wine, vegetable patch.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:05:51):**  For mostly their own use.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:05:52):**  For their own use.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:05:53):**  And then what started as a hobby, they realized, oh, there's another field that has been abandoned.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:05:57):**  Oh, there's some sheep that nobody's taking care of.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:06:01):**  And so slowly La Vialla grew.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:06:03):**  And in the beginning, their idea was to sell the produce here in the area, but La Vialla  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:06:07):**  has always been organic.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:06:10):**  They've never done anything else.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:06:12):**  Started in 1978.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:06:15):**  And at the time, people were actually laughing at them here.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:06:18):**  So what they also did is they had some farmhouses, which they slowly renovated.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:06:23):**  And so people started coming to spend their vacation here.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:06:26):**  And those people came from all over Europe, mostly from Germany at that time.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:06:30):**  And so obviously there was a little bit of pecorino and a little bit of olive oil that  
**[0:06:34-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:06:34):**  the family was producing.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:06:36):**  And so the guests started saying, oh, but this Chianti is so wonderful.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:06:40):**  I would love to have that at my house.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:06:43):**  And so they actually started packing up a small van, getting the addresses of people  
**[0:06:48-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:06:48):**  that were interested and drove over the Alps and to Germany in that case, and delivered  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:06:54):**  by hand everything that they had produced and people had ordered.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:06:58):**  And so from there, it just organized itself in a way.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:07:02):**  So the direct-to-consumer started literally by people visiting here for a holiday, staying  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:07:08):**  in one of the farmhouses that happened to be on the land that they happened to be literally  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:07:13):**  renovating and the houses and then asking for stuff to be sent to them, things they  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:07:18):**  couldn't bring or when the harvest, probably they came in summer and then the wine harvest  
**[0:07:22-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:07:22):**  was later.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:07:23):**  So they wanted to have it shipped and almost accidentally.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:07:26):**  Now we are at a different scale.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:07:28):**  You have distribution centers in both Germany, the Netherlands and the UK, but still a lot  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:07:34):**  of people come here and visit, but a lot of people order and never come here and visit.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:07:38):**  So I mean the agriturismo where people can come and stay at the farm, we have 17 small  
**[0:07:44-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:07:44):**  farmsteads with 33 units where people can actually stay and spend their vacation.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:07:50):**  But obviously it's also a way for people to come visit.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:07:53):**  We have a transparent production area.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:07:55):**  People can actually visit the fields, they can see the olive mill, they can see the wine  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:08:00):**  cellar, they can taste the wine, they can get a feeling for La Viola.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:08:04):**  And it's still where the heart of Fattoria La Viola is, is actually that, you know, showing  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:08:08):**  people what we are doing and giving them an experience, which I think is really important.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:08:13):**  How many people work here now?  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:08:15):**  You mentioned the hectares, but it's a big company.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:08:18):**  Yes, we have over 150.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:08:21):**  And not just here.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:08:22):**  It's not one estate.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:08:23):**  It's not just here around Arendt.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:08:25):**  Also you are managing other pieces of land as well.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:08:26):**  Yes, what we started doing, because we also have a small foundation, the Lou Franco Family  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:08:30):**  Foundation, and its main aim is actually to find abandoned land that isn't being used  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:08:36):**  and to then try and lease it, sometimes maybe buy it, and then convert it to biodynamic  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:08:41):**  agriculture.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:08:42):**  Because you see there's more demand for what you're making, or is it both getting abandoned  
**[0:08:48-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:08:48):**  land back in production or you also see a growing demand of the produce?  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:08:51):**  Well, I think it's both in a way, it's really being able to restore the land.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:08:56):**  I mean, we do a lot of land restoration and in part that also includes using farmland  
**[0:09:01-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:09:01):**  that is just sitting there.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:09:03):**  And the other thing is obviously we also continue growing organically.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:09:07):**  So slowly, you know, we also need more fields to live for our products.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:09:12):**  What does the, because you said everybody thought they were crazy, which is something  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:09:16):**  we've heard many times on the podcast when people are changing farming practices, but  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:09:20):**  it was back in the day when they went organic or they've been organic from the beginning.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:09:24):**  So then did the step to biodynamic come naturally and what did the, let's say, the local environment  
**[0:09:30-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:09:30):**  or the local community thought about that?  
**[0:09:33-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:09:33):**  And then I would like to know what they think now.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:09:35):**  So I mean, organic was given.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:09:36):**  I mean, I think the family always, I mean, Gianni Lou Franco, he's the oldest of the  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:09:41):**  three brothers, always said, I mean, why in my right mind would I want to poison my land  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:09:46):**  or the food or the fields where I grow the food that I want to eat?  
**[0:09:50-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:09:50):**  So that would have never made any sense to them.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:09:53):**  And then in the nineties, that's when they started with biodynamics and that was more  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:09:57):**  of a conscious choice, you know, organic was natural and that's, they have a great grandmother,  
**[0:10:02-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:10:02):**  Nonna Catarina, and she already, I mean, in Tuscany actually people were relatively poor.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:10:08):**  So they went with what nature gave them.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:10:11):**  And so they already started using the moon cycles in terms of pruning their trees and  
**[0:10:18-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:10:18):**  so forth.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:10:19):**  And biodynamics was the choice because they realized that it gave them a certain amount  
**[0:10:25-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:10:25):**  of regenerative practices that were helpful.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:10:28):**  And also it put basically the farm kind of like a little universe where every aspect  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:10:34):**  of it, you know, the sum of each part is greater than each principle alone.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:10:39):**  And that there was no market here for biodynamic products and the fact that you were already  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:10:45):**  selling in Germany, the Netherlands and the UK and for people from outside, I think Germany  
**[0:10:49-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:10:49):**  is still one of the main markets for organic and for biodynamic in, especially in Europe  
**[0:10:54-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:10:54):**  and the market has continued to grow.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:10:55):**  So the relationship you had there immediately understood biodynamic and certification, et  
**[0:10:59-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:10:59):**  cetera.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:11:00):**  While here in Italy, that's been something of the last years, maybe that's...  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:11:04):**  Yes, especially because, well, in Italy people were much more skeptical, but then again,  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:11:09):**  I mean, there's a lot of skeptical people still that don't understand the way biodynamic  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:11:13):**  works and I think it's cool that one puts cow horns in the ground and they don't understand  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:11:19):**  that it's basically just a simple farming practice that dates back, you know, thousands  
**[0:11:23-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:11:23):**  of years.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:11:24):**  It's not something new.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:11:25):**  No, it's not something new.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:11:27):**  And in a way, though, slowly people are understanding more and more and also through the foundation,  
**[0:11:32-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:11:32):**  obviously we also tried to help our neighboring farmers to convert to first organic and then  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:11:39):**  slowly also to biodynamic agriculture by supporting them with our knowledge, sometimes  
**[0:11:44-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:11:44):**  also with a financial contribution.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:11:45):**  And are you then buying of them as in, because that also completely changes your relationship  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:11:51):**  in the region as you are having a potential sales channel and of course...  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:11:56):**  Sometimes, yes.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:11:57):**  We call them like our friends, farming friends, so to speak.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:12:01):**  And it also obviously say, okay, now we did all that, but what are we going to do with  
**[0:12:05-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:12:05):**  the products?  
**[0:12:06-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:12:06):**  So we have, for example, for some olive oils that come from farms that have been converted  
**[0:12:11-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:12:11):**  to organic farming.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:12:13):**  Now what's the perception in the region here, especially the nearby ones, because it's not,  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:12:18):**  let's say, La Vialla in Italy is not very known because all of the sales goes toward  
**[0:12:23-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:12:23):**  those over the Alps, but of course you employ more than 150 people and are an important  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:12:29):**  player here in, especially in agriculture and other.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:12:32):**  So what's the, are you still the weirdos on the fields and the hippies or has that shifted  
**[0:12:36-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:12:36):**  a bit?  
**[0:12:37-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:12:37):**  Well, it has shifted a little bit.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:12:38):**  Because you're winning a lot of prizes for wine.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:12:40):**  It's not, I mean, the quality, you must be doing something right, not just for the land,  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:12:44):**  et cetera, because you've been constantly winning prizes for wine, which is probably  
**[0:12:48-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:12:48):**  the sector where biodynamic has grown the most because it translates in many cases into  
**[0:12:52-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:12:52):**  really, really good wine.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:12:53):**  So there's something there that people start to see first, maybe compared to tomato sauce  
**[0:12:58-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:12:58):**  or other.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:12:59):**  Yeah, the perception has changed and there's actually more interest.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:13:02):**  And so we do get more requests, so also do maybe some seminars for other farmers.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:13:08):**  But it also happens at a certain point, it becomes more difficult to scale it the way  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:13:12):**  where you get so many interesting projects, you do a lot of research, but then at a certain  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:13:17):**  point you also stop having the manpower to do everything that you are requesting.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:13:22):**  You're becoming more than only your...  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:13:24):**  Yeah, I mean, it's interesting because you really only can maintain what you can sustain.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:13:28):**  And I think that goes for everything in a way.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:13:31):**  I mean, just the way our food culture is globally right now, we are literally not being able  
**[0:13:37-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:13:37):**  to maintain the lifestyle that we have.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:13:40):**  And I think it's interesting and hopefully there's always more awareness and a shift  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:13:45):**  in consciousness that people really, in terms of their consumer choices, do understand that  
**[0:13:50-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:13:50):**  agriculture in terms of regenerative agriculture is really one of the most impactful positive  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:13:58):**  change that one can make in terms of the climate change.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:14:02):**  Shifting gears a bit to the consumer obviously is buying from you.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:14:08):**  What do you see or have you recommend?  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:14:09):**  You mentioned the foundation, but in other ways, what's the role beyond our role as a  
**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:14:13):**  consumer, but also our role as an investor, which could be big or small.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:14:17):**  What do you see as the role of money in, say, the next 40 years of La Viala, but also by  
**[0:14:22-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:14:22):**  dynamic agriculture or the region of Tuscany and agriculture?  
**[0:14:25-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:14:25):**  Are we in that phase of speeding up?  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:14:27):**  And is there a role of finance as you have been very successful, but it hasn't always  
**[0:14:31-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:14:31):**  been easy?  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:14:32):**  It's not that money is grown on trees here for 40 years.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:14:34):**  Do you see a role for another role for investors instead of just buy our stuff or other stuff  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:14:40):**  from by dynamic farms and hope that it will be enough?  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:14:42):**  Because that's what I used to say.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:14:44):**  If we just all buy some slightly better food, then we'll be okay.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:14:48):**  I come to see us.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:14:49):**  That would definitely be the first step.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:14:50):**  And then the second step, I think, is that yes, of course, it would be helpful if people  
**[0:14:54-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:14:54):**  would understand that there are projects that one can invest in that actually, in a way,  
**[0:15:00-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:15:00):**  speed up the process of regenerating landscapes and regenerating food production and really  
**[0:15:07-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:15:07):**  looking at soil.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:15:08):**  I mean, soil is such an important part.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:15:11):**  People always ask me or a lot of times ask me, Oh, why are you is your pasta so good?  
**[0:15:15-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:15:15):**  Well, it's simple.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:15:16):**  It's the soil that our grains are grown on.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:15:20):**  I mean, if the soil isn't very good, you will never get food that is delicious, nutritional  
**[0:15:26-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:15:26):**  dense.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:15:27):**  It's kind of like you reap what you sow.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:15:30):**  So the biodiversity and the fertility of the soil is one of our main focuses actually at  
**[0:15:37-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:15:37):**  La Viala.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:15:38):**  And do you have those discussions within the company as well?  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:15:42):**  Like, okay, how can we scale up faster or scale up or scale the impact?  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:15:47):**  I'm not saying we should endlessly grow La Viala and occupy all of Italy, but shifting  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:15:52):**  from that mindset of or do you get those discussions or is it still very much focused?  
**[0:15:57-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:15:57):**  Okay, we make an amazing product.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:15:59):**  We keep growing organically in terms of we get other lands, maybe leased, maybe bought,  
**[0:16:04-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:16:04):**  or is there starting to become okay, there is an opportunity to the next 10, 15 years  
**[0:16:08-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:16:08):**  to really, because we need to, because we have 10, 15 years left.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:16:11):**  We're in another huge drought.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:16:12):**  We're in floodings in Germany, the Netherlands and the UK or in Belgium.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:16:16):**  So we are...  
**[0:16:17-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:16:17):**  Yeah, we tend to lean more towards an organic growth because it becomes so difficult to  
**[0:16:24-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:16:24):**  say, oh, let's get another piece of land.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:16:27):**  But yes, in a way, yes, of course, we're always interested in being able to invest in another  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:16:33):**  piece of land, invest in the naturalization of something that is completely degraded.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:16:39):**  And in Tuscany there is a lot of land degraded, right?  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:16:41):**  Well, not a lot of land, but there is a lot of abandoned land still.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:16:45):**  And now I think slowly there's another shift that people are going, well, it's kind of  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:16:52):**  weird because there's a movement from younger people that are going back to the land, but  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:16:56):**  there's also an older generation that is saying, okay, we're done.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:17:00):**  We don't want to do this anymore.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:17:02):**  And so, yeah, for us it's always interesting to have opportunities.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:17:06):**  And it's not so much focused only on Tuscany because one thing that we started doing or  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:17:11):**  that actually the founders, Piero and Giuliana, did quite early on is to also diversify.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:17:16):**  I mean, we have some vineyards in Sicily.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:17:19):**  We have vineyards in the Maremma, which is still Tuscany, but still not here around Arezzo.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:17:25):**  We also have vineyards in the Marche.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:17:28):**  And the idea is really we have olive groves in Puglia.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:17:32):**  And the idea is really to see that we can also, you know, let's say there is a natural  
**[0:17:37-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:17:37):**  catastrophe for a farmer and that's really horrible to not lose something immediately  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:17:43):**  and lose a whole harvest, but to be able to say, okay, but we still have...  
**[0:17:48-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:17:48):**  The diversifying in terms of, yeah, one hailstorm can do a lot of damage, but not if you're  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:17:52):**  in Maremma, which is quite a long road from here and Puglia is even further.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:17:56):**  And so that's something that we are really interested in.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:17:58):**  And what we have found though is really, and I don't know, I think you can feel it when  
**[0:18:03-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:18:03):**  you're especially here in Paturia La Vialla.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:18:05):**  I mean, after so many years, it just has a certain energy and a feel to it.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:18:10):**  And what we've noticed, I mean, obviously not for the crops like grains or the tomatoes.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:18:15):**  Well, the tomatoes actually do, I mean, they taste so much better and actually they have  
**[0:18:20-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:18:20):**  a higher brick and sugar and are more nutritionally dense.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:18:23):**  We do measure that.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:18:25):**  But for example, that our olive trees, olive groves and vineyards are so much more resilient.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:18:31):**  And I think that is what is important.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:18:32):**  We've noticed that there's been more droughts, but our plants are actually able to deal better  
**[0:18:38-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:18:38):**  with it.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:18:39):**  Let's talk about measurement because you brought it up.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:18:41):**  What do you measure?  
**[0:18:42-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:18:42):**  Because you measure quite a bit.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:18:43):**  Yeah, we measure the soil fertility.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:18:45):**  We do that yearly.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:18:46):**  I mean, of all the different plots in order to really see whether...  
**[0:18:53-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:18:53):**  What you measure is the biomass in the soil.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:18:56):**  And what we've noticed that even though we are farming the land, it actually increases.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:19:02):**  Which already is not such an easy feat to pull off.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:19:05):**  Then of course we do, we measure the nutrients in our food.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:19:11):**  We actually, every batch we produce, we also do a complete chemical analysis in order to  
**[0:19:17-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:19:17):**  ensure that nothing is in there, is contaminated since there's always, it's a big discussion  
**[0:19:23-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:19:23):**  how you might be farming biodynamically, but actually things like glyphosate, they're actually  
**[0:19:30-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:19:30):**  spreading.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:19:31):**  I mean, they're not just going into the water, but they also connect to the sand particles  
**[0:19:35-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:19:35):**  and travel like thousands of miles.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:19:37):**  So to ensure that whatever we produce and sell to the end consumer is actually completely  
**[0:19:44-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:19:44):**  free of any kind of chemical residues.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:19:47):**  And you do that as well with some stuff you can buy in the supermarket, like the colleagues,  
**[0:19:53-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:19:53):**  let's say, or the competitors.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:19:54):**  Well, it's just we're curious.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:19:55):**  Curiousity, yeah.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:19:56):**  We do sometimes also test other producers not to be, just to see where they're at.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:20:02):**  And we found that a lot of times some of the organically produced wines or foodstuffs actually  
**[0:20:09-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:20:09):**  are contaminated.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:20:10):**  Which is very scary if you think about it.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:20:13):**  And in terms of you measure soil health as well, you've been carbon negative or positive  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:20:18):**  like on the right side of the scale for a long time.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:20:20):**  Yeah, we've been actually measuring our carbon footprint since 2008.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:20:24):**  Which is very early.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:20:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:20:26):**  And then also slowly adapting because obviously the farm itself, the land itself, I mean,  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:20:30):**  we're carbon positive because we're able through biodynamic agriculture sequester the carbon  
**[0:20:35-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:20:35):**  into the soil.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:20:36):**  However, obviously we do have the whole transportation.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:20:40):**  Packaging.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:20:41):**  Packaging, even though it's glass, but glass is actually quite a high impact in terms of  
**[0:20:46-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:20:46):**  CO2 emissions.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:20:48):**  But so we do the balancing.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:20:50):**  We're able to, some of those aspects we have to compensate.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:20:56):**  But so starting last year, we're actually climate positive.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:21:00):**  Yeah, and you had a, I remember visiting here quite a few years ago and you had a massive  
**[0:21:06-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:21:06):**  solar panel.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:21:07):**  Yes.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:21:08):**  And you had already up then, which for many years has been producing more than enough  
**[0:21:12-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:21:12):**  electricity to cover a lot here.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:21:15):**  So what would you say, because you have an amazing restaurant here or you have an amazing  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:21:19):**  place where people come and eat and for sure people come here on a holiday mindset with  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:21:23):**  their holiday hat on, but they might work in banks or insurance companies or they might  
**[0:21:27-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:21:27):**  invest in their own money or their foundation money.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:21:29):**  What would you, if they ask, because they don't want to be bothered in their holidays,  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:21:32):**  a different atmosphere, what would you tell them if they ask, okay, what should I do?  
**[0:21:37-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:21:37):**  I understand the soil is extremely important.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:21:39):**  I visited the farm, I ate the quality and I feel and I see the nutrients are different,  
**[0:21:44-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:21:44):**  but now I want to become active.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:21:45):**  What would your, obviously without giving investment advice, but what would your advice  
**[0:21:50-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:21:50):**  be of next steps?  
**[0:21:51-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:21:51):**  Should you become a farmer yourself?  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:21:53):**  Should you buy something?  
**[0:21:54-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:21:54):**  Where should they put their money to work?  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:21:56):**  I think there's already, there's quite a bit of funds that actually invest in regenerative  
**[0:22:01-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:22:01):**  agriculture.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:22:02):**  And I think something like that can be good.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:22:04):**  But of course I think investing like this, but also of course your consumer choices.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:22:08):**  I mean, I think that's the most important thing because so many times people say, yeah,  
**[0:22:13-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:22:13):**  but it's so expensive.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:22:15):**  But I think there's a whole aspect of two cost accounting, which still isn't considered  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:22:20):**  very much that, you know, a regenerative agriculture or in our case, biodynamic agriculture, we  
**[0:22:26-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:22:26):**  do not only create goods that have a certain value, but we also by sequestering carbon  
**[0:22:33-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:22:33):**  into the soil, we also create a commodity that is a benefit to society and that is never  
**[0:22:40-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:22:40):**  measured or taken into account when you do an overall price range.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:22:46):**  Are you looking into or already being compensated for these ecosystem services so far?  
**[0:22:52-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:22:52):**  Because there hasn't been a market for it.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:22:54):**  Like the biodiversity, water and carbon are the first, but there are many others that  
**[0:22:59-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:22:59):**  were early there, but there's a lot happening, which could, at least in the transition phase  
**[0:23:03-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:23:03):**  of whatever the transition is, help with that gap in price of the very, very cheap.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:23:07):**  Right now what we need is more like a shift in consciousness and really people understanding  
**[0:23:13-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:23:13):**  much more the overall connectedness of how, you know, I mean, what the way we consume,  
**[0:23:20-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:23:20):**  what foods we consume, the way we live, and especially in agriculture, it can have such  
**[0:23:25-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:23:25):**  a big impact.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:23:26):**  You know, if you think about it, one third of all climate emissions, CO emissions actually  
**[0:23:33-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:23:33):**  come from conventional agriculture.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:23:35):**  I mean, one third, that's a high number.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:23:37):**  And if we could manage to shift that and really shift to regenerative agriculture, I mean,  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:23:44):**  that would already be so helpful and make a big impact in terms of the current climate  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:23:49):**  crisis.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:23:50):**  So would it be helpful or do you see a lot of opportunity to, say, educate between brackets,  
**[0:23:56-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:23:56):**  but the consumer on the bigger picture, the whole picture of buying certain types of food  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:24:02):**  compared to others?  
**[0:24:04-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:24:04):**  You have a role there, obviously, and you play that very well.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:24:07):**  You communicate a lot on certain things, on quality, on taste, on carbon, etc.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:24:12):**  Would it be helpful if many others, would there be more regenerative, let's say, regenerative  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:24:16):**  food brands that can actually bring the story from the soil to the table and hopefully get  
**[0:24:21-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:24:21):**  more consumers into it?  
**[0:24:22-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:24:22):**  Or do you see there's enough demand that we need more supply of those products?  
**[0:24:25-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:24:25):**  Oh, I think we first need to educate.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:24:28):**  It's not our way to raise the finger and say, oh, we shouldn't be doing this, but kind of  
**[0:24:35-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:24:35):**  leading by example.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:24:36):**  And so many times when people come here, and sometimes the people that are staying with  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:24:41):**  us, we have like an olive harvest.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:24:46):**  We give people the opportunity to help us harvest for a couple of hours, and only a  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:24:50):**  couple of hours already people understand that a bottle of olive oil cannot cost three  
**[0:24:55-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:24:55):**  euros if it's extra virgin, or in general, and that something has to be wrong with it.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:25:03):**  And just understand also the value of the land and how much effort and how much risk  
**[0:25:08-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:25:08):**  and how much sweat it actually takes to produce a liter of olive oil or to produce a kilo  
**[0:25:16-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:25:16):**  of tomatoes.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:25:17):**  And I think people have gone, in a way, we have the ability to have such a banquet in  
**[0:25:23-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:25:23):**  terms of food, but we've really lost the ability to relate to it, how it's grown and what it  
**[0:25:30-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:25:30):**  takes.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:25:31):**  And I think that is an important piece.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:25:33):**  And like have a little vegetable patch, you can even put it on your balcony, just to go  
**[0:25:38-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:25:38):**  back to really having an experience of seeing something grow and understanding how much  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:25:45):**  it takes actually to bring it to fruition.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:25:48):**  Yeah, I think it's something we come back to very often, also for investors that read  
**[0:25:53-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:25:53):**  the books and looked at the watch the documentaries, etc.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:25:56):**  But go and visit a few farms, spend time help if that's possible.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:26:00):**  In many cases, it's probably not very helpful because you do more damage.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:26:04):**  Yeah, we get a lot of requests for people to say we would love to come and work for  
**[0:26:07-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:26:07):**  two weeks with you guys.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:26:09):**  And that for us, it's been as much as we would love to do it.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:26:13):**  It's just not helpful, you know, because you have to train them and then you have to follow  
**[0:26:18-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:26:18):**  them kind of and work behind them.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:26:21):**  But I think if I had a lot of money, I think that would be something that I would add to  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:26:24):**  a farm to have that one aspect where people can really have that experience.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:26:29):**  Without doing too much damage.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:26:30):**  Yeah, well, you're still making high quality wines.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:26:33):**  It's very important to pick the right grapes.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:26:34):**  And it actually leads naturally to another question we always like to ask.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:26:39):**  So what if tomorrow morning, Annette, or this evening, even you're in charge of a large  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:26:43):**  investment fund, you have to invest it, but it could be evergreen, it could be extremely  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:26:48):**  long term, let's say a billion dollars or billion euros in Europe here.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:26:52):**  What would be your priorities?  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:26:53):**  Well, how would you not to the exact year, obviously, but what would be the main sectors?  
**[0:26:58-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:26:58):**  A large portion, I would definitely invest into abandoned land and farming and the general  
**[0:27:04-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:27:04):**  farming, but also set up a distribution in a way.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:27:08):**  I would diversify also, I would probably also invest in other countries.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:27:14):**  That part of it also be educational, and then definitely also some like some startup in  
**[0:27:21-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:27:21):**  terms of technology.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:27:22):**  I think there's right now there's such an amazing amount of possibility in terms of  
**[0:27:28-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:27:28):**  startup companies, blockchain technology and things like that with sensors where we're  
**[0:27:34-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:27:34):**  really in terms of farming, it could be a really good intersection.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:27:39):**  I don't think you can farm only by satellites or something like that, because I think it's  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:27:45):**  really important to have like the hands on and the feel for the soil that you're working  
**[0:27:51-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:27:51):**  for the place where you're at.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:27:52):**  But I think there's some really great tools that are being developed.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:27:56):**  And definitely also some money into renewable energies, because I think there's still a  
**[0:28:03-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:28:03):**  lot to be done.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:28:04):**  And in terms of technologies, something maybe you haven't seen yet being developed, what  
**[0:28:08-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:28:08):**  would be the highest on your list?  
**[0:28:10-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:28:10):**  Like what would you wish to be there tomorrow that would be very helpful for La Viala?  
**[0:28:18-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:28:18):**  Is it the nutrient density meter?  
**[0:28:19-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:28:19):**  Or is it a soil health meter?  
**[0:28:21-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:28:21):**  Or is it an electric tractor?  
**[0:28:24-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:28:24):**  Electric tractor would be great.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:28:25):**  We're actually waiting on that one.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:28:27):**  And some really being able to measure the nutritional density, the amount of nutrients,  
**[0:28:34-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:28:34):**  in terms of watersheds.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:28:37):**  Technologies like these that actually help us.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:28:40):**  I mean, we already invested a lot.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:28:41):**  We now have really weather stations in all of the vineyards, because we found the weather  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:28:46):**  is so unpredictable that it's really helpful to be able to read all the data, even though  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:28:51):**  maybe they're just 500 meters apart.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:28:56):**  It can go so quick that especially when we're right before harvest, if you see there's a  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:29:00):**  big thunderstorm with possible hail, that you can actually go into the vineyard and  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:29:05):**  harvest it and say, okay, at least this one we saved.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:29:09):**  So it's a lot of that observing which would help us make better decisions.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:29:14):**  Because of course, if you manage a hectare, you can observe everything relatively easily,  
**[0:29:18-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:29:18):**  even though a hectare is still quite large.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:29:19):**  But if you're managing 1,600, it becomes a whole different...  
**[0:29:24-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:29:24):**  There are too many variables to start, but it never takes away from the actual observing  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:29:28):**  of the land and the feeling and touching because sensors go wrong very often.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:29:32):**  But to be able to observe that.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:29:34):**  And then a contrary question we always like to ask, definitely inspired by John Kemp.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:29:39):**  Where do you think differently in this sector when you talk to other biodynamic farmers  
**[0:29:43-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:29:43):**  or when you go to conferences and events?  
**[0:29:45-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:29:45):**  And where do you see that you're actually quite contrarian?  
**[0:29:49-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:29:49):**  Well, I can't say that I'm quite contrarian.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:29:51):**  What I find actually is there's so much information and there's so much new projects in terms  
**[0:29:58-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:29:58):**  of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:30:00):**  There's so many funds that are looking for projects.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:30:04):**  And then a lot of times these streams don't go together because especially the pioneers  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:30:08):**  and for me, Fatoria La Viala is definitely a pioneering farm.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:30:13):**  It's hard to bring people together at the table because sometimes I feel like, okay,  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:30:17):**  I mean, there's so much information, there's so many incredible projects, but we still  
**[0:30:22-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:30:22):**  haven't reached that critical mass.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:30:24):**  If only we managed to bring it all together and be more cooperative and not so much because  
**[0:30:31-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:30:31):**  people don't want to be cooperative, but because farming in itself takes away so much time  
**[0:30:35-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:30:35):**  that it, as I mentioned before, there's so many projects we would love to do, but there's  
**[0:30:41-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:30:41):**  only 24 hours in a day.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:30:43):**  At a certain point you have to simply say, okay, let's focus on this one and focus on  
**[0:30:46-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:30:46):**  that one.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:30:48):**  So yes, to bring it all together, to have an easier way to connecting and working together.  
**[0:30:53-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:30:53):**  And do you see or do you think that the pioneers in the space, the original organic players  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:31:02):**  and biodynamic players that in many cases have been there for 30, 40 years, do they  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:31:07):**  get enough attention in the regenerative movement and hype that we're going up now?  
**[0:31:11-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:31:11):**  Actually, yeah, it's a funny, yeah.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:31:13):**  I was thinking about that earlier, actually.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:31:15):**  That, yeah, I mean, biodynamic farmers right now, because they don't call themselves in  
**[0:31:20-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:31:20):**  terms of doing regenerative agriculture, it almost seems that they don't play a role.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:31:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:31:26):**  And I think that's kind of strange actually, because it is absolutely regenerative agriculture  
**[0:31:31-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:31:31):**  and they kind of laid the groundwork.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:31:33):**  So yeah, it would be good to integrate it more and also have an exchange of ideas and  
**[0:31:38-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:31:38):**  more collaboration.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:31:39):**  And what could the biodynamic movement learn from the regenerative movement?  
**[0:31:44-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:31:44):**  I mean, they're in the same movement.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:31:46):**  You see, is it the communication or what is next for biodynamic?  
**[0:31:50-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:31:50):**  What do you see?  
**[0:31:51-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:31:51):**  Well, I can't speak for the biodynamic association, but for me, yeah, no, I mean, in terms of  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:31:57):**  the biodynamic association, sometimes I think they do not communicate.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:32:01):**  I mean, it's still, there's a certain amount of wording that maybe could be different and  
**[0:32:07-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:32:07):**  still say the same thing and maybe make it more accessible to a broader audience.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:32:13):**  But I also understand, I mean, if you've been working in this niche for so long, I think  
**[0:32:18-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:32:18):**  it also becomes a little bit more difficult to kind of branch out.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:32:22):**  And in a way, Patria La Viola has shown that you can do that.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:32:25):**  I mean, the way we do the communication and for that also, it's incredibly valuable to  
**[0:32:29-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:32:29):**  have this value chain of being able to communicate directly with the end consumer and not have  
**[0:32:36-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:32:36):**  like a distributor in between us.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:32:39):**  Because we always know when something is great, people will let us know.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:32:44):**  But when we do something where they don't agree with, they will let us know as well.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:32:48):**  And it's such an amazing, I mean, we really look at our clients as friends.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:32:51):**  It's more an interchange of ideas and appreciation in a way.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:32:57):**  I think that's just to underline you are selling everything directly.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:33:02):**  There's no distributor, no restaurants, nothing.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:33:05):**  Everything goes straight to the end consumer at a scale that I don't think there's anything  
**[0:33:09-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:33:09):**  else or at least I don't have anything else that is so pure and at that scale too and  
**[0:33:15-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:33:15):**  in the biodynamic world.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:33:17):**  And what is next for La Viola in terms of agriculture?  
**[0:33:20-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:33:20):**  What are you excited about?  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:33:21):**  Are you experimenting apart from the year waiting for an electric tractor?  
**[0:33:25-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:33:25):**  But apart from that?  
**[0:33:26-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:33:26):**  Yeah, we're also waiting on some sensors.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:33:29):**  And just in a way, just continuing with what we're doing and really being able to continue  
**[0:33:35-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:33:35):**  to do what we love to do.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:33:36):**  Do you do a lot of experiments in terms of agriculture practice?  
**[0:33:39-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:33:39):**  Yes, we do.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:33:40):**  We actually, I mean, in terms of the vineyards, we did a project where we actually took all  
**[0:33:45-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:33:45):**  the different autochthon varieties out of the different vineyards and we put them, we  
**[0:33:50-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:33:50):**  cloned them in another vineyard and then actually vinified each one to kind of see in what way  
**[0:33:56-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:33:56):**  we could integrate them into the winemaking.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:33:59):**  Then obviously we have the whole, with our olive fruit water, there's a lot of research  
**[0:34:04-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:34:04):**  being done there because it has 20 times more polyphenols than the actual olive oil.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:34:11):**  And furthermore, I thought there's so many things we were doing.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:34:16):**  We are obviously always interested in, you know, in biodynamic agriculture, you're allowed  
**[0:34:21-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:34:21):**  to use certain, for example, sulfite in the vineyards and obviously in a much, much, much  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:34:27):**  lower concentration than in organic or conventional agriculture.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:34:32):**  But we are trying to reduce that even more.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:34:34):**  So we've done some trials, again, with the olive fruit water that are very promising.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:34:41):**  But it's kind of hard.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:34:42):**  I mean, we've been doing it for the past seven years and slowly also expanding the experimental  
**[0:34:47-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:34:47):**  vineyard.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:34:48):**  But because each year is slightly different in terms of the conditions, it's not so easy  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:34:54):**  to say, oh, this is the thing that's going to be the answer to it all.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:34:59):**  So yeah.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:35:00):**  Like all agriculture research, the variables are so large that it's extremely difficult  
**[0:35:05-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:35:05):**  to do.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:35:06):**  And as a final question, if you could change one thing in agriculture and food, the whole  
**[0:35:10-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:35:10):**  food system, if you want to, you have a magic wand, you have the power to change one thing  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:35:14):**  and then ask for more like Aladdin, as some people did.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:35:18):**  What would that be?  
**[0:35:19-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:35:19):**  What would that one thing be?  
**[0:35:20-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:35:20):**  Then all pesticides and synthetic chemicals overnight, overnight gone.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:35:25):**  And I think, well, maybe that's a little harsh because I think I would cause havoc.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:35:30):**  But yeah, I mean, to convert really to regenerative agriculture in whatever shape and form.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:35:35):**  Maybe by dynamic agriculture, maybe permaculture, maybe integrational, but yes, absolutely.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:35:42):**  I think the world and the earth would benefit so much from that.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:35:47):**  I think then there's a need for a lot of transition, which is very interesting because it will  
**[0:35:51-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:35:51):**  be a massive.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:35:52):**  But the thing is, I mean, if we don't start now, if we continue to push it into the future,  
**[0:35:56-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:35:56):**  I mean, I don't know.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:35:57):**  I mean, I sometimes wonder, I mean, you know, I have children and I don't want my children  
**[0:36:01-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:36:01):**  and children's children to live in a world where there is only desert around them.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:36:05):**  And also in terms of the climate change, I mean, we're so close to not being able to  
**[0:36:11-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:36:11):**  even two degrees of rise in temperature are becoming more and more unlikely if we continue  
**[0:36:20-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:36:20):**  to pass there on right now and we don't take some really drastic measures.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:36:25):**  And so I think, you know, all time is now.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:36:29):**  Getting diesel cars, burning all chemical inputs and get through the transition as soon  
**[0:36:34-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:36:34):**  as possible.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:36:35):**  It will be rough, but maybe it's a necessary thing because the cost after will be only  
**[0:36:38-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:36:38):**  bigger.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:36:39):**  Like every day we wait, the bill just goes.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:36:40):**  I mean, if you think about it, I mean, all the changes that are happening currently in  
**[0:36:45-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:36:45):**  terms of the climate, I mean, that was predicted 20 years ago and nothing or very, very little  
**[0:36:51-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:36:51):**  changed next to nothing changed.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:36:54):**  And so if we're going to wait another 20 years, I don't think we have a planet that you will  
**[0:36:58-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:36:58):**  really want to live on.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:37:01):**  It's the next 10, 15 years.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:37:03):**  That are so decisive.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:37:04):**  I want to thank you so much for this interview.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:37:07):**  I definitely will be checking in.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:37:09):**  I think it's a very interesting moment in La Viala's history and the next 10, 15 years  
**[0:37:14-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:37:14):**  will be also here.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:37:15):**  It decides if Tuscany will recuperate a lot of the greater land and the rest of Italy  
**[0:37:19-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:37:19):**  as well because climate change is hitting hard or not and we'll be at the driver's  
**[0:37:24-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:37:24):**  seat of that.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:37:25):**  I'd love to.

**[0:38:10-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:38:10):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[0:38:15-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:38:15):**  Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:38:18):**  How to put money to work in regenerating soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while  
**[0:38:22-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:38:22):**  doing it.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:38:23):**  So why are we doing this course?  
**[0:38:25-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:38:25):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:38:29-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:38:29):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following this space since 2011 and recording  
**[0:38:34-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:38:34):**  this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:38:39):**  What have we seen in this space over the last years?  
**[0:38:41-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:38:41):**  How have we built our decision making framework?

**[0:39:16-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:39:16):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:39:19):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office or as private  
**[0:39:23-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:39:23):**  individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through foundations,

**[0:39:32-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:39:32):**  No.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:39:33):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:39:36):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:39:41):**  that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with very different means.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:39:45):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:39:50-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:39:50):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:39:53):**  Thank you.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:39:54):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:39:55-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:39:55):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes, plus PDF slides  
**[0:40:02-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:40:02):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:40:04):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:40:09-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:40:09):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:40:14-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:40:14):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:40:19-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:40:19):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:40:20):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:40:25-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:40:25):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:40:29):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:40:34):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:40:35-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:40:35):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:40:37):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:40:39):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:40:43):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:40:45):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/annette-muller#t=0:40:50):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:00:16):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  the planet mattered.  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:00:26):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:00:38):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:00:49):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:01:02):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further, share more interviews, there  are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:01:15):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  support me and make this happen.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:01:26):**  For more information please find the link to my Patreon account in the description below.  And now, without further ado, the interview.  Enjoy!  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:01:36):**  Welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, agriculture as if the planet mattered.  In these interviews I am talking to people who are scaling up the sector, either by increasing  the influx of capital or by working underground to scale up the enterprises underground.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:01:51):**  Why regenerative agriculture?  Because so many of the world current issues come together in this subject.  From drought to water scarcity, climate change, social issues, hunger, obesity all have a  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:01):**  connection to how we grow food and what we eat.  You're gonna listen to an interview with Mike Korczynski, founder and CEO of Wildlife  Works.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:09):**  We're gonna discuss many things in this interview, from why agriculture is taking a more central  stage in the whole CO2 discussion, what Paris and the Paris Agreement did to his company,  and the holy grail of forest and landscape protection.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:24):**  Is that coming through to you?  I have...  Yeah.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:27):**  I can hear the dog, but that's...  If it does, I mean, that's Wildlife Works.  I mean, there's of course gonna be noise of animals in the background.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:38):**  It should stop.  As you said, we're Wildlife Works.  They will be quiet eventually.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:42):**  Don't worry about it.  I will start.  So welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, agriculture as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:49):**  I'm Koen Van Zeyen, the host of today.  And in the podcast today, I'm talking to Mike Korczynski, founder of Wildlife Works, one  of the world's leading REDD plus organizations using voluntary CO2 credits for ecosystem  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:03:00):**  restoration with local stakeholders.  Welcome Mike.  Thank you.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:03:05):**  Thank you very much, Koen.  And to dive into immediately a personal question, why are you doing what you're doing?  The honest answer is elephants, I think.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:03:16):**  I started my love of elephants when I was, I don't know, four years old or something  and lived in a place that didn't have any, but collected lots of little elephant statues  and figurines everywhere I went with my allowance when I was a kid.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:03:30):**  And then when I was not a kid anymore and had a little bit of time and a little bit  of money, I had promised myself I would go see elephants.  And so I did 20 years ago, a little over 20 years ago now, went to Africa for the first  
**[0:03:48-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:03:48):**  time and was taken aback by how astonishing elephants were.  I used to say that my first reaction was jaw dropping splendor.  And then very quickly, because I have an analytical background, I couldn't help but see the challenges  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:04:13):**  that they were facing.  And so I, and the principal challenge 20 years ago, interestingly, was not ivory poaching.  That is today's challenge for sure for elephants.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:04:26):**  But 20 years ago was a, there was a lull in poaching, but the challenge that I saw was  a conflict with local communities in Africa that were growing again for the first time  in many centuries, if not millennia, because of better health care and to some degree because  
**[0:04:50-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:04:50):**  of access to aid and food aid, which made the carrying capacity of the land somewhat  irrelevant.  So I could see that these growing communities were now pushing into wilderness again, probably  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:05:09):**  again for the first time in hundreds of years in some cases, and were coming into conflict  with the wildlife and in particular with elephants, and that it struck me that in that conflict,  which there could only be one winner, humans are very creative and aggressive as a species  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:05:30):**  when our survival is at stake.  So it seemed obvious to me that a solution needed to be found where the wildlife would  be seen as an asset to the community, not just a global asset of great value, but a  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:05:48):**  local asset, and that if we couldn't find a way to make wildlife work for local communities,  then slowly but surely the wildlife would be displaced, as it essentially has in most  of the developed world.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:06:02):**  So I started Wildlife Works with the idea that you need to find a way to bring economic  value to the communities from wildlife.  So elephants all stemmed from the love of elephants and trying to find a way, but of  
**[0:06:22-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:06:22):**  course once I got into that puzzle in more detail, it became obvious that the communities  had great need and that these beautiful villages and cultures across Africa and now of course  globally are under threat equally, and that our work really revolves now mostly in these  
**[0:06:49-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:06:49):**  wilderness areas around helping communities to find a wildlife-friendly and forest-friendly  development path.  And if you would describe, I'm really struck by your story, I still remember the first  
**[0:07:05-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:07:05):**  time I saw an elephant in the wild, which is I think pretty much a life-changing experience.  And if you look at Wildlife Works as a company and as an idea, and maybe the initial days  and the current days and the future, like if you look at it in three parts, what has  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:07:25):**  changed and what will change in the future, which is a very big question, I do realize  that, but hopefully you have a few big thoughts that you started with and maybe you're doing  now differently and you hopefully will do differently in the future, or your hope at  
**[0:07:40-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:07:40):**  least.  Right, very much so.  Things have changed significantly over the years for us.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:07:48):**  So at the beginning we were a business because I came from the business world and had had  a couple of business efforts prior to starting Wildlife Works.  So and I also felt that the conservation, charitable conservation community or the NGO  
**[0:08:08-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:08:08):**  community was doing the best it could with really quite limited funding relative to the  size of the global marketplace, the size of funding for international wildlife conservation  is tiny, it's microscopic.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:08:24):**  And so it dawned on me that if the solution that I was going to work on was just to compete  with those people for money and ideas, it would be a very bad idea for me.  So the structure of Wildlife Works from the beginning has been structured as a business  
**[0:08:38-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:08:38):**  with the idea that we need to bring new sources, we need to do two things which I felt a business  was capable of doing.  One, we need to engage the marketplace directly because as long as the multi-trillion dollar  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:08:52):**  global marketplace is trashing the planet, then the small amounts as well intentioned  as they are of charitable money and sovereign money for aid will not be able to repair the  damage there's no question in my mind.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:09:06):**  So part of our mission was to engage the global marketplace and redirect their energy towards  being part of the solution wherever possible, first do no harm and then be actually positive  in being part of a solution for wildlife conservation and forest conservation.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:09:25):**  So that was one aspect of what we chose to do.  The other piece of it was really just a different funding stream that I didn't want to be out  there competing with these noble organizations that have been around for many years for a  
**[0:09:41-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:09:41):**  source of funding.  So we wanted to self-fund through business activities where we could provide value to  an organization or a consumer and get paid in return and use that money as a new source  
**[0:09:56-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:09:56):**  of conservation finance.  So those were the two aspects that dictated the model that we have.  So we are a for-profit model, very small company still with a big reach as we like to say.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:10:14):**  In the beginning how that model was implemented, in the beginning which is 1997, the Kyoto  Protocol did not exist.  So the greenhouse gas protocols that are now part of everyday conversation were not part  
**[0:10:30-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:10:30):**  of everyday conversation.  Kyoto had not happened.  So at the beginning of the company we tried to find a way to tie the production of goods  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:10:41):**  in a rural community to the global marketplace.  We thought gee, just imagine if every product that, I don't know, Banana Republic let's  say because they have a name that implies that they might be located in a developing  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:10:56):**  country, let's just say that every product they made was sourced in a fair trade sustainable  way from a rural community that lived with wildlife.  Can you imagine the impact of all that funding going into these communities and if you could  
**[0:11:12-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:11:12):**  do it in a way where the success of the brand was dependent on protection of wildlife and  forests so that the consumer's buying and the growth of the company was dependent on  maintaining and improving the quality of the environment for wildlife and forest then you  
**[0:11:32-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:11:32):**  really have something significant and you'd set a conservation on a new course with a  new set of funding and a new relationship really with rural communities which is something  that's also was important to me that rural communities needed to be part of the solution  
**[0:11:49-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:11:49):**  and needed to feel that the solution was inclusive of them.  So when we started the company, it's a long way around of saying when we started we made  t-shirts believe it or not.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:11:58):**  We wanted to produce something in rural Kenya in an elephant sanctuary.  We wanted to produce something that was not going to consume local resources in a fragile  ecosystem so we decided not to do anything agricultural in that community.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:12:15):**  That community has some very unique characteristics related to agriculture.  It's very, very dry.  That's the main one.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:12:22):**  So we chose there to make products and brand them under the Wildlife Works brand and then  sell those products to the international community and the jobs in what we call our eco-factory  which is a relatively tiny by international standards rammed earth sowing facility in  
**[0:12:40-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:12:40):**  the bush.  Those jobs gave the women in the community some source of income to put their kids through  school and we tied that back to the conservation of wildlife so the compact with the community  
**[0:12:53-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:12:53):**  was look we can't compete with the real Banana Republic or the Gap on marketing because they  spend vast sums of money convincing people to buy their goods.  So we're going to need passionate loyal consumers to buy our goods because we're using their  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:13:11):**  money to protect wildlife and so that from the beginning was the model that we set up  and that model ran for about 10 years.  It's still going today.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:13:19):**  I will add that that factory is still alive and well and running but mostly we make product  for other groups now because the idea of a fair trade factory in the middle of an elephant  sanctuary became quite interesting to a number of other companies that were trying to improve  
**[0:13:38-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:13:38):**  their environmental performance.  So we do make product for other brands now and that it continues to be an important activity  of our project as far as job creation and in particular for women.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:13:51):**  Women's job creation is concerned.  But about 10 years ago of course Kyoto happened in 1998.  Conversations about greenhouse gases and climate change started before that but really in earnest  
**[0:14:07-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:14:07):**  at that time and then protocols were established for how we might mitigate the impacts of climate  and among those conversations were conversations about forests and for reasons that are sad  historical reasons forests were excluded, the protected forests were excluded from the  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:14:26):**  Kyoto Protocol but conversations continued amongst conservationists about the value of  forests in the climate fight and in roughly 2005 forests reentered the dialogue and this  idea of REDD+, reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation came into discussion  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:14:51):**  within the UN and within the surrounding activities.  And so we looked at that very closely and realized that the emerging REDD+, mechanism  was really a very ideal financing mechanism for the work we were doing and for the work  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:15:13):**  of conservation in many cases because for a number of reasons but essentially it's a  payment for ecosystem services or at least that was the promise and we'll come back to  how long it's taken to fulfill on that promise but the idea of forests providing great value  
**[0:15:31-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:15:31):**  in climate mitigation and the more important idea, more urgent idea that destroying forests  accelerates climate change because it releases vast amounts of carbon stored in the trees  into the atmosphere so instead of being an assistant in helping us mitigate the impacts  
**[0:15:52-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:15:52):**  of our human activity on the planet by absorbing carbon which is what trees do to grow, destroying  them reverses that process and puts the carbon back in the atmosphere.  So REDD+, recognized that and we decided to get behind that so in 2009 we launched a new  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:16:11):**  company, a new sub company called Wildlife Works Carbon which was really to bring a new  revenue stream to our work and then hopefully to conservation in general through demonstrating  the value of protecting forests and avoiding these emissions and then finding organizations  
**[0:16:28-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:16:28):**  willing to pay for that service.  So we now are 90 plus percent funded through the protection of forests, through working  with communities in endangered forests that were disappearing to try and find ways for  
**[0:16:47-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:16:47):**  the community to agree to stop destroying the forest in return for economic benefit  and we do that work now not just in Kenya but also in the DRC, the Congo which is the  second largest tropical forest on earth and probably in my opinion the next big battlefront.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:17:09):**  The Amazon and Indonesia are in the top three forests, Amazon 1, Congo Basin 2 and Indonesia  3 and they have their own unique challenges but the DRC is an emerging African country  with a large population and massive resources so our second project is in the DRC to try  
**[0:17:32-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:17:32):**  and provide a successful model for conserving the Congo Basin forest while allowing communities  to achieve their development goals.  So the model has changed although the activities that we do interestingly are essentially the  
**[0:17:48-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:17:48):**  same as they were before.  We work to create value for communities, we work to create jobs for communities, we protect  their forests on their behalf although we do not have guns.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:18:00):**  We're famous for, I suppose in some cases, vilified by the gun toting crowd for doing  our work without shooting people even though periodically we get shot at.  But we've been very successful at protecting forests with the support of communities and  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:18:18):**  therefore we generally don't need guns.  And so we have a few other projects around the world now in Cambodia that we are consulting  on with governments and other conservation NGOs to try and expand the footprint of our  
**[0:18:36-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:18:36):**  expertise beyond our own means.  And I do believe that the REDD Plus model is here to stay, I think that recent events  in the UN climate framework, for example the Paris Agreement, really cast in stone the  
**[0:18:56-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:18:56):**  participation of REDD Plus in future climate models and future climate markets, we believe.  And while some of the details are still being worked out, the momentum towards acknowledging  the value of protecting forests for climate is very obvious and that really fuels our  
**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:19:20):**  company today.  And talking about Paris, I read it was quite a tough year before Paris for you because  there was so much uncertainty around it, now looking back at 2016, did Paris really change  
**[0:19:39-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:19:39):**  conversations you have or had with companies?  Did it really shift something?  Did you sense that after Paris we're in a different chapter of this discussion or is  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:19:50):**  it still very uncertain if you look at the CO2 market basically?  No, it was really a sea change, not so much that overnight all the players, all the conservation  groups were instantly financially secure in all their efforts because of Paris, but what  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:20:13):**  is crystal clear now is the path that we're on.  The path was very unclear and the global support for that path was very unclear.  It waxed and waned significantly in the years leading up to Paris and in particular in 2016  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:20:32):**  there was a lot of uncertainty, a lot of people as you pointed out just waiting to see what  happened in Paris.  But no, we've seen, we ourselves have seen an immediate benefit from Paris, from the  
**[0:20:45-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:20:45):**  Paris Agreement in terms of, well the first one is that it's now part of the global conversation  in a way, meaning climate in a way that it never was, especially in the US which is where  I live.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:21:00):**  It has become a central theme in society here very quickly and the Paris Agreement and the  lead up and follow on to Paris really made that happen in my opinion as well as the crazy  vitriolic presidential election that we just had that played a role too.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:21:22):**  But principally, so yes, we have seen a change.  I think the path is now clear.  The timelines are still somewhat unclear.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:21:31):**  I mean these are not short term initiatives, these are long term initiatives and so the,  and they are, because they are, they originate in the UN which is essentially a club of nations,  they take, decisions take a long time and it's a very unwieldy ship to redirect.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:21:52):**  So we anticipate some turbulence in the path but the direction of the path and the outcome  and the role that forests need to play in that outcome is now pretty clear and that  is making all of our conversations with corporate clients and consumers much simpler because  
**[0:22:12-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:22:12):**  we don't have to explain the purpose of protecting forests and avoiding damaging the climate  anymore.  Yeah, the why is easy and you basically can skip and go to the what and how and have a  
**[0:22:28-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:22:28):**  more practical discussion immediately.  Exactly, yeah, exactly.  And I would say that we're still, obviously people rightly are focused on fossil fuels  
**[0:22:36-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:22:36):**  and the divestment of not just financially from fossil fuels but the divestment of our  society from fossil fuels which is a far bigger issue than the divestment financially.  And so people are rightly focused on that issue but there is a growing awareness of  
**[0:22:58-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:22:58):**  the role of forests and that if the mighty Elon Musk was able to convince the whole world  to transport people and things around the planet tomorrow using his batteries, the climate  would still be in trouble if we don't stop chopping down forests.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:23:20):**  No one's chopping down a forest to power a car today.  So the destruction of forests and the, as well as by the way the reduction of emissions  in rural agriculture and in both at commercial scale and smallholder scale, those challenges  
**[0:23:38-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:23:38):**  remain and are a little bit less discussed in the world than the fossil fuel challenge  but both are necessary, I would argue mandatory for a healthy future for the planet and the  forest and agriculture problem is a much, much more direct impact on other species which  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:24:02):**  remains my primary interest is how do we ensure that through our development and our success  as a species we don't remove all the other species from the planet and impoverish ourselves  immeasurably in the process.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:24:18):**  And probably I can see the attention for agriculture, land use, forests, etc. growing.  Of course it's not at the level of fossil fuels yet but more and more people see it  as a second essential step because it's probably one of the few areas where a lot of things  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:24:36):**  come together and you have the option to actually be a carbon sink and have all the social benefits  and all the smallholder farmers and all the wildlife and biodiversity benefits that come  with sustainable land use or regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:24:49):**  So I think it's here to stay and will only keep growing luckily.  And when you look at a year from now, so we're January 2017 now, Paris was about a year and  a bit ago, a year from now what do you hope and what do you think has changed for you  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:25:07):**  personally and business wise?  One of the first things we've seen post Paris is that, of course, let's be clear on what  Paris did.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:25:18):**  Paris created a new agreement that comes into effect in 2020 or post 2020, so 2021.  So the rules that Paris agreed on which include the benefit to society of protecting forests  and avoiding emissions from the destruction of forests, those benefits will only accrue  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:25:42):**  officially from 2021.  But what we've seen now and what has changed our world and continues to change it is that  we are now able to enter into long-term agreements with organizations that stretch from today  
**[0:25:59-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:25:59):**  into 2021.  So there are now companies that have an interest in supporting the reduction of emissions in  forests and we can talk about why they want to do that, but there are many reasons.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:26:13):**  But in general, they're acknowledging their own footprint in a way and their inability  to reduce their own footprint to zero without paying somebody else for performing the service  of reducing emissions elsewhere.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:26:28):**  That's one reason and another reason is just it's a conservation finance model that they  were already pursuing and it's just a more efficient one in their minds.  But as a result, we're getting long-term contracts where organizations will sign an agreement  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:26:42):**  for us to protect the forest and provide them with these verified emission reductions, which  is the currency of REDD+.  For multiple years through the transition towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement  
**[0:27:00-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:27:00):**  and that has been immediately helpful to us.  So we anticipate that the pressure for organizations to reduce their footprint or reduce their  net impact will just intensify as we approach the implementation year of the Paris Agreement.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:27:19):**  So we would see that the pressure on organizations to do whatever they can to contribute to a  reduction in global footprint, global carbon footprint is intensifying and will continue  to intensify.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:27:33):**  And in particular, as you pointed out in this focus on sustainable land use has really caught  on with the high volume agricultural commodity buyers or users of land for agricultural purposes.  They're recognizing that their own sustainability is dependent on the sustainability of these  
**[0:27:57-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:27:57):**  landscapes and they are now seriously engaged in conversations about how to make sure that  they can contribute to the long-term viability of these landscapes in which they source their  materials rather than be an agent of destruction to these landscapes, which of course they  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:28:20):**  would all acknowledge they have been historically.  So there's a big transition happening.  I expect it's going to accelerate over the next five years and more and more opportunities  
**[0:28:30-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:28:30):**  to provide financing for conservation of forests will arise, including the one mentioned in  the Paris Agreement itself, this sustainable development mechanism that we believe that  needs to be clearly defined in the coming years.  
**[0:28:51-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:28:51):**  So we do anticipate significant progress year by year, month by month in some cases, towards  there being a recognition of and a broader market for the kind of services we and other  conservation groups provide in protecting forests.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:29:11):**  The holy grail for us, I think, and for the planet eventually is to get beyond the idea  of avoiding deforestation and move to a place where we are valuing intact ecosystems.  There is lots of, for all the services they provide, water, climate, pollination, etc.,  
**[0:29:39-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:29:39):**  etc.  There are many, many much more intelligent folks studying the true value of natural ecosystems,  but we live in them, we work in them, and we know the tremendous range of values they  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:29:52):**  provide for local communities and for the world at large.  And eventually we need to get to a model where we're not just concerned about reducing current  emissions because hopefully we've stopped current emissions levels, but we still need  
**[0:30:08-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:30:08):**  forests and we still need for those forests to have a value in real terms, not just in  hypothetical terms or emotional or philosophical or ideological terms.  So I think the next generation of discussion will go beyond reducing emissions and towards  
**[0:30:30-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:30:30):**  avoiding future emissions by placing value on intact ecosystems, and that's some work  that we're engaged in intellectually, even though it's I think a long way off and we  have much to do just to stem the enormous number of emissions from deforestation that  
**[0:30:46-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:30:46):**  are occurring today.  And when you look at today and now in your current work, what has kept you up during  the last few months work-wise?  
**[0:30:57-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:30:57):**  Well, I must admit I had one very sleepless night on November 8th or something, whenever  the American election occurred.  Yeah, me too.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:31:11):**  You know, I think, well, we work in developing countries, we work in the Democratic Republic  of the Congo, so in December there was, you know, there is a messy transition going on  there.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:31:28):**  So things looked a little, from the current president to a Democratic successor, there  hasn't been an election for, I don't know how many years, 10 years I think.  And so that looked like it might get a little messy again in December, but to their credit  
**[0:31:44-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:31:44):**  they came up with an agreeable solution between the president and the opposition, so stability  has returned.  So because of the places we work in, we're always concerned that political instability  
**[0:31:56-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:31:56):**  that has nothing to do with the work we do or the international climate work could interfere  with our ability to do what we do and to be successful in helping rural communities.  So that kept me awake for a little while in December.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:32:13):**  And I would say that the jury is still out on whether or not the U.S. will continue to  be a leader in climate.  It's arguable whether they ever were a leader, I will add, but certainly, you know, the rhetoric  
**[0:32:25-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:32:25):**  from the Obama administration, as well as real action, was very positive in bringing  the U.S. into the fray and demonstrating that the U.S. can be a legitimate partner in the  international climate challenge.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:32:47):**  You and everybody on this podcast probably knows that the U.S. was one of very, very  few non-signatories to the Kyoto Protocol, or non-signatories, but non-ratifiers.  So having the U.S. in the Paris Agreement was critically important, and so I still occasionally  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:33:05):**  get worried about what the administration currently will do, but when you're in the  world that I inhabit, where all kinds of challenges pop up on a day-to-day basis, you tend to  just wait until they occur and then look and then try and figure out how to overcome them.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:33:21):**  So I'm not going to anticipate things that the new administration might do that will  create more challenges for us, although some of the indicators are there that they may.  I'm going to go with the logic and common sense of humanity pushing towards an inexorable  
**[0:33:41-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:33:41):**  progress on climate that will drag the U.S. administration again, kicking and screaming,  possibly this time, forward in the fight against climate.  I think that the main change that stops me from worrying too much about that issue is  
**[0:33:56-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:33:56):**  that the U.S. public now is quite engaged, although as the whole world saw, we're a  very split nation in terms of our opinions about these kinds of issues.  But there is tremendous public support, and really in the marketplace there's tremendous  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:34:16):**  support in the U.S. now for climate work.  So that doesn't worry me too much.  Ivory poaching keeps me awake, I have to admit.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:34:27):**  My love of elephants now and the threat to elephants has moved from habitat loss and  conflict with growing communities to them being slaughtered en masse for their teeth,  which is very tragic and sad again, that we as a species would go backwards.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:34:44):**  But even there, there's been some progress.  The Chinese government recently made an announcement they were going to make ivory trade illegal,  period, rather than illegal, ha ha.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:34:59):**  And so we'll see what that does to the trade.  Unfortunately, the trade is not just constrained to China these days, but they were the largest  market by far.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:35:09):**  So we hope that that will have a significant impact on the future of elephants.  But it was looking pretty grim there for elephants, and it still is to a degree in some countries,  but it was looking pretty grim for the survival of elephants in the wild two or three years  
**[0:35:25-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:35:25):**  ago.  So that gives me headaches.  We have people who are at risk in our projects trying to protect wildlife and forests, and  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:35:32):**  so that keeps me awake occasionally when something exciting, too exciting, happens in one of  those countries.  Otherwise, I'm fairly bullish about the work we do.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:35:46):**  We carry an enormous financial burden, having been 20 years at this game, waiting for the  world to catch on to the value of the work we do.  So I have a number of financial headaches that keep me awake from time to time, but  
**[0:36:00-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:36:00):**  we're still here and still providing some leadership, I hope, in this space.  Including, interestingly, to tie into your core theme, the work we do with rural communities  and smallholders on sustainable agriculture, historically the work on sustainable agriculture  
**[0:36:20-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:36:20):**  was focused on the sustainability of the agriculture itself.  And it's only very recently that that definition has extended to adjacent forests and wilderness.  Obviously agriculture and forests are in opposition.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:36:36):**  You can't grow very much in a forest.  So for the whole history of society, post coming out of the forest, we've been doing  our very best to get rid of forests and replace them with what we call productive agriculture.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:36:54):**  And so creating a new model.  Do you see that change now?  No.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:36:59):**  I mean, well, we're in the process of trying to lead that change, but it's a very difficult  change because it's ingrained in societies all over the world that forests are bad and  farms are good.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:37:14):**  And that if they had the capacity to destroy forests and plant more crops, they would have  done in many places of the world and we would have lost a lot more forest.  And now that technological advances are occurring and that the market truly is global and that  
**[0:37:31-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:37:31):**  organizations can source food from anywhere and China can source food from anywhere to  a large degree, that issue is really front and center again, which is how do you feed  the world without destroying more forest?  
**[0:37:45-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:37:45):**  And I think the good news is that that is the conversation now.  It isn't just how do you feed the world, although in some circles it still is.  How do you feed the world, the nine billion people that we will be regardless?  
**[0:37:58-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:37:58):**  And I think that that's understandable.  But in a great majority of people that think about these things now, the conversation is  how do we feed the world without destroying the remaining forest?  
**[0:38:09-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:38:09):**  And in fact, how is the remaining forest essential to our ability to feed the world going forward?  And that is a sea change in the thought process at an international level.  At the farm and at the smallholder level, it depends where you are, whether or not that  
**[0:38:28-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:38:28):**  change has taken place.  If you are a Congolese smallholder and you'd like to grow something that needs sunshine,  you don't like forest.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:38:38):**  So we have to try and find ways for them to get a lot of value out of the land that's  already been deforested.  But solutions need to be, in the world we are, which is in a very local place trying  
**[0:38:51-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:38:51):**  to protect a very local forest, you need a solution for that local village and that local  farmer.  It's not good enough to say there's all this deforested land in the Amazon, we don't need  
**[0:39:01-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:39:01):**  to worry about taking down another tree to feed ourselves.  Well, I'm sorry, but the guy in the Congo cannot eat from the food from the Amazon.  So these problems still exist in real terms and trying to find models that show the value  
**[0:39:18-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:39:18):**  of forests to these rural communities is still a challenge.  But to a large degree, that's where the carbon value comes in because we can show the farmers  that by protecting the intact forest, they can receive another income stream that is  
**[0:39:36-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:39:36):**  more potentially sustainable and more robust and less subject to climate risk than agriculture.  So they can continue to do agriculture and we can assist them with intensifying agriculture  on land that they have locally that they've already cleared.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:39:53):**  And we can provide access to markets where they can get a higher value for their crops  and their efforts.  But we can also subsidize their communities and build them schools and clinics and other  
**[0:40:03-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:40:03):**  things or they can do that themselves with money that they receive from protecting the  forest.  So I think that's the new, but in the international dialogue, I think there's still no great models.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:40:18):**  There are pockets of amazing work, inspirational work showing how this can work locally and  how communities really do want to be part of a solution like that in most cases.  But they have to feed themselves.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:40:33):**  And so there's still a big threat, big challenge to make that work at scale across all the  threatened forests of the world.  And what do you see as the most important barriers to scale up these small pilots or  
**[0:40:51-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:40:51):**  small examples of what's actually possible?  What is needed to scale up those to actually reach the impact we all need?  Well, let me look at the clock here.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:41:07):**  Just to say, no, I can see how much time.  I think one of my pet peeves is having come from the business community and having worked  to try and find an economic solution for our work as well as for wildlife and forests around  
**[0:41:22-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:41:22):**  the world for 20 years, I have seen lots of ideas come and go and fads and things.  And one of the things that drives me nuts is the direction that the impact investment  community has taken.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:41:37):**  And it's understandable.  These are investors.  And so for the most part, you don't start an impact investment community with activists  
**[0:41:47-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:41:47):**  because they don't have any money to invest.  You start an impact investment community with investors.  And so, yes, of course, those are investors that have a desire to be part of the solution.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:41:58):**  So they're nice investors, but they're investors.  And those investors have choices in how they invest their money.  And they want to make sure that their own fortune is sustainable so they can continue  
**[0:42:09-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:42:09):**  to invest.  So that's their first priority and maybe rightly so.  Otherwise, their role as an investor will diminish over time and disappear.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:42:19):**  So the impact investment community, the activists and I don't know who else, the creative folks  that wanted to divert investments away from unsustainable investments towards impact investments  have created a storyline which is, in my opinion, potentially very threatening to the success  
**[0:42:42-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:42:42):**  in the future.  That story is that, gee, impact investments can have all the returns of a financial, of  a traditional financial investment, plus these other bottom lines, plus social benefits and  
**[0:42:54-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:42:54):**  biodiversity benefits.  So, look, you don't have to give up anything economically and you get the benefit of doing  something great for the planet.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:43:02):**  Who would not put their money into that?  And so that's been the story in many conferences all over the world for many years now.  And so those well-intentioned investors have all said, yeah, absolutely, who would not  
**[0:43:14-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:43:14):**  do that?  Let's put our money there.  And so they all put vast amounts of money, really, into this impact investing field in  
**[0:43:23-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:43:23):**  fund after fund after fund.  And then the fund managers go out in the world looking for these deals that have the exact  same return as they would get in a traditional investment and social benefit and biodiversity  
**[0:43:42-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:43:42):**  benefit.  And they can't find them.  So because it actually costs more money to do business in weird places where you're trying  
**[0:43:50-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:43:50):**  to provide economic solutions for small villages and rural communities a long way from a market.  And so these things cost more money and have a much higher risk profile.  And therefore, they will not, they will need for an investor to be able to demonstrate  
**[0:44:07-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:44:07):**  a higher return for the investor to be interested or the investor has to be willing to offset  their financial return with the social and biodiversity return.  And to this point, the story that's been sold to them is that they don't have to make that  
**[0:44:23-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:44:23):**  compromise.  And that's damaging because it means the money is not really flowing into true impact investments.  It means that eventually, because they were sold on the idea and they made the decision  
**[0:44:32-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:44:32):**  to move money based on the idea that they would get a similar return, in the end, the  fund managers compromise, in our opinion, on the impact.  They compromise always on the social and biodiversity benefit, and maybe not horribly, I'm sure  
**[0:44:44-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:44:44):**  these are all great funds doing good work, but they're not doing aggressive work to solve  the problems that can't be solved without massive investments.  So my concern is really that that problem won't be solved until we stop telling that  
**[0:45:00-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:45:00):**  lie to the investment community and say, look, if you have the capacity, then you have to  carve off some portion of your investment portfolio and assign it to a high risk activity  that could generate a return for you that is comparable, maybe not equal to, and it  
**[0:45:19-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:45:19):**  could in some cases generate a higher return.  But that should not be why you're doing it.  Why you're doing it is to put a portion of your economic wealth to work to solve very  
**[0:45:28-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:45:28):**  hard problems that need your money and that will generate enormous social and biodiversity  benefits well beyond what any impact fund is currently delivering, and that may be able  to return a financial investment if they work.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:45:43):**  But many of them have not proven that they can work at scale, and therefore you're going  to be taking a high risk.  Until we start telling that story, I think we're not going to make as much progress as  
**[0:45:53-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:45:53):**  we need to as quickly as possible in solving some of these larger problems and scaling  them up.  And that concerns me.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:46:00):**  I think that we as a society need to find a better way to define triple bottom line.  We need to define it not as triple return for the investor, which right now when people  look at triple bottom line, they think, well, I get the same financial bottom line and then  
**[0:46:17-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:46:17):**  I get a social bottom line and a biodiversity bottom line.  Who would not make that investment?  But that's a fiction, and we need to start the conversation over with how do you value  
**[0:46:29-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:46:29):**  the social and biodiversity benefits in society, possibly even financially?  How do you value them so that an investment that generates tremendous social and biodiversity  and or biodiversity benefit is more highly prized than an investment that generates high  
**[0:46:45-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:46:45):**  financial return?  Until we figure that one out, I suspect that progress will be too slow in general, and  the lives of people like me will remain to be a significant challenge.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:46:58):**  But yeah, so that's the big challenge I see on the horizon is how do we rethink the notion  of value?  I mean, money and financial value is an entirely fictitious creation of our societies to allow  
**[0:47:14-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:47:14):**  us to function.  We need a new fictitious creation in some respects that values in real terms social  benefit and biodiversity benefits so that it's not a compromise.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:47:26):**  It's more valuable to us as a society right now.  We need to acknowledge that and somehow, but also within the realities that people have  to buy food to eat and pay for school fees and drive themselves around and all these  
**[0:47:40-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:47:40):**  other things.  So that's the challenge I think is how do we create real value in social and biodiversity  impact that is recognized in real terms that allows investors to make investment decisions  
**[0:47:53-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:47:53):**  purely on those benefits rather than secondarily on those benefits.  I think you touch on an extremely interesting point.  We've sold a lot of these funds and a lot of these impact investments as it is something  
**[0:48:09-0:48:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:48:09):**  easy as you can just do your normal investments, you put another set of glasses on and you'll  be fine.  And I think another underlying illusion is there it's easy in general to make money with  
**[0:48:22-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:48:22):**  money.  If you're just making investments and if you're just making investment, you probably will  make what X return because somebody in Instagram made so much money.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:48:33):**  And the truth is it's not easy to grow money and it's not easy in general, it's not easy  in the impact space and it's not easy in the normal economy or in the economy to make more  money with money.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:48:44):**  We only hear the success stories but the truth is most people in Silicon Valley are losing  money and we only hear the few that are doing it well and that fuels our mind like, oh,  I could also do that, which is probably not true.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:48:56):**  And if you then look at the impact investing space and you want to also make a 10X return,  it's going to be very tricky because you are, like you said, dealing with agriculture, you're  dealing with people far away from any road.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:49:07):**  And of course there are real costs, it's the real economy and the real world.  So you're happy if you get a return and if that is compensating for inflation and some  of the risk.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:49:18):**  And I think it's the illusion of easy returns in all of society is something we should also  really battle because it makes any discussion really difficult because everybody would say,  yeah, but I could get 20% there.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:49:30):**  But if you really look over long stretches of time, I mean, these returns aren't there  anyway.  But it's in people's mind that it's easy money somewhere else.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:49:40):**  So why would they invest in this case in Congo?  Right.  Yes, exactly.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:49:44):**  And if you, I mean, there are very easy ways to examine your premise because if you look  at the performance of all the fund managers and all the high net worth individual asset  managers of the world, what are they telling their clients they can receive as a long term  
**[0:50:04-0:50:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:04):**  return on their investment?  It's not 30%.  And these are people whose entire lives have been around how to make money for their clients  
**[0:50:13-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:13):**  and scouring the world for a portfolio of investments to give them the best financial  return.  And they're not generating crazy returns.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:21):**  So you look at those averages and the performance of money managers around the world and you  can get a pretty good idea of how difficult it is to actually make money with money because  they have unlimited amounts of money and unlimited access to brains and thought leadership on  
**[0:50:37-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:37):**  how to turn that money into more money.  And it is still tough.  Still they can't get it done.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:42):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:45):**  No, I mean, a story I was told by somebody in Kenya.  Our core project is in Kenya.  We've been there many years.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:50):**  In Nairobi, which is a very nice African city, it's very, very developed and has lots of  creature comforts for expatriates and is a very short distance to elephants.  So lots of people like being in Nairobi.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:51:05):**  So there are something like 89 impact funds in looking for venture deals in Nairobi.  And I had friends with some of the people involved in some of the funds and one of them  told me that, you know, it was the past three years.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:51:23):**  Between all 89 of them, they'd done two deals.  So you can imagine how much money is just sitting there looking for this.  It's a management fee.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:51:35):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just earning management fees for all these fund managers while they look for the  
**[0:51:40-0:51:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:51:40):**  Holy Grail, while they scour the landscape for this Uber of Nairobi.  Mythical beast.  Exactly.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:51:48):**  The Uber of Nairobi.  That's exactly what they're looking for.  They're looking for the Uber of Nairobi or they're looking for the Archer Daniels Midland  
**[0:51:56-0:51:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:51:56):**  of Nairobi.  You know, how to make an agricultural giant, a sustainable agricultural giant that will  generate returns in the billions for their high net worth investors.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:52:08):**  So yeah, so that's, so there's work to be done there.  I think that that money could be doing far more good if the storyline had been different.  I don't dispute that today in today's world, financial investors need the promise of a  
**[0:52:26-0:52:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:52:26):**  return and that's not, I'm not a promise of a financial return for their financial  investment but I think that their expectations need to be reset in terms of what is possible  and we need to find a way to reward them for the social and biodiversity benefit on top  
**[0:52:45-0:52:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:52:45):**  of, in real terms, on top of the financial reward if we really want to see success in  that sector.  Thank you for the last point.  
**[0:52:55-0:53:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:52:55):**  I think it's a great point to end this interview but to finalize it with one more question.  What should smart impact investors look for?  After all we heard now to become active in this space, what would you advise them?  
**[0:53:11-0:53:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:53:11):**  I would advise them to focus on the impact that they want to have.  There's no point in being in an impact investment fund if the fund isn't having the impact.  I mean there is a point, maybe it makes for great cocktail party conversation but most  
**[0:53:28-0:53:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:53:28):**  in my opinion and from the ones I've met, most of these impact investors when you get  to the source of the money, they truly want to have an impact in some aspect of life that  they have a passion for.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:53:41):**  And so my advice to them is don't lose sight of the passion you have for the impact you  desire and make that requirement the highest order requirement for some segment of your  portfolio and don't let the fund manager come back to you and say, well, I wasn't able to  
**[0:53:59-0:54:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:53:59):**  find anything because what he's essentially saying is I'm worried about my own job if  I can't deliver a financial return to you that is competitive because of what I told  you when I established the fund and I couldn't find anything that creates a competitive return  
**[0:54:16-0:54:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:54:16):**  and addresses your passion.  That's essentially the long version of what they're telling you.  So it's incumbent on the impact investor to say, all right, try again.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:54:26):**  Don't worry.  Here's a five-year contract to go find me these deals regardless of the financial return.  Yes, we can have a financial return target but I really want to see my money make an  
**[0:54:39-0:54:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:54:39):**  impact on this issue.  So go find me deals that address this issue regardless of the financial return and then  we'll have a conversation about whether or not I'm willing to accept the return risk  
**[0:54:51-0:54:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:54:51):**  etc. profile of those deals.  But really focus on the impact.  Don't think just because you're investing in an education fund that you're going to  
**[0:54:59-0:55:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:54:59):**  have high impact on education because if you've made the principle criteria of their financial  return, the fund manager will find a creative way to call it education and make the return  in order to keep their jobs.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:55:14):**  So I think a lot of the onus has to be, which is again not opposite of what they were, the  original intent, these investors wanted to have the impact.  The problem is they also wanted to get rid of the problem of finding the deals and that's  
**[0:55:27-0:55:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:55:27):**  where the dilemma occurs.  They wanted to hand off the challenge of finding those opportunities to have that impact and  in doing so they're now employing somebody to do it for them and that person has a whole  
**[0:55:39-0:55:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:55:39):**  different risk profile than the original investor.  And therein lies the dilemma.  How do you transfer that risk profile that the original investor has through the funds  
**[0:55:51-0:55:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:55:51):**  and in many cases through multiple layers of funds because the money is so big these  days in impact that there's a global education fund that invests in continental education  funds that invest in national education funds that invest in girls education funds that  
**[0:56:07-0:56:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:56:07):**  finally invest in a school.  And so how do you transfer the economic or the risk profile of the original investor  and the desire for impact first through all those layers of professional management to  
**[0:56:22-0:56:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:56:22):**  make sure that the actual investments meet the original impact desire.  That's a real challenge and I don't know the answer but I do know that the impact investors  themselves cannot delegate that responsibility.  
**[0:56:35-0:56:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:56:35):**  They cannot they need to focus on that issue if they want to see that problem solved.  Thank you so much Mike for this interview.  I'm sure we'll be checking in in the next months and years to see on the progress and  
**[0:56:50-0:56:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:56:50):**  we'll hopefully have more of these conversations.  Thank you.  You're very welcome.

After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  
**[0:58:34-0:58:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:58:34):**  and recording this podcast since 2016 we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  How have we built our decision-making framework?  
**[0:58:44-0:58:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:58:44):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees?  What questions should you ask?  
**[0:58:51-0:58:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:58:51):**  What is happening in the space?  What should you read?  What should you listen?

**[0:58:59-0:59:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:58:59):**  You the soil builders and investors in the space.  The soil builders people working in this space entrepreneurial farmers fund managers vehicle  builders crowd investing platform builders ag tech companies farm to gut food companies  
**[0:59:12-0:59:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:59:12):**  permaculture key line designers holistic management consultants etc etc people that are building  soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family  office or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work  
**[0:59:26-0:59:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:59:26):**  through foundations institutional capital banks insurance companies etc.  Is this course free?  No this is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:59:36):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with very different means.  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:59:51-0:59:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:59:51):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  So what is this course?  
**[0:59:56-1:00:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:59:56):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  so you don't have to write along.  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[1:00:09-1:00:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=1:00:09):**  is so risky how to invest what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build what to  invest in and what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[1:00:21-1:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=1:00:21):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports what  kind of interviews what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.

**[1:00:40-1:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=1:00:40):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.

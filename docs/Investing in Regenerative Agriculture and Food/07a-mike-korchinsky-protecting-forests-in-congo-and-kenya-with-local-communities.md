**[0:00:12-0:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:00:16):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:20-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:00:20):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:00:21):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:00:26):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:00:31):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:00:36):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:00:38):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:00:42):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:00:44):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:00:49):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:00:54):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:00:58):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:01:02):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further, share more interviews, there  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:01:06):**  are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:01:10):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:01:15):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:01:19):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:01:24-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:01:24):**  support me and make this happen.

**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:01:31):**  And now, without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:01:35):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:01:36):**  Welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, agriculture as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:01:40):**  In these interviews I am talking to people who are scaling up the sector, either by increasing  
**[0:01:45-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:01:45):**  the influx of capital or by working underground to scale up the enterprises underground.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:01:51):**  Why regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:01:52):**  Because so many of the world current issues come together in this subject.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:01:56):**  From drought to water scarcity, climate change, social issues, hunger, obesity all have a  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:01):**  connection to how we grow food and what we eat.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:05):**  You're gonna listen to an interview with Mike Korczynski, founder and CEO of Wildlife  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:08):**  Works.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:09):**  We're gonna discuss many things in this interview, from why agriculture is taking a more central  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:13):**  stage in the whole CO2 discussion, what Paris and the Paris Agreement did to his company,  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:18):**  and the holy grail of forest and landscape protection.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:24):**  Is that coming through to you?  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:25):**  I have...  
**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:27):**  I can hear the dog, but that's...  
**[0:02:30-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:30):**  If it does, I mean, that's Wildlife Works.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:32):**  I mean, there's of course gonna be noise of animals in the background.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:38):**  It should stop.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:39):**  As you said, we're Wildlife Works.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:40):**  They will be quiet eventually.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:42):**  Don't worry about it.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:43):**  I will start.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:44):**  So welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, agriculture as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:49):**  I'm Koen Van Zeyen, the host of today.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:51):**  And in the podcast today, I'm talking to Mike Korczynski, founder of Wildlife Works, one  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:02:55):**  of the world's leading REDD plus organizations using voluntary CO2 credits for ecosystem  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:03:00):**  restoration with local stakeholders.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:03:03):**  Welcome Mike.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:03:04):**  Thank you.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:03:05):**  Thank you very much, Koen.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:03:06):**  And to dive into immediately a personal question, why are you doing what you're doing?  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:03:12):**  The honest answer is elephants, I think.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:03:16):**  I started my love of elephants when I was, I don't know, four years old or something  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:03:21):**  and lived in a place that didn't have any, but collected lots of little elephant statues  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:03:27):**  and figurines everywhere I went with my allowance when I was a kid.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:03:30):**  And then when I was not a kid anymore and had a little bit of time and a little bit  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:03:36):**  of money, I had promised myself I would go see elephants.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:03:41):**  And so I did 20 years ago, a little over 20 years ago now, went to Africa for the first  
**[0:03:48-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:03:48):**  time and was taken aback by how astonishing elephants were.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:03:57):**  I used to say that my first reaction was jaw dropping splendor.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:04:04):**  And then very quickly, because I have an analytical background, I couldn't help but see the challenges  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:04:13):**  that they were facing.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:04:16):**  And so I, and the principal challenge 20 years ago, interestingly, was not ivory poaching.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:04:23):**  That is today's challenge for sure for elephants.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:04:26):**  But 20 years ago was a, there was a lull in poaching, but the challenge that I saw was  
**[0:04:35-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:04:35):**  a conflict with local communities in Africa that were growing again for the first time  
**[0:04:43-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:04:43):**  in many centuries, if not millennia, because of better health care and to some degree because  
**[0:04:50-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:04:50):**  of access to aid and food aid, which made the carrying capacity of the land somewhat  
**[0:05:01-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:05:01):**  irrelevant.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:05:02):**  So I could see that these growing communities were now pushing into wilderness again, probably  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:05:09):**  again for the first time in hundreds of years in some cases, and were coming into conflict  
**[0:05:15-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:05:15):**  with the wildlife and in particular with elephants, and that it struck me that in that conflict,  
**[0:05:23-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:05:23):**  which there could only be one winner, humans are very creative and aggressive as a species  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:05:30):**  when our survival is at stake.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:05:32):**  So it seemed obvious to me that a solution needed to be found where the wildlife would  
**[0:05:41-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:05:41):**  be seen as an asset to the community, not just a global asset of great value, but a  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:05:48):**  local asset, and that if we couldn't find a way to make wildlife work for local communities,  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:05:54):**  then slowly but surely the wildlife would be displaced, as it essentially has in most  
**[0:06:00-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:06:00):**  of the developed world.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:06:02):**  So I started Wildlife Works with the idea that you need to find a way to bring economic  
**[0:06:08-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:06:08):**  value to the communities from wildlife.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:06:17):**  So elephants all stemmed from the love of elephants and trying to find a way, but of  
**[0:06:22-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:06:22):**  course once I got into that puzzle in more detail, it became obvious that the communities  
**[0:06:33-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:06:33):**  had great need and that these beautiful villages and cultures across Africa and now of course  
**[0:06:40-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:06:40):**  globally are under threat equally, and that our work really revolves now mostly in these  
**[0:06:49-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:06:49):**  wilderness areas around helping communities to find a wildlife-friendly and forest-friendly  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:06:57):**  development path.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:07:00):**  And if you would describe, I'm really struck by your story, I still remember the first  
**[0:07:05-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:07:05):**  time I saw an elephant in the wild, which is I think pretty much a life-changing experience.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:07:13):**  And if you look at Wildlife Works as a company and as an idea, and maybe the initial days  
**[0:07:19-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:07:19):**  and the current days and the future, like if you look at it in three parts, what has  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:07:25):**  changed and what will change in the future, which is a very big question, I do realize  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:07:30):**  that, but hopefully you have a few big thoughts that you started with and maybe you're doing  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:07:35):**  now differently and you hopefully will do differently in the future, or your hope at  
**[0:07:40-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:07:40):**  least.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:07:41):**  Right, very much so.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:07:45):**  Things have changed significantly over the years for us.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:07:48):**  So at the beginning we were a business because I came from the business world and had had  
**[0:07:53-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:07:53):**  a couple of business efforts prior to starting Wildlife Works.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:07:59):**  So and I also felt that the conservation, charitable conservation community or the NGO  
**[0:08:08-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:08:08):**  community was doing the best it could with really quite limited funding relative to the  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:08:16):**  size of the global marketplace, the size of funding for international wildlife conservation  
**[0:08:21-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:08:21):**  is tiny, it's microscopic.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:08:24):**  And so it dawned on me that if the solution that I was going to work on was just to compete  
**[0:08:29-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:08:29):**  with those people for money and ideas, it would be a very bad idea for me.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:08:36):**  So the structure of Wildlife Works from the beginning has been structured as a business  
**[0:08:38-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:08:38):**  with the idea that we need to bring new sources, we need to do two things which I felt a business  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:08:45):**  was capable of doing.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:08:47):**  One, we need to engage the marketplace directly because as long as the multi-trillion dollar  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:08:52):**  global marketplace is trashing the planet, then the small amounts as well intentioned  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:08:58):**  as they are of charitable money and sovereign money for aid will not be able to repair the  
**[0:09:03-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:09:03):**  damage there's no question in my mind.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:09:06):**  So part of our mission was to engage the global marketplace and redirect their energy towards  
**[0:09:12-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:09:12):**  being part of the solution wherever possible, first do no harm and then be actually positive  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:09:20):**  in being part of a solution for wildlife conservation and forest conservation.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:09:25):**  So that was one aspect of what we chose to do.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:09:28):**  The other piece of it was really just a different funding stream that I didn't want to be out  
**[0:09:33-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:09:33):**  there competing with these noble organizations that have been around for many years for a  
**[0:09:41-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:09:41):**  source of funding.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:09:42):**  So we wanted to self-fund through business activities where we could provide value to  
**[0:09:48-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:09:48):**  an organization or a consumer and get paid in return and use that money as a new source  
**[0:09:56-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:09:56):**  of conservation finance.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:09:59):**  So those were the two aspects that dictated the model that we have.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:10:05):**  So we are a for-profit model, very small company still with a big reach as we like to say.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:10:14):**  In the beginning how that model was implemented, in the beginning which is 1997, the Kyoto  
**[0:10:20-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:10:20):**  Protocol did not exist.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:10:22):**  So the greenhouse gas protocols that are now part of everyday conversation were not part  
**[0:10:30-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:10:30):**  of everyday conversation.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:10:31):**  Kyoto had not happened.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:10:33):**  So at the beginning of the company we tried to find a way to tie the production of goods  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:10:41):**  in a rural community to the global marketplace.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:10:44):**  We thought gee, just imagine if every product that, I don't know, Banana Republic let's  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:10:51):**  say because they have a name that implies that they might be located in a developing  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:10:56):**  country, let's just say that every product they made was sourced in a fair trade sustainable  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:11:02):**  way from a rural community that lived with wildlife.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:11:05):**  Can you imagine the impact of all that funding going into these communities and if you could  
**[0:11:12-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:11:12):**  do it in a way where the success of the brand was dependent on protection of wildlife and  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:11:21):**  forests so that the consumer's buying and the growth of the company was dependent on  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:11:26):**  maintaining and improving the quality of the environment for wildlife and forest then you  
**[0:11:32-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:11:32):**  really have something significant and you'd set a conservation on a new course with a  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:11:39):**  new set of funding and a new relationship really with rural communities which is something  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:11:44):**  that's also was important to me that rural communities needed to be part of the solution  
**[0:11:49-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:11:49):**  and needed to feel that the solution was inclusive of them.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:11:52):**  So when we started the company, it's a long way around of saying when we started we made  
**[0:11:55-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:11:55):**  t-shirts believe it or not.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:11:58):**  We wanted to produce something in rural Kenya in an elephant sanctuary.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:12:02):**  We wanted to produce something that was not going to consume local resources in a fragile  
**[0:12:09-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:12:09):**  ecosystem so we decided not to do anything agricultural in that community.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:12:15):**  That community has some very unique characteristics related to agriculture.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:12:18):**  It's very, very dry.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:12:20):**  That's the main one.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:12:22):**  So we chose there to make products and brand them under the Wildlife Works brand and then  
**[0:12:27-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:12:27):**  sell those products to the international community and the jobs in what we call our eco-factory  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:12:34):**  which is a relatively tiny by international standards rammed earth sowing facility in  
**[0:12:40-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:12:40):**  the bush.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:12:41):**  Those jobs gave the women in the community some source of income to put their kids through  
**[0:12:47-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:12:47):**  school and we tied that back to the conservation of wildlife so the compact with the community  
**[0:12:53-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:12:53):**  was look we can't compete with the real Banana Republic or the Gap on marketing because they  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:13:00):**  spend vast sums of money convincing people to buy their goods.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:13:04):**  So we're going to need passionate loyal consumers to buy our goods because we're using their  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:13:11):**  money to protect wildlife and so that from the beginning was the model that we set up  
**[0:13:16-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:13:16):**  and that model ran for about 10 years.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:13:18):**  It's still going today.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:13:19):**  I will add that that factory is still alive and well and running but mostly we make product  
**[0:13:25-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:13:25):**  for other groups now because the idea of a fair trade factory in the middle of an elephant  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:13:33):**  sanctuary became quite interesting to a number of other companies that were trying to improve  
**[0:13:38-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:13:38):**  their environmental performance.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:13:39):**  So we do make product for other brands now and that it continues to be an important activity  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:13:46):**  of our project as far as job creation and in particular for women.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:13:51):**  Women's job creation is concerned.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:13:55):**  But about 10 years ago of course Kyoto happened in 1998.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:14:01):**  Conversations about greenhouse gases and climate change started before that but really in earnest  
**[0:14:07-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:14:07):**  at that time and then protocols were established for how we might mitigate the impacts of climate  
**[0:14:13-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:14:13):**  and among those conversations were conversations about forests and for reasons that are sad  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:14:20):**  historical reasons forests were excluded, the protected forests were excluded from the  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:14:26):**  Kyoto Protocol but conversations continued amongst conservationists about the value of  
**[0:14:31-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:14:31):**  forests in the climate fight and in roughly 2005 forests reentered the dialogue and this  
**[0:14:43-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:14:43):**  idea of REDD+, reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation came into discussion  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:14:51):**  within the UN and within the surrounding activities.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:14:56):**  And so we looked at that very closely and realized that the emerging REDD+, mechanism  
**[0:15:04-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:15:04):**  was really a very ideal financing mechanism for the work we were doing and for the work  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:15:13):**  of conservation in many cases because for a number of reasons but essentially it's a  
**[0:15:19-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:15:19):**  payment for ecosystem services or at least that was the promise and we'll come back to  
**[0:15:25-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:15:25):**  how long it's taken to fulfill on that promise but the idea of forests providing great value  
**[0:15:31-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:15:31):**  in climate mitigation and the more important idea, more urgent idea that destroying forests  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:15:39):**  accelerates climate change because it releases vast amounts of carbon stored in the trees  
**[0:15:45-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:15:45):**  into the atmosphere so instead of being an assistant in helping us mitigate the impacts  
**[0:15:52-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:15:52):**  of our human activity on the planet by absorbing carbon which is what trees do to grow, destroying  
**[0:15:59-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:15:59):**  them reverses that process and puts the carbon back in the atmosphere.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:16:02):**  So REDD+, recognized that and we decided to get behind that so in 2009 we launched a new  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:16:11):**  company, a new sub company called Wildlife Works Carbon which was really to bring a new  
**[0:16:15-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:16:15):**  revenue stream to our work and then hopefully to conservation in general through demonstrating  
**[0:16:22-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:16:22):**  the value of protecting forests and avoiding these emissions and then finding organizations  
**[0:16:28-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:16:28):**  willing to pay for that service.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:16:31):**  So we now are 90 plus percent funded through the protection of forests, through working  
**[0:16:41-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:16:41):**  with communities in endangered forests that were disappearing to try and find ways for  
**[0:16:47-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:16:47):**  the community to agree to stop destroying the forest in return for economic benefit  
**[0:16:53-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:16:53):**  and we do that work now not just in Kenya but also in the DRC, the Congo which is the  
**[0:17:00-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:17:00):**  second largest tropical forest on earth and probably in my opinion the next big battlefront.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:17:09):**  The Amazon and Indonesia are in the top three forests, Amazon 1, Congo Basin 2 and Indonesia  
**[0:17:17-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:17:17):**  3 and they have their own unique challenges but the DRC is an emerging African country  
**[0:17:23-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:17:23):**  with a large population and massive resources so our second project is in the DRC to try  
**[0:17:32-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:17:32):**  and provide a successful model for conserving the Congo Basin forest while allowing communities  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:17:39):**  to achieve their development goals.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:17:44):**  So the model has changed although the activities that we do interestingly are essentially the  
**[0:17:48-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:17:48):**  same as they were before.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:17:50):**  We work to create value for communities, we work to create jobs for communities, we protect  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:17:55):**  their forests on their behalf although we do not have guns.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:18:00):**  We're famous for, I suppose in some cases, vilified by the gun toting crowd for doing  
**[0:18:07-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:18:07):**  our work without shooting people even though periodically we get shot at.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:18:13):**  But we've been very successful at protecting forests with the support of communities and  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:18:18):**  therefore we generally don't need guns.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:18:22):**  And so we have a few other projects around the world now in Cambodia that we are consulting  
**[0:18:30-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:18:30):**  on with governments and other conservation NGOs to try and expand the footprint of our  
**[0:18:36-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:18:36):**  expertise beyond our own means.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:18:39):**  And I do believe that the REDD Plus model is here to stay, I think that recent events  
**[0:18:44-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:18:44):**  in the UN climate framework, for example the Paris Agreement, really cast in stone the  
**[0:18:56-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:18:56):**  participation of REDD Plus in future climate models and future climate markets, we believe.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:19:04):**  And while some of the details are still being worked out, the momentum towards acknowledging  
**[0:19:13-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:19:13):**  the value of protecting forests for climate is very obvious and that really fuels our  
**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:19:20):**  company today.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:19:23):**  And talking about Paris, I read it was quite a tough year before Paris for you because  
**[0:19:29-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:19:29):**  there was so much uncertainty around it, now looking back at 2016, did Paris really change  
**[0:19:39-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:19:39):**  conversations you have or had with companies?  
**[0:19:42-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:19:42):**  Did it really shift something?  
**[0:19:43-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:19:43):**  Did you sense that after Paris we're in a different chapter of this discussion or is  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:19:50):**  it still very uncertain if you look at the CO2 market basically?  
**[0:19:55-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:19:55):**  No, it was really a sea change, not so much that overnight all the players, all the conservation  
**[0:20:03-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:20:03):**  groups were instantly financially secure in all their efforts because of Paris, but what  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:20:13):**  is crystal clear now is the path that we're on.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:20:17):**  The path was very unclear and the global support for that path was very unclear.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:20:25):**  It waxed and waned significantly in the years leading up to Paris and in particular in 2016  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:20:32):**  there was a lot of uncertainty, a lot of people as you pointed out just waiting to see what  
**[0:20:37-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:20:37):**  happened in Paris.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:20:40):**  But no, we've seen, we ourselves have seen an immediate benefit from Paris, from the  
**[0:20:45-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:20:45):**  Paris Agreement in terms of, well the first one is that it's now part of the global conversation  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:20:52):**  in a way, meaning climate in a way that it never was, especially in the US which is where  
**[0:20:58-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:20:58):**  I live.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:21:00):**  It has become a central theme in society here very quickly and the Paris Agreement and the  
**[0:21:07-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:21:07):**  lead up and follow on to Paris really made that happen in my opinion as well as the crazy  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:21:17):**  vitriolic presidential election that we just had that played a role too.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:21:22):**  But principally, so yes, we have seen a change.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:21:26):**  I think the path is now clear.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:21:29):**  The timelines are still somewhat unclear.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:21:31):**  I mean these are not short term initiatives, these are long term initiatives and so the,  
**[0:21:36-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:21:36):**  and they are, because they are, they originate in the UN which is essentially a club of nations,  
**[0:21:45-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:21:45):**  they take, decisions take a long time and it's a very unwieldy ship to redirect.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:21:52):**  So we anticipate some turbulence in the path but the direction of the path and the outcome  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:21:59):**  and the role that forests need to play in that outcome is now pretty clear and that  
**[0:22:05-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:22:05):**  is making all of our conversations with corporate clients and consumers much simpler because  
**[0:22:12-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:22:12):**  we don't have to explain the purpose of protecting forests and avoiding damaging the climate  
**[0:22:19-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:22:19):**  anymore.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:22:20):**  Yeah, the why is easy and you basically can skip and go to the what and how and have a  
**[0:22:28-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:22:28):**  more practical discussion immediately.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:22:30):**  Exactly, yeah, exactly.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:22:31):**  And I would say that we're still, obviously people rightly are focused on fossil fuels  
**[0:22:36-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:22:36):**  and the divestment of not just financially from fossil fuels but the divestment of our  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:22:47):**  society from fossil fuels which is a far bigger issue than the divestment financially.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:22:52):**  And so people are rightly focused on that issue but there is a growing awareness of  
**[0:22:58-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:22:58):**  the role of forests and that if the mighty Elon Musk was able to convince the whole world  
**[0:23:08-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:23:08):**  to transport people and things around the planet tomorrow using his batteries, the climate  
**[0:23:17-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:23:17):**  would still be in trouble if we don't stop chopping down forests.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:23:20):**  No one's chopping down a forest to power a car today.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:23:24):**  So the destruction of forests and the, as well as by the way the reduction of emissions  
**[0:23:31-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:23:31):**  in rural agriculture and in both at commercial scale and smallholder scale, those challenges  
**[0:23:38-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:23:38):**  remain and are a little bit less discussed in the world than the fossil fuel challenge  
**[0:23:45-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:23:45):**  but both are necessary, I would argue mandatory for a healthy future for the planet and the  
**[0:23:54-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:23:54):**  forest and agriculture problem is a much, much more direct impact on other species which  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:24:02):**  remains my primary interest is how do we ensure that through our development and our success  
**[0:24:08-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:24:08):**  as a species we don't remove all the other species from the planet and impoverish ourselves  
**[0:24:14-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:24:14):**  immeasurably in the process.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:24:18):**  And probably I can see the attention for agriculture, land use, forests, etc. growing.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:24:24):**  Of course it's not at the level of fossil fuels yet but more and more people see it  
**[0:24:29-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:24:29):**  as a second essential step because it's probably one of the few areas where a lot of things  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:24:36):**  come together and you have the option to actually be a carbon sink and have all the social benefits  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:24:41):**  and all the smallholder farmers and all the wildlife and biodiversity benefits that come  
**[0:24:45-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:24:45):**  with sustainable land use or regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:24:49):**  So I think it's here to stay and will only keep growing luckily.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:24:54):**  And when you look at a year from now, so we're January 2017 now, Paris was about a year and  
**[0:25:01-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:25:01):**  a bit ago, a year from now what do you hope and what do you think has changed for you  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:25:07):**  personally and business wise?  
**[0:25:11-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:25:11):**  One of the first things we've seen post Paris is that, of course, let's be clear on what  
**[0:25:17-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:25:17):**  Paris did.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:25:18):**  Paris created a new agreement that comes into effect in 2020 or post 2020, so 2021.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:25:27):**  So the rules that Paris agreed on which include the benefit to society of protecting forests  
**[0:25:35-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:25:35):**  and avoiding emissions from the destruction of forests, those benefits will only accrue  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:25:42):**  officially from 2021.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:25:47):**  But what we've seen now and what has changed our world and continues to change it is that  
**[0:25:53-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:25:53):**  we are now able to enter into long-term agreements with organizations that stretch from today  
**[0:25:59-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:25:59):**  into 2021.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:26:01):**  So there are now companies that have an interest in supporting the reduction of emissions in  
**[0:26:06-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:26:06):**  forests and we can talk about why they want to do that, but there are many reasons.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:26:13):**  But in general, they're acknowledging their own footprint in a way and their inability  
**[0:26:18-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:26:18):**  to reduce their own footprint to zero without paying somebody else for performing the service  
**[0:26:26-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:26:26):**  of reducing emissions elsewhere.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:26:28):**  That's one reason and another reason is just it's a conservation finance model that they  
**[0:26:33-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:26:33):**  were already pursuing and it's just a more efficient one in their minds.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:26:36):**  But as a result, we're getting long-term contracts where organizations will sign an agreement  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:26:42):**  for us to protect the forest and provide them with these verified emission reductions, which  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:26:47):**  is the currency of REDD+.  
**[0:26:52-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:26:52):**  For multiple years through the transition towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement  
**[0:27:00-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:27:00):**  and that has been immediately helpful to us.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:27:03):**  So we anticipate that the pressure for organizations to reduce their footprint or reduce their  
**[0:27:10-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:27:10):**  net impact will just intensify as we approach the implementation year of the Paris Agreement.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:27:19):**  So we would see that the pressure on organizations to do whatever they can to contribute to a  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:27:25):**  reduction in global footprint, global carbon footprint is intensifying and will continue  
**[0:27:30-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:27:30):**  to intensify.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:27:33):**  And in particular, as you pointed out in this focus on sustainable land use has really caught  
**[0:27:41-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:27:41):**  on with the high volume agricultural commodity buyers or users of land for agricultural purposes.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:27:51):**  They're recognizing that their own sustainability is dependent on the sustainability of these  
**[0:27:57-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:27:57):**  landscapes and they are now seriously engaged in conversations about how to make sure that  
**[0:28:08-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:28:08):**  they can contribute to the long-term viability of these landscapes in which they source their  
**[0:28:14-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:28:14):**  materials rather than be an agent of destruction to these landscapes, which of course they  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:28:20):**  would all acknowledge they have been historically.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:28:25):**  So there's a big transition happening.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:28:26):**  I expect it's going to accelerate over the next five years and more and more opportunities  
**[0:28:30-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:28:30):**  to provide financing for conservation of forests will arise, including the one mentioned in  
**[0:28:38-0:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:28:38):**  the Paris Agreement itself, this sustainable development mechanism that we believe that  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:28:46):**  needs to be clearly defined in the coming years.  
**[0:28:51-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:28:51):**  So we do anticipate significant progress year by year, month by month in some cases, towards  
**[0:29:00-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:29:00):**  there being a recognition of and a broader market for the kind of services we and other  
**[0:29:07-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:29:07):**  conservation groups provide in protecting forests.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:29:11):**  The holy grail for us, I think, and for the planet eventually is to get beyond the idea  
**[0:29:18-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:29:18):**  of avoiding deforestation and move to a place where we are valuing intact ecosystems.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:29:30):**  There is lots of, for all the services they provide, water, climate, pollination, etc.,  
**[0:29:39-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:29:39):**  etc.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:29:40):**  There are many, many much more intelligent folks studying the true value of natural ecosystems,  
**[0:29:47-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:29:47):**  but we live in them, we work in them, and we know the tremendous range of values they  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:29:52):**  provide for local communities and for the world at large.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:29:55):**  And eventually we need to get to a model where we're not just concerned about reducing current  
**[0:30:02-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:30:02):**  emissions because hopefully we've stopped current emissions levels, but we still need  
**[0:30:08-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:30:08):**  forests and we still need for those forests to have a value in real terms, not just in  
**[0:30:17-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:30:17):**  hypothetical terms or emotional or philosophical or ideological terms.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:30:23):**  So I think the next generation of discussion will go beyond reducing emissions and towards  
**[0:30:30-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:30:30):**  avoiding future emissions by placing value on intact ecosystems, and that's some work  
**[0:30:34-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:30:34):**  that we're engaged in intellectually, even though it's I think a long way off and we  
**[0:30:40-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:30:40):**  have much to do just to stem the enormous number of emissions from deforestation that  
**[0:30:46-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:30:46):**  are occurring today.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:30:49):**  And when you look at today and now in your current work, what has kept you up during  
**[0:30:55-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:30:55):**  the last few months work-wise?  
**[0:30:57-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:30:57):**  Well, I must admit I had one very sleepless night on November 8th or something, whenever  
**[0:31:05-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:31:05):**  the American election occurred.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:31:07):**  Yeah, me too.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:31:11):**  You know, I think, well, we work in developing countries, we work in the Democratic Republic  
**[0:31:18-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:31:18):**  of the Congo, so in December there was, you know, there is a messy transition going on  
**[0:31:24-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:31:24):**  there.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:31:28):**  So things looked a little, from the current president to a Democratic successor, there  
**[0:31:33-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:31:33):**  hasn't been an election for, I don't know how many years, 10 years I think.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:31:39):**  And so that looked like it might get a little messy again in December, but to their credit  
**[0:31:44-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:31:44):**  they came up with an agreeable solution between the president and the opposition, so stability  
**[0:31:51-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:31:51):**  has returned.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:31:52):**  So because of the places we work in, we're always concerned that political instability  
**[0:31:56-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:31:56):**  that has nothing to do with the work we do or the international climate work could interfere  
**[0:32:02-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:32:02):**  with our ability to do what we do and to be successful in helping rural communities.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:32:09):**  So that kept me awake for a little while in December.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:32:13):**  And I would say that the jury is still out on whether or not the U.S. will continue to  
**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:32:16):**  be a leader in climate.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:32:19):**  It's arguable whether they ever were a leader, I will add, but certainly, you know, the rhetoric  
**[0:32:25-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:32:25):**  from the Obama administration, as well as real action, was very positive in bringing  
**[0:32:34-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:32:34):**  the U.S. into the fray and demonstrating that the U.S. can be a legitimate partner in the  
**[0:32:43-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:32:43):**  international climate challenge.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:32:47):**  You and everybody on this podcast probably knows that the U.S. was one of very, very  
**[0:32:53-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:32:53):**  few non-signatories to the Kyoto Protocol, or non-signatories, but non-ratifiers.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:32:59):**  So having the U.S. in the Paris Agreement was critically important, and so I still occasionally  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:33:05):**  get worried about what the administration currently will do, but when you're in the  
**[0:33:11-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:33:11):**  world that I inhabit, where all kinds of challenges pop up on a day-to-day basis, you tend to  
**[0:33:17-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:33:17):**  just wait until they occur and then look and then try and figure out how to overcome them.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:33:21):**  So I'm not going to anticipate things that the new administration might do that will  
**[0:33:26-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:33:26):**  create more challenges for us, although some of the indicators are there that they may.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:33:33):**  I'm going to go with the logic and common sense of humanity pushing towards an inexorable  
**[0:33:41-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:33:41):**  progress on climate that will drag the U.S. administration again, kicking and screaming,  
**[0:33:47-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:33:47):**  possibly this time, forward in the fight against climate.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:33:52):**  I think that the main change that stops me from worrying too much about that issue is  
**[0:33:56-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:33:56):**  that the U.S. public now is quite engaged, although as the whole world saw, we're a  
**[0:34:03-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:34:03):**  very split nation in terms of our opinions about these kinds of issues.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:34:10):**  But there is tremendous public support, and really in the marketplace there's tremendous  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:34:16):**  support in the U.S. now for climate work.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:34:22):**  So that doesn't worry me too much.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:34:26):**  Ivory poaching keeps me awake, I have to admit.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:34:27):**  My love of elephants now and the threat to elephants has moved from habitat loss and  
**[0:34:33-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:34:33):**  conflict with growing communities to them being slaughtered en masse for their teeth,  
**[0:34:38-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:34:38):**  which is very tragic and sad again, that we as a species would go backwards.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:34:44):**  But even there, there's been some progress.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:34:50):**  The Chinese government recently made an announcement they were going to make ivory trade illegal,  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:34:54):**  period, rather than illegal, ha ha.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:34:59):**  And so we'll see what that does to the trade.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:35:02):**  Unfortunately, the trade is not just constrained to China these days, but they were the largest  
**[0:35:08-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:35:08):**  market by far.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:35:09):**  So we hope that that will have a significant impact on the future of elephants.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:35:15):**  But it was looking pretty grim there for elephants, and it still is to a degree in some countries,  
**[0:35:20-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:35:20):**  but it was looking pretty grim for the survival of elephants in the wild two or three years  
**[0:35:25-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:35:25):**  ago.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:35:26):**  So that gives me headaches.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:35:28):**  We have people who are at risk in our projects trying to protect wildlife and forests, and  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:35:32):**  so that keeps me awake occasionally when something exciting, too exciting, happens in one of  
**[0:35:38-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:35:38):**  those countries.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:35:39):**  Otherwise, I'm fairly bullish about the work we do.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:35:46):**  We carry an enormous financial burden, having been 20 years at this game, waiting for the  
**[0:35:50-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:35:50):**  world to catch on to the value of the work we do.  
**[0:35:53-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:35:53):**  So I have a number of financial headaches that keep me awake from time to time, but  
**[0:36:00-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:36:00):**  we're still here and still providing some leadership, I hope, in this space.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:36:05):**  Including, interestingly, to tie into your core theme, the work we do with rural communities  
**[0:36:14-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:36:14):**  and smallholders on sustainable agriculture, historically the work on sustainable agriculture  
**[0:36:20-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:36:20):**  was focused on the sustainability of the agriculture itself.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:36:25):**  And it's only very recently that that definition has extended to adjacent forests and wilderness.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:36:33):**  Obviously agriculture and forests are in opposition.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:36:36):**  You can't grow very much in a forest.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:36:38):**  So for the whole history of society, post coming out of the forest, we've been doing  
**[0:36:46-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:36:46):**  our very best to get rid of forests and replace them with what we call productive agriculture.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:36:54):**  And so creating a new model.  
**[0:36:57-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:36:57):**  Do you see that change now?  
**[0:36:58-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:36:58):**  No.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:36:59):**  I mean, well, we're in the process of trying to lead that change, but it's a very difficult  
**[0:37:04-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:37:04):**  change because it's ingrained in societies all over the world that forests are bad and  
**[0:37:12-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:37:12):**  farms are good.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:37:14):**  And that if they had the capacity to destroy forests and plant more crops, they would have  
**[0:37:21-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:37:21):**  done in many places of the world and we would have lost a lot more forest.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:37:24):**  And now that technological advances are occurring and that the market truly is global and that  
**[0:37:31-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:37:31):**  organizations can source food from anywhere and China can source food from anywhere to  
**[0:37:36-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:37:36):**  a large degree, that issue is really front and center again, which is how do you feed  
**[0:37:41-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:37:41):**  the world without destroying more forest?  
**[0:37:45-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:37:45):**  And I think the good news is that that is the conversation now.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:37:50):**  It isn't just how do you feed the world, although in some circles it still is.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:37:54):**  How do you feed the world, the nine billion people that we will be regardless?  
**[0:37:58-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:37:58):**  And I think that that's understandable.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:38:02):**  But in a great majority of people that think about these things now, the conversation is  
**[0:38:07-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:38:07):**  how do we feed the world without destroying the remaining forest?  
**[0:38:09-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:38:09):**  And in fact, how is the remaining forest essential to our ability to feed the world going forward?  
**[0:38:17-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:38:17):**  And that is a sea change in the thought process at an international level.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:38:22):**  At the farm and at the smallholder level, it depends where you are, whether or not that  
**[0:38:28-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:38:28):**  change has taken place.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:38:29):**  If you are a Congolese smallholder and you'd like to grow something that needs sunshine,  
**[0:38:35-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:38:35):**  you don't like forest.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:38:38):**  So we have to try and find ways for them to get a lot of value out of the land that's  
**[0:38:43-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:38:43):**  already been deforested.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:38:46):**  But solutions need to be, in the world we are, which is in a very local place trying  
**[0:38:51-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:38:51):**  to protect a very local forest, you need a solution for that local village and that local  
**[0:38:56-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:38:56):**  farmer.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:38:57):**  It's not good enough to say there's all this deforested land in the Amazon, we don't need  
**[0:39:01-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:39:01):**  to worry about taking down another tree to feed ourselves.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:39:04):**  Well, I'm sorry, but the guy in the Congo cannot eat from the food from the Amazon.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:39:10):**  So these problems still exist in real terms and trying to find models that show the value  
**[0:39:18-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:39:18):**  of forests to these rural communities is still a challenge.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:39:23):**  But to a large degree, that's where the carbon value comes in because we can show the farmers  
**[0:39:30-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:39:30):**  that by protecting the intact forest, they can receive another income stream that is  
**[0:39:36-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:39:36):**  more potentially sustainable and more robust and less subject to climate risk than agriculture.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:39:44):**  So they can continue to do agriculture and we can assist them with intensifying agriculture  
**[0:39:49-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:39:49):**  on land that they have locally that they've already cleared.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:39:53):**  And we can provide access to markets where they can get a higher value for their crops  
**[0:39:57-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:39:57):**  and their efforts.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:39:59):**  But we can also subsidize their communities and build them schools and clinics and other  
**[0:40:03-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:40:03):**  things or they can do that themselves with money that they receive from protecting the  
**[0:40:09-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:40:09):**  forest.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:40:10):**  So I think that's the new, but in the international dialogue, I think there's still no great models.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:40:18):**  There are pockets of amazing work, inspirational work showing how this can work locally and  
**[0:40:24-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:40:24):**  how communities really do want to be part of a solution like that in most cases.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:40:31):**  But they have to feed themselves.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:40:33):**  And so there's still a big threat, big challenge to make that work at scale across all the  
**[0:40:41-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:40:41):**  threatened forests of the world.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:40:45):**  And what do you see as the most important barriers to scale up these small pilots or  
**[0:40:51-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:40:51):**  small examples of what's actually possible?  
**[0:40:55-0:41:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:40:55):**  What is needed to scale up those to actually reach the impact we all need?  
**[0:41:01-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:41:01):**  Well, let me look at the clock here.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:41:07):**  Just to say, no, I can see how much time.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:41:10):**  I think one of my pet peeves is having come from the business community and having worked  
**[0:41:17-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:41:17):**  to try and find an economic solution for our work as well as for wildlife and forests around  
**[0:41:22-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:41:22):**  the world for 20 years, I have seen lots of ideas come and go and fads and things.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:41:27):**  And one of the things that drives me nuts is the direction that the impact investment  
**[0:41:32-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:41:32):**  community has taken.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:41:37):**  And it's understandable.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:41:39):**  These are investors.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:41:40):**  And so for the most part, you don't start an impact investment community with activists  
**[0:41:47-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:41:47):**  because they don't have any money to invest.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:41:49):**  You start an impact investment community with investors.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:41:53):**  And so, yes, of course, those are investors that have a desire to be part of the solution.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:41:58):**  So they're nice investors, but they're investors.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:42:01):**  And those investors have choices in how they invest their money.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:42:06):**  And they want to make sure that their own fortune is sustainable so they can continue  
**[0:42:09-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:42:09):**  to invest.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:42:10):**  So that's their first priority and maybe rightly so.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:42:14):**  Otherwise, their role as an investor will diminish over time and disappear.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:42:19):**  So the impact investment community, the activists and I don't know who else, the creative folks  
**[0:42:25-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:42:25):**  that wanted to divert investments away from unsustainable investments towards impact investments  
**[0:42:35-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:42:35):**  have created a storyline which is, in my opinion, potentially very threatening to the success  
**[0:42:42-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:42:42):**  in the future.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:42:43):**  That story is that, gee, impact investments can have all the returns of a financial, of  
**[0:42:49-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:42:49):**  a traditional financial investment, plus these other bottom lines, plus social benefits and  
**[0:42:54-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:42:54):**  biodiversity benefits.  
**[0:42:55-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:42:55):**  So, look, you don't have to give up anything economically and you get the benefit of doing  
**[0:43:01-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:43:01):**  something great for the planet.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:43:02):**  Who would not put their money into that?  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:43:05):**  And so that's been the story in many conferences all over the world for many years now.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:43:10):**  And so those well-intentioned investors have all said, yeah, absolutely, who would not  
**[0:43:14-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:43:14):**  do that?  
**[0:43:15-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:43:15):**  Let's put our money there.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:43:17):**  And so they all put vast amounts of money, really, into this impact investing field in  
**[0:43:23-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:43:23):**  fund after fund after fund.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:43:26):**  And then the fund managers go out in the world looking for these deals that have the exact  
**[0:43:33-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:43:33):**  same return as they would get in a traditional investment and social benefit and biodiversity  
**[0:43:42-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:43:42):**  benefit.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:43:43):**  And they can't find them.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:43:46):**  So because it actually costs more money to do business in weird places where you're trying  
**[0:43:50-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:43:50):**  to provide economic solutions for small villages and rural communities a long way from a market.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:43:57):**  And so these things cost more money and have a much higher risk profile.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:44:01):**  And therefore, they will not, they will need for an investor to be able to demonstrate  
**[0:44:07-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:44:07):**  a higher return for the investor to be interested or the investor has to be willing to offset  
**[0:44:14-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:44:14):**  their financial return with the social and biodiversity return.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:44:19):**  And to this point, the story that's been sold to them is that they don't have to make that  
**[0:44:23-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:44:23):**  compromise.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:44:24):**  And that's damaging because it means the money is not really flowing into true impact investments.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:44:28):**  It means that eventually, because they were sold on the idea and they made the decision  
**[0:44:32-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:44:32):**  to move money based on the idea that they would get a similar return, in the end, the  
**[0:44:36-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:44:36):**  fund managers compromise, in our opinion, on the impact.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:44:39):**  They compromise always on the social and biodiversity benefit, and maybe not horribly, I'm sure  
**[0:44:44-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:44:44):**  these are all great funds doing good work, but they're not doing aggressive work to solve  
**[0:44:50-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:44:50):**  the problems that can't be solved without massive investments.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:44:55):**  So my concern is really that that problem won't be solved until we stop telling that  
**[0:45:00-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:45:00):**  lie to the investment community and say, look, if you have the capacity, then you have to  
**[0:45:05-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:45:05):**  carve off some portion of your investment portfolio and assign it to a high risk activity  
**[0:45:12-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:45:12):**  that could generate a return for you that is comparable, maybe not equal to, and it  
**[0:45:19-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:45:19):**  could in some cases generate a higher return.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:45:21):**  But that should not be why you're doing it.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:45:24):**  Why you're doing it is to put a portion of your economic wealth to work to solve very  
**[0:45:28-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:45:28):**  hard problems that need your money and that will generate enormous social and biodiversity  
**[0:45:34-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:45:34):**  benefits well beyond what any impact fund is currently delivering, and that may be able  
**[0:45:41-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:45:41):**  to return a financial investment if they work.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:45:43):**  But many of them have not proven that they can work at scale, and therefore you're going  
**[0:45:48-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:45:48):**  to be taking a high risk.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:45:49):**  Until we start telling that story, I think we're not going to make as much progress as  
**[0:45:53-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:45:53):**  we need to as quickly as possible in solving some of these larger problems and scaling  
**[0:45:58-0:45:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:45:58):**  them up.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:45:59):**  And that concerns me.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:46:00):**  I think that we as a society need to find a better way to define triple bottom line.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:46:06):**  We need to define it not as triple return for the investor, which right now when people  
**[0:46:13-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:46:13):**  look at triple bottom line, they think, well, I get the same financial bottom line and then  
**[0:46:17-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:46:17):**  I get a social bottom line and a biodiversity bottom line.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:46:21):**  Who would not make that investment?  
**[0:46:22-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:46:22):**  But that's a fiction, and we need to start the conversation over with how do you value  
**[0:46:29-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:46:29):**  the social and biodiversity benefits in society, possibly even financially?  
**[0:46:34-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:46:34):**  How do you value them so that an investment that generates tremendous social and biodiversity  
**[0:46:40-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:46:40):**  and or biodiversity benefit is more highly prized than an investment that generates high  
**[0:46:45-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:46:45):**  financial return?  
**[0:46:47-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:46:47):**  Until we figure that one out, I suspect that progress will be too slow in general, and  
**[0:46:53-0:46:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:46:53):**  the lives of people like me will remain to be a significant challenge.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:46:58):**  But yeah, so that's the big challenge I see on the horizon is how do we rethink the notion  
**[0:47:06-0:47:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:47:06):**  of value?  
**[0:47:07-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:47:07):**  I mean, money and financial value is an entirely fictitious creation of our societies to allow  
**[0:47:14-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:47:14):**  us to function.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:47:16):**  We need a new fictitious creation in some respects that values in real terms social  
**[0:47:21-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:47:21):**  benefit and biodiversity benefits so that it's not a compromise.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:47:26):**  It's more valuable to us as a society right now.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:47:28):**  We need to acknowledge that and somehow, but also within the realities that people have  
**[0:47:33-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:47:33):**  to buy food to eat and pay for school fees and drive themselves around and all these  
**[0:47:40-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:47:40):**  other things.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:47:41):**  So that's the challenge I think is how do we create real value in social and biodiversity  
**[0:47:47-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:47:47):**  impact that is recognized in real terms that allows investors to make investment decisions  
**[0:47:53-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:47:53):**  purely on those benefits rather than secondarily on those benefits.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:48:01):**  I think you touch on an extremely interesting point.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:48:04):**  We've sold a lot of these funds and a lot of these impact investments as it is something  
**[0:48:09-0:48:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:48:09):**  easy as you can just do your normal investments, you put another set of glasses on and you'll  
**[0:48:14-0:48:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:48:14):**  be fine.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:48:15):**  And I think another underlying illusion is there it's easy in general to make money with  
**[0:48:22-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:48:22):**  money.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:48:23):**  If you're just making investments and if you're just making investment, you probably will  
**[0:48:27-0:48:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:48:27):**  make what X return because somebody in Instagram made so much money.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:48:33):**  And the truth is it's not easy to grow money and it's not easy in general, it's not easy  
**[0:48:37-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:48:37):**  in the impact space and it's not easy in the normal economy or in the economy to make more  
**[0:48:43-0:48:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:48:43):**  money with money.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:48:44):**  We only hear the success stories but the truth is most people in Silicon Valley are losing  
**[0:48:48-0:48:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:48:48):**  money and we only hear the few that are doing it well and that fuels our mind like, oh,  
**[0:48:54-0:48:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:48:54):**  I could also do that, which is probably not true.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:48:56):**  And if you then look at the impact investing space and you want to also make a 10X return,  
**[0:49:01-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:49:01):**  it's going to be very tricky because you are, like you said, dealing with agriculture, you're  
**[0:49:05-0:49:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:49:05):**  dealing with people far away from any road.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:49:07):**  And of course there are real costs, it's the real economy and the real world.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:49:10):**  So you're happy if you get a return and if that is compensating for inflation and some  
**[0:49:17-0:49:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:49:17):**  of the risk.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:49:18):**  And I think it's the illusion of easy returns in all of society is something we should also  
**[0:49:24-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:49:24):**  really battle because it makes any discussion really difficult because everybody would say,  
**[0:49:28-0:49:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:49:28):**  yeah, but I could get 20% there.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:49:30):**  But if you really look over long stretches of time, I mean, these returns aren't there  
**[0:49:35-0:49:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:49:35):**  anyway.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:49:37):**  But it's in people's mind that it's easy money somewhere else.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:49:40):**  So why would they invest in this case in Congo?  
**[0:49:42-0:49:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:49:42):**  Right.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:49:43):**  Yes, exactly.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:49:44):**  And if you, I mean, there are very easy ways to examine your premise because if you look  
**[0:49:52-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:49:52):**  at the performance of all the fund managers and all the high net worth individual asset  
**[0:49:58-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:49:58):**  managers of the world, what are they telling their clients they can receive as a long term  
**[0:50:04-0:50:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:04):**  return on their investment?  
**[0:50:06-0:50:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:06):**  It's not 30%.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:08):**  And these are people whose entire lives have been around how to make money for their clients  
**[0:50:13-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:13):**  and scouring the world for a portfolio of investments to give them the best financial  
**[0:50:18-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:18):**  return.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:19):**  And they're not generating crazy returns.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:21):**  So you look at those averages and the performance of money managers around the world and you  
**[0:50:26-0:50:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:26):**  can get a pretty good idea of how difficult it is to actually make money with money because  
**[0:50:31-0:50:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:31):**  they have unlimited amounts of money and unlimited access to brains and thought leadership on  
**[0:50:37-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:37):**  how to turn that money into more money.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:39):**  And it is still tough.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:41):**  Still they can't get it done.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:45):**  No, I mean, a story I was told by somebody in Kenya.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:47):**  Our core project is in Kenya.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:48):**  We've been there many years.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:50):**  In Nairobi, which is a very nice African city, it's very, very developed and has lots of  
**[0:50:55-0:51:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:50:55):**  creature comforts for expatriates and is a very short distance to elephants.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:51:00):**  So lots of people like being in Nairobi.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:51:05):**  So there are something like 89 impact funds in looking for venture deals in Nairobi.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:51:14):**  And I had friends with some of the people involved in some of the funds and one of them  
**[0:51:19-0:51:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:51:19):**  told me that, you know, it was the past three years.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:51:23):**  Between all 89 of them, they'd done two deals.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:51:28):**  So you can imagine how much money is just sitting there looking for this.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:51:34):**  It's a management fee.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:51:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:51:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:51:37):**  It's just earning management fees for all these fund managers while they look for the  
**[0:51:40-0:51:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:51:40):**  Holy Grail, while they scour the landscape for this Uber of Nairobi.  
**[0:51:46-0:51:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:51:46):**  Mythical beast.  
**[0:51:47-0:51:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:51:47):**  Exactly.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:51:48):**  The Uber of Nairobi.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:51:49):**  That's exactly what they're looking for.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:51:50):**  They're looking for the Uber of Nairobi or they're looking for the Archer Daniels Midland  
**[0:51:56-0:51:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:51:56):**  of Nairobi.  
**[0:51:57-0:52:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:51:57):**  You know, how to make an agricultural giant, a sustainable agricultural giant that will  
**[0:52:03-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:52:03):**  generate returns in the billions for their high net worth investors.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:52:08):**  So yeah, so that's, so there's work to be done there.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:52:11):**  I think that that money could be doing far more good if the storyline had been different.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:52:18):**  I don't dispute that today in today's world, financial investors need the promise of a  
**[0:52:26-0:52:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:52:26):**  return and that's not, I'm not a promise of a financial return for their financial  
**[0:52:31-0:52:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:52:31):**  investment but I think that their expectations need to be reset in terms of what is possible  
**[0:52:38-0:52:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:52:38):**  and we need to find a way to reward them for the social and biodiversity benefit on top  
**[0:52:45-0:52:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:52:45):**  of, in real terms, on top of the financial reward if we really want to see success in  
**[0:52:52-0:52:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:52:52):**  that sector.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:52:53):**  Thank you for the last point.  
**[0:52:55-0:53:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:52:55):**  I think it's a great point to end this interview but to finalize it with one more question.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:53:03):**  What should smart impact investors look for?  
**[0:53:05-0:53:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:53:05):**  After all we heard now to become active in this space, what would you advise them?  
**[0:53:11-0:53:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:53:11):**  I would advise them to focus on the impact that they want to have.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:53:17):**  There's no point in being in an impact investment fund if the fund isn't having the impact.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:53:21):**  I mean there is a point, maybe it makes for great cocktail party conversation but most  
**[0:53:28-0:53:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:53:28):**  in my opinion and from the ones I've met, most of these impact investors when you get  
**[0:53:33-0:53:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:53:33):**  to the source of the money, they truly want to have an impact in some aspect of life that  
**[0:53:38-0:53:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:53:38):**  they have a passion for.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:53:41):**  And so my advice to them is don't lose sight of the passion you have for the impact you  
**[0:53:47-0:53:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:53:47):**  desire and make that requirement the highest order requirement for some segment of your  
**[0:53:55-0:53:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:53:55):**  portfolio and don't let the fund manager come back to you and say, well, I wasn't able to  
**[0:53:59-0:54:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:53:59):**  find anything because what he's essentially saying is I'm worried about my own job if  
**[0:54:06-0:54:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:54:06):**  I can't deliver a financial return to you that is competitive because of what I told  
**[0:54:11-0:54:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:54:11):**  you when I established the fund and I couldn't find anything that creates a competitive return  
**[0:54:16-0:54:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:54:16):**  and addresses your passion.  
**[0:54:18-0:54:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:54:18):**  That's essentially the long version of what they're telling you.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:54:21):**  So it's incumbent on the impact investor to say, all right, try again.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:54:26):**  Don't worry.  
**[0:54:27-0:54:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:54:27):**  Here's a five-year contract to go find me these deals regardless of the financial return.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:54:32):**  Yes, we can have a financial return target but I really want to see my money make an  
**[0:54:39-0:54:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:54:39):**  impact on this issue.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:54:41):**  So go find me deals that address this issue regardless of the financial return and then  
**[0:54:45-0:54:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:54:45):**  we'll have a conversation about whether or not I'm willing to accept the return risk  
**[0:54:51-0:54:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:54:51):**  etc. profile of those deals.  
**[0:54:53-0:54:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:54:53):**  But really focus on the impact.  
**[0:54:56-0:54:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:54:56):**  Don't think just because you're investing in an education fund that you're going to  
**[0:54:59-0:55:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:54:59):**  have high impact on education because if you've made the principle criteria of their financial  
**[0:55:05-0:55:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:55:05):**  return, the fund manager will find a creative way to call it education and make the return  
**[0:55:11-0:55:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:55:11):**  in order to keep their jobs.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:55:14):**  So I think a lot of the onus has to be, which is again not opposite of what they were, the  
**[0:55:20-0:55:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:55:20):**  original intent, these investors wanted to have the impact.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:55:23):**  The problem is they also wanted to get rid of the problem of finding the deals and that's  
**[0:55:27-0:55:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:55:27):**  where the dilemma occurs.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:55:29):**  They wanted to hand off the challenge of finding those opportunities to have that impact and  
**[0:55:35-0:55:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:55:35):**  in doing so they're now employing somebody to do it for them and that person has a whole  
**[0:55:39-0:55:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:55:39):**  different risk profile than the original investor.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:55:43):**  And therein lies the dilemma.  
**[0:55:45-0:55:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:55:45):**  How do you transfer that risk profile that the original investor has through the funds  
**[0:55:51-0:55:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:55:51):**  and in many cases through multiple layers of funds because the money is so big these  
**[0:55:54-0:56:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:55:54):**  days in impact that there's a global education fund that invests in continental education  
**[0:56:01-0:56:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:56:01):**  funds that invest in national education funds that invest in girls education funds that  
**[0:56:07-0:56:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:56:07):**  finally invest in a school.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:56:09):**  And so how do you transfer the economic or the risk profile of the original investor  
**[0:56:16-0:56:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:56:16):**  and the desire for impact first through all those layers of professional management to  
**[0:56:22-0:56:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:56:22):**  make sure that the actual investments meet the original impact desire.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:56:26):**  That's a real challenge and I don't know the answer but I do know that the impact investors  
**[0:56:31-0:56:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:56:31):**  themselves cannot delegate that responsibility.  
**[0:56:35-0:56:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:56:35):**  They cannot they need to focus on that issue if they want to see that problem solved.  
**[0:56:42-0:56:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:56:42):**  Thank you so much Mike for this interview.

**[0:58:15-0:58:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:58:15):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food.

**[0:58:25-0:58:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/#t=0:58:25):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question

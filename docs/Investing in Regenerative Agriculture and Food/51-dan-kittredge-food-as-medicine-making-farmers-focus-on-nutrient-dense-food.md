**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com slash course or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:14):**  This interview is about quality, nutrient density and flavor of food and their connection  with soil health and human health.  I think it's safe to say that if Dan and the team at the Bionutrient Food Association  
**[0:00:24-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:24):**  get it right, they will change the entire food and agriculture sector for the better.  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:37):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:51):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:00):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  In March last year, we launched our Patreon community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:13-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:13):**  our work.  And so many of you have joined as a member.  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:21):**  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.  For more information on the different tiers, benefits and how to become a member, check  patreon.com slash regenerative agriculture or find the link below.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:33):**  Thank you.  Welcome to another episode of the podcast.  I'm Kool Mosein, your host.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:38):**  And today interview Dan Kittredge, organic farmer, founder of the Bio-nutrient Food Association,  working hard to demonstrate the connections between plant health, soil health, carbon  sequestration, crop nutrition value, flavor and human health.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:51):**  Welcome Dan.  Thank you for having me.  And to start with a personal question, why soil?  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:57):**  Why the real food campaign, which we will dive deeper into what brought you to the place  where you are now as a founder of the Bio-nutrient Food Association?  Very long question and long answer, obviously, but let's try to keep it short.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:11):**  Potentially that's a long answer.  In short, my background as an organic farmer, growing up on an organic farm and also having  my parents run an organic farming organization, gave me perspective when I tried to set off  
**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:25):**  and have my own farm about how much I knew and didn't know about how to make a living  farming.  A lot of this work started from a very practical standpoint, which was the techniques and principles  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:39):**  that I had been trained in were not sufficient to produce healthy plants.  And if your plants are sick, your cost of production is high and you have a hard time  making a living.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:49):**  So I started just very pragmatically on how to produce plants that are more healthy by  attending conferences and seminars, reading books, and in short order found that I was  able to, without much changing of what I was doing, deeper understanding, really profoundly  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:10):**  affect the health of my plants, which correlated with better yields, better pest and disease  resistance and better economic viability.  And as I got into it further, the connections between soil building, carbon sequestration,  
**[0:03:25-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:25):**  flavor aroma, shelf life, human health, all seemed to be tied intimately into this same  deeper understanding.  And so I started to give workshops at conferences and then courses and then this functionally  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:41):**  evolved into this Bio-Nutrient Food Association, the organization which I'm executive director  of.  And so over the past 10 years we have built an organization that's primarily based in  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:51):**  North America, although we have plenty of allies globally.  We've got local chapters in about 15 different states and a couple provinces in Canada.  We do an annual conference.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:01):**  We do two-day intensive seminars.  And we've been working for quite some time now in helping farmers understand better how  to work with nature.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:11):**  Our basic idea is that plants have evolved to grow and the more we can manage our soils  in a fashion so that the plants are able to do what they've evolved to do, the better  it is for everybody involved.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:25):**  So a short introduction perhaps.  Yeah, but a lot to unpack there actually.  So your starting point was really organic or growing up an organic farm and being an  
**[0:04:35-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:35):**  organic farmer.  But you took it and are still taking it to a whole new level.  Does that simply mean that organic isn't good enough or was it the missing focus on  
**[0:04:47-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:47):**  plant health for instance?  What was the main starting point of that journey that you found?  It's not economically viable.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:54):**  There has to be more because many see organic as already quite radical and you're actually  going quite some steps beyond that.  Well, yeah, I like all of these terms, Christian or Democrat or Republican, depending on your  
**[0:05:10-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:10):**  framework.  It's a very broad community.  There's a bunch of different kinds of organic farmers, etc. and different understandings.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:21):**  But I think a deeper understanding of how life works has not been part of the organic  understanding.  We have, through our organization, tried to really tease out the wisdom from the organic  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:37):**  community as well as from the permaculture community and the agroecology, from biodynamics,  from conventional agriculture.  Our thought is that life is actually what's going on here and we have these different  
**[0:05:51-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:51):**  modes of understanding and working with it.  But let's be more integrated in our understanding and let's have there be some practical modes  of assessment of success.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:03):**  For one, I think if a crop is being attacked by a flesh eating fungus, that's usually a  sign of poor health.  Let's acknowledge that and say we may have organically approved fungicides but that does  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:15):**  not mean that we're producing high quality food.  It just means we're not using certain synthetic chemicals.  So the conclusion we've come to after a number of years is that really the nutritional value  
**[0:06:28-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:28):**  of the food is what matters.  The flavor, the aroma, the nutritional value correlates with the health of the person that  eats it, the health of the plant, the health of the soil and the ecosystem.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:40):**  So that would be a point around which we could potentially come together.  Just to sort of jump ahead a little bit, we've done some research now and sampled crops from  around the US and looked at some of these nutritional compounds.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:55):**  One of them, polyphenols, it's a family of compounds that correlate with sort of cancer  healing and things like that.  In our research last year, we sampled 600 carats from around the country, different  
**[0:07:10-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:10):**  stores, farmers markets, farms, organic, conventional and the nutritional variation in polyphenols  was 20,000%.  This is not a small number.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:23):**  There is a massive nutritional variation in food which correlates to the health of the  plant, correlates to the health of the human that eats it.  And so we're not saying organic is bad or conventional is bad or biodynamics is bad.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:35):**  We're saying let's integrate the wisdom from these different communities and let us be  assessed by the actual health of the food we produce and let that be the real marker,  not the label or the marketing scheme.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:48):**  Which is, I mean, it makes obviously a ton of sense.  Let's focus on the quality of the food.  What does it need to do?  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:54):**  It needs to nourish you.  So we need to look at nutrients.  But it's also a very, I wouldn't say new thought, but contradictory because you don't have certifications  
**[0:08:05-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:05):**  for that.  We finally have organic and everybody starts to know it and starts to double digit growth  in the supermarkets, et cetera.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:13):**  With the Real Food Campaign and the Bio-Nutrient Food Association on the issues of quality,  was there or is there a standard of quality or that had to be completely developed of  what we actually mean by good food?  
**[0:08:26-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:26):**  Well, the Real Food Campaign is this collaborative project that we are helping to establish,  which is working with different universities, organizations, companies, et cetera, to do  three basic things.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:42):**  One is to build a tool that a consumer can use to test quality in real time, as in flash  a light like a smartphone camera flash at a carrot and then get a reading out which  says relatively how good this is.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:57):**  So build a tool that can do that is one thing that no one's done yet, which we've got the  first generation of it out already.  The second step is to identify the variation in quality.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:08):**  And to your question, there does not seem to be any database anywhere globally that  I've been able to find at least in 10, 12 years of looking and asking people who would  know there's no database which identifies the variation in nutrient levels within a  
**[0:09:24-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:24):**  crop.  So this carrot relative to that carrot, et cetera.  And so that's what we're, to your question, we're working on is populating that database  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:35):**  so that we can begin to say something intelligent about relatively how good this carrot is versus  that carrot.  There's a third step to the campaign, a third leg of the stool as it were, which is what  
**[0:09:46-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:46):**  are the environmental conditions, which management practices, which soil types, fertility programs,  varieties of crops, microbiome dynamics, what are the environmental conditions which cause  which quality results.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:02):**  And so our long term hope is to be able to give growers the ability to shift their management  practices during the growing season based on this information so that we can functionally  increase the nutrient value of food across the board, whether it's organic or local or  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:19):**  biodynamic or whatever.  We want to support growers globally of all scales in producing food that's more nutritious  because of the profound impacts it can have on human health and environmental health.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:34):**  We can sequester all the carbon we need to bring CO2 levels back to where they were 250  years ago.  If we did agriculture well, we can do that in 10 years.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:45):**  If globally farmers started to manage their soils in such a manner as to be producing  crops that were really quite nutritious, a side benefit of that is massive drawdown of  carbon from the atmosphere into the soil.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:59):**  So yeah, the campaign is focused on the logistics of supporting consumers in purchasing food  that's more nutritious.  And we think that economic driver of consumers choosing the food that's most nutritious for  
**[0:11:14-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:14):**  them will inspire farmers to do a better job producing crops that are more nutritious.  I may have jumped ahead.  No, no, absolutely a key point, because you're saying that connection has already been shown  
**[0:11:28-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:28):**  between nutrient dense food or food that's more nutritious and soil health and dust soil  carbon.  Like there's no way to cheat that or to set up a very fancy greenhouse or vertical farm.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:42):**  Is that a rock solid connection?  Like we know if this is a very nutritious carrot, that had to be grown in a very healthy  soil?  
**[0:11:50-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:50):**  I'm sure there are ways with hydroponic systems to produce carrots that are much more nutritious  than what's on the shelf right now.  But if money is a factor, if cost of production is a piece of the puzzle, we'll never be able  
**[0:12:06-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:06):**  to do it as economically as with collaboration with microbes in the soil.  That is the most efficient way to produce crops that are highly nutritious.  If it would be an honest market system, the consumer and then there's obviously consumer  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:21):**  that wants certain things, but the consumer pooling and asking and demanding nutrient  dense carrot or nutrient dense food in general would be a very, very strong trigger for growers  and farmers that I think already in many cases, I mean, the ones that attend your conferences  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:36):**  and your sessions and your courses want to grow more nutrition than food.  But at the moment, they have no way of distinguishing themselves from the next guy or girl on the  farmer's market with carrots that look exactly the same, but are maybe completely different.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:52):**  That's what you're saying.  Yes.  And foundationally, there's this, it seems to be an assumption, an unquestioned assumption  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:00):**  in the general public, which is that all food is basically the same, that all carrots have  the same thing in them, that all milk has the same thing in it, etc.  It's basically uniform, like plastic or steel.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:13):**  It's one thing.  It's a uniform material and that is just absolutely not true.  And so that, you know, there's a major hurdle there in telling the story, explaining the  
**[0:13:25-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:25):**  fact that this variation exists.  But then if that story is told, the corollary of it is that there's a direct connection  between the nutritional value of the food that you eat and your parents ate and your  
**[0:13:35-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:35):**  grandparents ate and the diseases that you're suffering or your children perhaps are suffering.  We have epidemic levels of chronic illness anywhere where the food supply chain has gone  towards a quote unquote Western diet.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:52):**  And it has a massive amount to do with the fact that we're able to mass produce food,  but it is nutritionally quite devoid.  And so that's what most of us have been eating now for a couple of generations, maybe not  
**[0:14:04-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:04):**  in more rural areas, but at least here in North America, for a couple of generations,  we've been eating food that is devoid of nutrition and we are physiologically falling apart.  And so while I think that the climate angle is important, I think the visceral self interest  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:21):**  of your child is sick and a really good way to help your child not be sick anymore is  to feed your child food that is most nutritious.  If the cost of production is lower because you're working with nature, then it doesn't  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:34):**  have to be more expensive for the consumer.  So yeah, we think that there's a really significant opportunity here if we can engage some transparency  and some, you know, deeper understanding to rapidly shift a lot of these issues which  
**[0:14:50-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:50):**  seem to be quite serious globally.  If you think about it, it's ridiculous.  We're pushing for clean labels, et cetera, but it still says tomatoes.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:59):**  And maybe if you're lucky, I mean, I live in a country or spend a lot of time in a country  where at least the type of tomatoes is mentioned, but that still doesn't say anything about  the nutritional value.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:10):**  And even if it would be slightly more expensive, but an additional value would be double, you  could argue that it's a much cheaper product.  And probably I think you're right in terms of the pool factor of healthcare versus carbon  
**[0:15:25-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:25):**  sequestration, et cetera.  That's just much, much stronger, the healthcare part, and carbon will ever be unless you live  on an island that's about to disappear under the sea.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:35):**  There is a lot of consternation in people's minds right now, a lot of concern about the  climate, which is good.  It's about time.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:44):**  But I don't think people are really going to stop driving cars and flying airplanes.  And as far as I'm concerned, we don't have to.  All you have to do is choose the food off the shelf that is more nutritious than the  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:56):**  one next to it.  Do you have two choices of carrots to purchase, two choices of oranges, two choices of beef  or milk or rice or three or four?  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:05):**  Well, all we're saying is if you choose the one that's more nutritious, you can functionally  help reverse climate change.  Yes, that's a nice corollary, but what you're really doing is healing yourself.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:17):**  And I think it's a good story.  I think it's an absolutely brilliant story, very strong.  I think the whole regeneration piece of yourself plus the land that you're supporting by eating  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:27):**  it is probably going to be one of the main stories of this century.  But I have a but.  Do you see like in a supermarket in, let's say, the United States, if you choose one  
**[0:16:38-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:38):**  orange over another one, is there already enough supply of nutrient dense ones or are  most of them relatively the same?  What have you seen so far or is it too early to answer the question?  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:50):**  Is there enough choice for me if I walk into a random place where I normally buy my food?  There is significant variation.  I gave you the number 20,000%.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:01):**  That's the full variation that we found.  But within any grocery store, there's easily 100% or 200% variation within the crops that  are available.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:10):**  They may all still be relatively poor.  They likely are still relatively poor.  If you think of a carrot, the most nutritious carrot is 100 and something that's basically  
**[0:17:22-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:22):**  empty is one.  Most carrots are between 15 and 35.  That's where they're at.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:29):**  Or maybe it's 8 and 15.  They're relatively low but there is still a significant variation.  Our thought is that this is going to be an evolutionary process whereby people start  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:41):**  buying the 30s and start leaving the 15s on the shelf and then the people that are growing  15s realize they have to up their game.  They start to produce 35s and 40s and then their crops start to move off the shelf and  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:53):**  then the people who are doing 30s start to up their game and get to 50.  Our thought is this is a competition to the top.  If we can establish a visceral economic incentive to inspire people to compete to do better,  
**[0:18:08-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:08):**  then we have succeeded.  It will be an evolutionary evolving iterative process but that's our understanding of how  it could work.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:17):**  Stay Forever And where are you now?  We're in April 2019.  You described the campaign and we shortly touched upon the Bio-Nutrient Food Association.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:27):**  What does your week look like or your month?  What's the main thing at the moment in this huge evolution because this is a long, long-term  process and it's been a long time in the making?  
**[0:18:36-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:36):**  What's keeping you busy?  What are you working on at the moment?  What I'm working on at the moment actually is a pre-order campaign for the first generation  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:45):**  of really consumer-built mass-produced calibrated spectrometers.  We expect to be putting that out.  We have tools right now which are quite functional.  
**[0:18:56-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:56):**  Yeah, I actually ordered one.  It should come in in the next few weeks.  Maybe when this is out, it already came in and I started playing with it and sharing  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:03):**  data but I would definitely annoy anybody with that thing when it gets in.  Some people like things like that and will play around and do experiments and stuff but  our thought is for the consumer, it should be as simple and easy as possible.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:17):**  The version we have right now is not that.  The version we have now is for tinkerers and researchers and sort of activists.  We will be launching next month this campaign for pre-order of this consumer calibrated  
**[0:19:32-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:32):**  tool.  We're aiming for 10,000 units as our first serious batch.  We're going to be promising that it will be available in two years although I think likely  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:43):**  it will be less time than that but we would rather be conservative than over promise.  As an anecdote, we have a large supermarket chain in the US called Whole Foods which is  associated with being a little bit more upscale, organic, etc.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:02):**  A number of years ago when I was talking to one of the regional buyers for Whole Foods  for the northeast corner of the US about this project and this opportunity, I said, wouldn't  you like to be part of this project because then you can show that your stuff is better  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:16):**  than your competition.  They said, no, really we don't want to have any empiricals on what's going on.  However, when you are two years from the consumers being able to tell how good our stuff is,  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:32):**  please come tell us because then we'll give our growers two years to meet standard.  It's an interesting dynamic.  That's about now, right?  
**[0:20:40-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:40):**  Let's give them a fair warning.  That's what we're going to do next month is launch this and say, okay, heads up supply  chain, here we are, this is what we're doing.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:48):**  At this trajectory in two years, consumers will be able to test the variation of quality  at the grocery store, in the farmers market, in real time.  Just to give an idea, that's a little like pocket size spectrometer that you can point  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:01):**  at a carrot and tells you that what you were saying before between one and a hundred or  whatever the spectrum will be, tells you the nutrient density.  It'll probably be the size of a deck of playing cards and will probably connect to your, a  
**[0:21:18-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:18):**  little tether, a little cord, like earbuds cord.  And so, yeah, it'll be, I don't know what that size is in centimetres.  It's probably three inches by, you know, two inches by one inch or something.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:31):**  It will be small.  Yeah, that's small.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:34):**  And like any app, you know, you press the button on your phone to take the picture and  the, you know, the answer pops up on your phone right there.  So it's quite exciting.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:44):**  And our hope is that we've already gotten interest from various industries like blueberries  and coffee and milk and things like that.  Companies that are involved in that, in those, in producing those crops.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:59):**  Our thought is that we want to work with the farmers and the supply chain companies to  help them improve the quality of the crops they're producing so that when the consumers  can have this tool, that their stuff looks better.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:13):**  And just for my idea, in terms of milk and coffee, would I be pointing it at the bottle  of milk?  Would I be pointing it at the cup of coffee or would I be pointing it at the beans?  
**[0:22:23-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:23):**  How would it work?  Well, with the coffee people, we were talking about all the way up to the farmers and the  mountains and wherever it is, Peru or India that are growing it.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:34):**  Really, at the farmers level, wow.  So they could flash a leaf while the coffee bush is growing and understand how to support  the plant in being healthier.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:45):**  And then the buyers would flash the light at the raw bean and choose which beans to  purchase at what price all the way through.  So yeah, it's a, I mean, there's all kinds of opportunities here.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:58):**  There is naturally going to be a consumer tool which will give you relatively how good  this is.  And then there's going to be a business grade tool which will be more expensive, which would  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:08):**  give specific levels of specific compounds and elements.  Extremely, extremely interesting.  Yeah, let's shift gears a bit to the finance side or the investor or the impact investor  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:19):**  side of things as this podcast is listened by them as well.  What would be, I mean, you've mostly been working on, I mean, actually on the business  side and on the growing side, what does all this, this real food campaign and the focus  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:32):**  on the quality of the food, what does it mean for investors that are maybe already invested  actually in agriculture and food or are looking at that and want to basically unlock the potential  impact?  
**[0:23:44-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:44):**  What does this movement mean for them?  Well, I guess it depends on where they're invested.  We expect that there will be a, this will be fairly disruptive to the food supply chain.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:56):**  I can't imagine.  And we're doing this based on the data.  We're not trying to be evangelical about saying we have the answer.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:07):**  We're saying this is what the data tells us.  So our thought is that farmers are going to be able to understand how to grow crops more  well, which is not, which means they're not going to be using synthetic fertilizers and  
**[0:24:22-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:22):**  toxic chemicals.  You cannot produce high quality food while you're killing life.  It just doesn't work well that way.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:32):**  So we expect a profound shift in the production of food and the, you know, which genetics,  which of the varieties of crops have a better inherent potential to produce nutrient to  food.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:46):**  A lot of the seed that's been hybridized and genetically modified is not been bred for  nutritive value.  In fact, many of the old open pollinated heirloom varieties of crops are the ones that have  
**[0:24:58-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:58):**  a better inherent potential there.  So from fertility to seed to genetics, we're working with a company called General Mills  here in the, in the U S which makes Cheerios and they've been doing market research and  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:14):**  the mothers of fathers who buy the Cheerios for the children would like to know that their  Cheerios are nutritious.  So General Mills wants to know what are the practices by which oats are grown more well  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:26):**  so that they can put on a label that their Cheerios are more nutritious than the competition.  So if you think about that whole supply chain and market dynamic, we expect significant  shifts when you pick the tomatoes on ripe like they do in this country and then ship  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:43):**  them and then, you know, gas them with ethylene and then they turn a reddish color.  When you pick a crop on ripe, it doesn't have in it the full suite of nutrients that it  could have.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:55):**  And so our thought is that the, you know, the mass production of agriculture is going  to be more difficult that, that farmers who are picking things, you know, more locally  in a growing in a more of a polyculture dynamic, I mean, are going to be out competing the  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:10):**  ones that are growing in the monocultures and picking raw and things like that.  It's an absolute massive ripple effect.  Obviously, if we start, if we start selecting for qualities and we start selecting for flavor,  
**[0:26:22-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:22):**  which sounds ridiculous that we didn't, but we did not because we had to produce as many  calories as possible, at least in Europe, the thought after the second world war, just  never hunger again.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:33):**  And we managed to do that, but it came at an enormous cost to everything else basically.  But I don't think we can underestimate how big of a shift this potentially could be.  I don't think you are underestimating it, but it's, it's good to remind the listeners  
**[0:26:49-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:49):**  to that.  There's other corollaries, you know, ecosystem services, the carbon markets, there's with  the data we're collecting and the hardware we're building, will have the ability to actually  
**[0:27:02-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:02):**  monetize that carbon sequestration.  We were talking to a known, which is I think is a European company, you know, after the  Paris climate accords, they made a commitment to be carbon neutral.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:14):**  And so they were looking at all of the aspects of their supply chain and understanding that  when cows are eating grass, they're actually carbon neutral or carbon negative.  They're functionally sequestering carbon.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:26):**  But when cows are eating grain, they're not.  They're causing increased carbon in the atmosphere.  So there's that whole vector, as far as I'm concerned, you know, the revolution in health  
**[0:27:35-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:35):**  care is going to be profound.  We know from our indigenous traditional wisdom, the role of medicinal plants or herbs and  things like that.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:46):**  You know, I think it was Hippocrates, the father of Western medicine, who said, let  food be thy medicine.  You know, we have correlated that the data exists to show these mineral deficiencies,  
**[0:27:56-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:56):**  these nutrient deficiencies correlate with these chronic illnesses, cancer, heart disease,  etc.  So we're going to be able to prescribe food to people to help systemically heal these  
**[0:28:09-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:09):**  ailments, which are now just managed by the sort of the major health care system.  So, yeah, I would expect a dramatic decrease in the need for pharmaceuticals in medical  devices, etc.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:22):**  The implications are quite exciting, actually.  Really exciting.  And again, I'm going to repeat myself.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:29):**  I'm very excited for this device.  The first version, I know it's the developer kit, which means it's going to have some tinkering  needed, etc.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:37):**  But I'm very excited what it means for me personally, but also in work, etc.  What kind of pushback do you get?  Because it, I mean, you're disrupting or in the process of disrupting some very powerful  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:51):**  industries that have been built over the last years to basically go against completely what  we're talking about here.  If you want to share, if you can share, have you had a lot of pushback?  
**[0:29:00-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:00):**  Have you had a strong, I mean, I remember interviewing such a top three party in from  India disrupting on the zero budget, natural farming in one of the regions there and getting  a lot of pushback from the fertilizer industry and the subsidized fertilized industry, obviously.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:17):**  But he was standing up to that.  What have you been getting through over the last 12 years?  And now that you're actually getting up to steam and not even getting support from Whole  
**[0:29:26-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:26):**  Foods, how has been the journey?  Well, I would say that we have not experienced much resistance.  There have been people such as yourself who said, boy, you should be worried about your  
**[0:29:38-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:38):**  safety.  But our strategy is to work with anybody who wants to work with us.  We're not opposed to Monsanto.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:46):**  You know, they've got an amazing global supply chain.  And if they want to understand the data that we're collecting and support farmers in producing  better crops, so be it.  
**[0:29:58-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:58):**  Let them.  We need to transition agriculture globally in short order.  So we're not against anybody.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:05):**  We're for life and for vitality.  And we're happy to work with anybody who wants to engage.  I think to a large degree, we're pretty small.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:15):**  We haven't made a lot of noise in social media, etc.  You're right, because everybody I talk to is like, does that exist?  I said, no, it's coming.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:23):**  A lot of people haven't seen or followed your work, I think, until the last six months or  so.  I haven't seen it popping up in many, many places.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:34):**  Yeah.  Which maybe has been good in this case.  I think, you know, speak softly and carry a large stick was, you know, I think Teddy  
**[0:30:42-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:42):**  Roosevelt, one of our presidents, was one of his mottos.  You know, let's not talk a lot about what we're doing.  Let's do it.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:49):**  And it is a bit of a paradigm shift.  It is a bit of a of an entirely different way of looking at things.  And when you've got the current model that's invested in a certain perspective and we're  
**[0:31:02-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:02):**  coming at things from a really different perspective, they can't even see us.  I don't think they can't even see what we're up to because we just don't register in their  field.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:11):**  You're not even on their competitive list or threat list.  You're off the radar.  It's a concept that I haven't even identified as a potential issue.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:21):**  So, you know, and I tell people publicly, like, you know, I'm happy to work with anybody  who wants to work with us in understanding what causes better quality.  And there's going to be a need for all number of businesses to support this process.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:37):**  There's going to be a bunch of people getting quite rich that are especially the early adopters  in it.  So, yeah, I think our strategy of a being willing to collaborate with anyone and be  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:48):**  you just being coming from such a different perspective has successfully, at least thus  far prevented any serious resistance.  That's very good to hear.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:58):**  And I want to be conscious of your time and end with with a final question, which usually  gets into two or three final questions.  If you could give advice to you and imagine there's a room for, like, let's say, a theater  
**[0:32:10-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:10):**  full of smart impact investors, at least we all consider ourselves smart listening to  this podcast and they have read about soil, the potential of carbon retro down.  They've followed some of the innovative farmers on the region X side, and they would like  
**[0:32:25-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:25):**  to put some of their money or maybe all of their money to work.  And without giving them investment advice, what would be your first step for them if  they want to get started in really understanding the agriculture space and being part of this?  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:40):**  I wouldn't say a small transition, but a gigantic transition that you're basically pushing.  You know, I'm biased.  Everybody is.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:49):**  And I have a I've got a I'm with that caveat.  I think that what we're doing is quite revolutionary and engaging with our organization of our  data collection with our, you know, our process is going to empower people regardless of whether  
**[0:33:07-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:07):**  at the supply chain in being leaders in the near future.  So we're doing the data collection necessary to really identify what the cost of dynamics  are that correlate with better quality.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:19):**  So anybody who's working with us to engage in data collection is going to know more than  their competitors.  They'll be more well established and in success.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:30):**  You know, if you're in the supply chain and you're in your purchasing crops and you're  processing them, etc., working with us to help understand the variation so that you  can choose which crops are better means that you're going to be well positioned when the  
**[0:33:43-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:43):**  when this whole thing hits.  So I don't know.  I mean, I don't I don't travel in those investor funder worlds very much.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:52):**  I don't I don't know where the plays are, as it were, in purchasing land and revitalizing  already existing plantations, etc.  I would welcome conversation with anybody who's interested.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:04):**  I'd be happy to come in and speak to a group of people in Milan or wherever who are who  are interested.  I think that there's a you know, we are a an NGO, a nonprofit educational organization.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:15):**  Everything we're doing is in the commons, which means it can't be controlled or owned.  So the engineering for the tool, the algorithm for the definition of quality, the app, the  data set, all that stuff is in the commons.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:31):**  And until it's properly built and fleshed out, what I'm talking about can't occur.  So we need actually those social impact investors.  They're a small amount of money from them could profoundly move this process forward.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:46):**  Yeah, I would even imagine it would just speed it up.  I mean, it's happening anyway.  Your trade, the train has left the station and is moving.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:54):**  And speed is important here.  At some point, it's going to start happening quite rapidly.  And the people engage the ground level are going to be positioned ahead of the competition.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:04):**  So yeah, I don't know much about a good enough answer.  But absolutely, no, definitely, I think engage the data collection, the engaging in organization,  depending on where you are, and what you can and want to do.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:18):**  And I think that the push and the asking questions around quality and around management and those  correlations is something that we don't do often enough anyway.  And we often think tomatoes are tomatoes or carrots are carrots.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:31):**  And to ask the final question, if you could change one thing in the agriculture and food  industry, if you could wave your magic wand and tomorrow morning, we will wake up and  that thing has changed, what would it be?  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:41):**  I think it's what I'm working on.  If I could ask for anything to change tomorrow, I'll wave my magic wand, it would be that  there's an understanding of variation in food quality, that food is not uniform.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:56):**  If we understood the variation and the implications of it, all the rest of these shifts would  follow would flow very naturally.  I want to thank you so much, Dan, I'm looking forward to follow you.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:07):**  I'm looking forward to use the tool and looking very much forward to checking in with you  as part of this transition.  Thank you so much for your time.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:16):**  Thank you very much.  It's been a pleasure talking to you.  I hope you enjoyed this interview about food quality, nutrient density and how the focus  
**[0:36:23-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:23):**  on that could change the whole food and agriculture sector.

**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:17):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:30):**  Why are we doing this course?  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been following the space since 2011  
**[0:37:40-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:40):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  How have we built our decision making framework?  
**[0:37:50-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:50):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?  
**[0:37:58-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:58):**  What should you read?  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  
**[0:38:02-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:02):**  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course?  You the soil builders and investors in the space, the soil builders, people working in  
**[0:38:10-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:10):**  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing,  platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line  designers, holistic management consultants, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:23):**  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies,  
**[0:38:37-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:37):**  et cetera.  Is this course free?  No.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:40):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:52):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:01):**  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:10):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:39:25-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:25):**  if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:36):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:44):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:52):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

**[0:00:09-0:00:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:09):**  slash course, or in the links below now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:24):**  Welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture and food.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:27):**  This is a special dedicated series on transition finance.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:31):**  Why are we recording this series?  
**[0:00:33-0:00:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:33):**  Many farmers are ready to speed up their regenerative transition.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:36):**  They've looked for learning, done the courses, read the key books, hosted the  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:40):**  gurus on their farms, explored farm size regenerative designs, and most importantly  
**[0:00:45-0:00:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:45):**  started their pilots and feedback loops.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:47):**  This is where transition finance is key.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:50):**  A local bank loan often isn't feasible because of the short duration, lack of  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:54):**  flexibility and the farmer's lack of collateral. Furthermore, there's a limit  
**[0:00:59-0:01:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:59):**  of how much equity a farmer is able or willing to give away.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:03):**  That is why my cohost aspiring to be regenerative farmer, Benedict  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:07):**  Boesel and I are embarking on a journey to find out what are the key principles  
**[0:01:12-0:01:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:12):**  of transition finance for regenerative farmers.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:15):**  We are interviewing leading practitioners in the regenerative  
**[0:01:18-0:01:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:18):**  agriculture and food finance space.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:20):**  They shared our insights, how they would finance the speed up of the regenerative  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:24):**  transition on Benedict's 1000 hectares, which is almost two and a half thousand  
**[0:01:29-0:01:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:29):**  acres farm in Germany, close to Berlin.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:32):**  This is an open process.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:33):**  We are sharing our lessons through the podcast episodes as we go along.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:37):**  We don't have the answers yet, just a lot of questions.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:39):**  So please share with us any examples of transition finance you've seen, other

**[0:01:57-0:01:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:57):**  So welcome to the podcast here, Benedict.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:59):**  I'm so excited to have you as my cohost on this journey.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:03):**  We're going to start with many interesting episodes and learn, I  
**[0:02:06-0:02:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:06):**  think a lot on transition finance.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:08):**  So welcome.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:09):**  Yeah, thank you very much.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:10):**  I'm glad to be here.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:12):**  I think, you know, we have so many things to discuss and I'm really  
**[0:02:16-0:02:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:16):**  interested to see where, where the journey leads us.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:18):**  And can you start with giving a small introduction?  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:21):**  I mean, I know you, I feel pretty well, but obviously the audience doesn't.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:25):**  If who you are and what made you take over a gigantic farmer, which, which  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:30):**  will completely explore in the next episodes in Germany, who's Benedict Beusel?  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:35):**  That's a good, if I would always know that, you know, I think that  
**[0:02:39-0:02:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:39):**  would help me already quite a bit.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:41):**  So basically I was born in Munich and lived there for the first couple of  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:45):**  years of my life, but we always went to the countryside on the weekends.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:49):**  And pretty much all I remember is actually playing on my own.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:55):**  You know, in the mud, in the forest, running around, being on my own,  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:00):**  being free in the nature, having two older sisters probably is part of that equation.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:06):**  You have to escape every now and then.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:08):**  Yeah, I think you kind of have to, especially in that age.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:10):**  And growing up, it was quite similar.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:12):**  We moved to the middle of Germany in the Rhineland, where  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:15):**  we also lived on the countryside.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:17):**  So for me, you know, in the, especially in the first couple of years, it was  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:22):**  always about being outside, hunting, fishing, you know, just being a boy in,  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:28):**  in the open, so to say, so my connection to nature is really, yeah, from a very  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:33):**  young age, I guess, and I was always fascinated by all different animals  
**[0:03:38-0:03:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:38):**  and species and, and, you know, all the complex systems and, and that real life  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:44):**  you can experience when you're outside.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:47):**  But you didn't, I mean, you didn't turn into a farmer immediately.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:52):**  You didn't study biology or you went to farming school, but you turned  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:56):**  into an investment banking career.  
**[0:03:58-0:03:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:58):**  That's quite a, quite a shift.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:00):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:01):**  I mean, it was actually quite the opposite.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:02):**  I mean, although having grown up like that and totally focused and  
**[0:04:06-0:04:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:06):**  on nature, when I was in the age of, let's say 18, 19, 20, the idea of  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:12):**  being a farmer was not that compelling to me, quite the opposite, you know,  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:17):**  I was looking at the whole banking industry and investment banking.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:21):**  And I remember when we like young kids starting to go out, you know, we were  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:24):**  always telling, telling the girls, yeah, we are an investment banker and we  
**[0:04:28-0:04:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:28):**  study on the LSE in London and so forth.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:30):**  And we, I think, you know, I kind of bought into that because obviously  
**[0:04:35-0:04:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:35):**  having that, that cool banking a lot of money idea and, and career, that was,  
**[0:04:41-0:04:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:41):**  yeah, something I thought was, you know, interesting in a way and, and could be a  
**[0:04:45-0:04:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:45):**  career, so that's really how I got into that.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:48):**  And I think at that time I wasn't, let's say I didn't reflect as much as, as you  
**[0:04:54-0:04:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:54):**  do when you get older naturally.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:56):**  So when I started learning, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:00):**  kind of, when I started in investment banking, we pretty much had the top phase  
**[0:05:05-0:05:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:05):**  2006, then we had the financial crisis 2007.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:08):**  And that's really, you know, when I started thinking about that whole process  
**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:13):**  and idea and the kind of the value and the meaning that you can actually  
**[0:05:17-0:05:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:17):**  achieve in that industry.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:18):**  And I mean, seeing how this, yeah, strong system of, I don't know that, that  
**[0:05:24-0:05:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:24):**  financial system suddenly basically collapses into it, collapses.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:31):**  And to see,  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:32):**  you basically, you started at the absolute height of the wave basically.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:37):**  And then the absolute depth came, like the strongest financial crisis since the  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:41):**  great depression basically followed immediately after.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:43):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:44):**  And I mean, as a 22 year old, you know, your view and those kinds of things are  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:48):**  obviously quite different and seeing that immediate reaction and then seeing your  
**[0:05:54-0:05:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:54):**  cool managing directors sitting in their offices and crying and you knew, okay,  
**[0:05:59-0:06:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:59):**  they have like two, three different children.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:03):**  They have huge investment, annuity costs that they have to cover.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:06):**  And suddenly, you know, they all don't have any jobs anymore.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:10):**  That really started a certain, at least emotional process with me.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:15):**  And I mean, that's, I think that was really the time where I kind of, you  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:18):**  know, after two, three years in investment banking, I started looking at, right,  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:23):**  like that's not your way.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:25):**  I mean, you know, I was like thinking about how can I really find, you know,  
**[0:06:30-0:06:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:30):**  what I'm supposed to do and having grown up in nature, having had that strong  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:34):**  connection all my life to let's say natural, the natural world, I was thinking,  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:39):**  okay, you know, this is like an area where we will have increasingly more problems  
**[0:06:43-0:06:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:43):**  and fundamental problems.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:45):**  And having seen how that crisis hit that the industry and what huge effect that  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:50):**  had on livelihoods from people all over the world, I thought, you know, as much  
**[0:06:55-0:07:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:55):**  as this is bad, you know, you have to turn your talents and your focus onto  
**[0:07:01-0:07:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:01):**  something that is actually good.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:02):**  So that brought me back to, you know, the, the, the question of, you know,  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:07):**  how can you contribute to, how can you bring your talent to an area where it  
**[0:07:11-0:07:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:11):**  really matters and naturally let's say nature and resources and those processes  
**[0:07:18-0:07:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:18):**  were my strongest focus, I guess.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:20):**  And that led you to start focusing more on environmental technologies and AgTech.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:27):**  How did that happen?  
**[0:07:28-0:07:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:28):**  How did you roll into that?  
**[0:07:29-0:07:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:29):**  What were exciting moments you remember?  
**[0:07:31-0:07:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:31):**  I mean, still you're involved in AgTech, but very soil focused, but let's say  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:34):**  before you took over the farm, what was your focus?  
**[0:07:38-0:07:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:38):**  Well, I mean, basically partly through my history, right?  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:41):**  So I had all that, let's say financial knowledge and experience from the  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:45):**  university, then, then working in mergers and acquisitions with the bank.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:51):**  After that, having done some restructuring, I knew that, you know, that  
**[0:07:55-0:07:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:55):**  is a kind of skill set and an instrument that could be quite beneficial.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:58):**  And I didn't want to move, you know, too far away from that.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:02):**  So I was looking for some situation where I can bring that in, but also, you know,  
**[0:08:06-0:08:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:06):**  move towards things where my passion lies.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:09):**  So that being, let's say resources and land use.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:13):**  And so I was between those two, having the financial side on one hand and, you  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:18):**  know, that new kind of way of, and vision of, of getting active in, in the natural  
**[0:08:23-0:08:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:23):**  world, so to say.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:24):**  And then I was, you know, screening basically on a worldwide scale, you  
**[0:08:28-0:08:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:28):**  know, how can you combine the two?  
**[0:08:30-0:08:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:30):**  How, what can you derive from that?  
**[0:08:32-0:08:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:32):**  How can you develop that somehow?  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:34):**  And obviously I looked, looked towards the US and that was a time where you had  
**[0:08:40-0:08:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:40):**  like the first couple of startups in the ag space and you had you had VCs like  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:47):**  Koltivian, Antara was already doing their first fund.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:52):**  Avrio was there also, but there was no ag fund.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:55):**  There was like the structure, the ag tech structure as we know today wasn't yet at  
**[0:09:00-0:09:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:00):**  all actually developed.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:01):**  But seeing that, like that idea of innovation, technological, digital  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:06):**  innovation in the agricultural space, I immediately thought, okay, wow.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:10):**  I mean, this is it.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:11):**  This is exactly what we need.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:12):**  We can only solve those huge problems through innovation and obviously  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:17):**  technology and, and digitalization obviously being a huge potential to that.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:23):**  So after I kind of, I guess, I mean, found that or understood that well, like  
**[0:09:30-0:09:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:30):**  understood that incredible potential, I brought, let's say a pitch, so to say, and  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:34):**  started connecting and contacting and meeting all the large German agriculture  
**[0:09:40-0:09:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:40):**  companies, potential investors.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:42):**  I looked for startups in the space.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:44):**  I reached out to universities.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:46):**  I started talking to different politicians and basically went around saying, guys,  
**[0:09:52-0:09:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:52):**  look, there's something happening here.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:54):**  There's innovation being developed.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:56):**  There's incredible potential and we, we need to be part of that.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:01):**  And I mean, going to a very traditional often also family-run company focused on  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:12):**  agriculture equipment and telling them about venture capital and investing into  
**[0:10:17-0:10:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:17):**  must be an interesting experience.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:19):**  Hack, check innovation.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:21):**  I mean, you know, I think those guys, they were always, you know, checking  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:24):**  underneath the table if I'm wearing shoes from made of wood or something, because  
**[0:10:29-0:10:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:29):**  that was just not on the cards.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:31):**  So there were never, they never heard of it.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:33):**  They never thought about that.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:35):**  Like even the pronunciation of startup is something that they took like three,  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:41):**  three appointments to, to get, to get going.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:45):**  So basically I think that was like the first time that, that we, you know, try to  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:50):**  develop those kinds of ideas, but you could immediately see that if you come as a  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:55):**  25, 26 year old, you want to raise a fund, invest in act tech startups after the  
**[0:11:00-0:11:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:00):**  biotech bubble, having no track record.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:03):**  I mean, that's just not a very good selling point, right?  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:05):**  I mean, I wouldn't give anyone money who would be in that position.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:09):**  So during that phase, I met someone who just raised or started a venture capital  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:14):**  corporate venture capital fund with Bill finger and building is also quite a  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:19):**  traditional company and different manufacturing and engineering processes.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:23):**  And because of their capability in, in water and garbage and renewable energy  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:31):**  technologies, they were already quite close to act tech let's say.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:35):**  So I started working with them looking at the market in a, I guess, in a similar  
**[0:11:40-0:11:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:40):**  way, but then they had some serious problems with regards to revenue forecasts  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:46):**  and the share price fell from 84 to 40 something, which I think was the first in  
**[0:11:52-0:11:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:52):**  German history to go down that badly.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:54):**  So obviously in those kinds of situations, venture capitalists is one of the things  
**[0:11:58-0:11:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:58):**  I think, exactly.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:59):**  I mean having to lay off 4,000 people and then telling someone that you'll invest  
**[0:12:05-0:12:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:05):**  into a startup.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:06):**  I think it's, it's also a difficult one, but that was a time for me that obviously  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:12):**  I was very involved in the whole market of agricultural startups in Germany.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:18):**  I spoke to, you know, many of the associations so that that have some  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:22):**  connection to farming.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:24):**  I did various talks and speeches at political institutes and political, like  
**[0:12:30-0:12:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:30):**  for the government.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:31):**  And what I realized that, you know, all of those technologies, all of the  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:37):**  problems, all of the, let's say underlying fundamentals, all of that, let's say  
**[0:12:43-0:12:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:43):**  complexity was just overwhelming.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:46):**  Right.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:46):**  So I really had that strong feeling that in order to develop the market, to  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:54):**  develop that idea, to produce technologies, to help startups also find solutions.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:00):**  You need people who are on the ground and you need people who are on the ground  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:04):**  and at the same time, open and willing and able to speak to all different interest  
**[0:13:10-0:13:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:10):**  groups.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:10):**  Right.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:11):**  I mean, you gotta be able to talk to an ecological farmer and a conventional  
**[0:13:15-0:13:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:15):**  farmer.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:16):**  You gotta be able to talk to people who are from the conservation side.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:19):**  You're gonna talk to large corporates like Bayer, for example.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:22):**  You gotta be able to talk to, or not only able, but willing to the politicians  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:27):**  because we can't solve those kinds of problems on our own.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:31):**  No one can.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:32):**  It always has to be a sort of interdisciplinary multi-functional group of  
**[0:13:37-0:13:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:37):**  actors and different actors coming together and saying, okay, let's do this.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:40):**  Let's solve this thing.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:41):**  And this thing for you also, if I understand and remember correctly, slowly,  
**[0:13:47-0:13:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:47):**  more and more and more, it started to click like this thing starts with soil.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:51):**  Like it starts and ends probably with soil.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:53):**  And was it a realization that you always had or was it something that over these  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:58):**  many talks you did, many conversations you had, many companies and startups you  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:02):**  looked at, and obviously many farms you visited and you spend, I'm imagining also  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:07):**  time on the farm of your parents, that soil moment, was there a soil moment?  
**[0:14:12-0:14:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:12):**  Was it a soil process?  
**[0:14:14-0:14:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:14):**  How did that grow?  
**[0:14:16-0:14:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:16):**  Yeah, I mean, definitely.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:17):**  I mean, that's a really good question.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:19):**  I guess there was two moments that kind of came together.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:22):**  There was a soil moment and there was a me, myself and I moment, I guess.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:26):**  But so after deciding...  
**[0:14:29-0:14:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:29):**  That was a soil moment.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:32):**  I think they're pretty much the same.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:34):**  But after starting, I took over the family farm in December 2016.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:39):**  And obviously coming from, let's say, the technology side, I was deeply interested  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:44):**  and fascinated by the whole potential of, let's say, technology and digitalization.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:49):**  And I thought innovation is key.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:51):**  So basically we're situated one hour east of Berlin.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:55):**  And what is very special about the place is the combination of incredibly low  
**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:59):**  precipitation and sandy soil.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:01):**  So as far as the precipitation is concerned, we have a 10-year average of around 450  
**[0:15:07-0:15:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:07):**  millimeters, whereas the last two years are around 200 to 300 millimeters per year.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:13):**  And then the soil at the same time is very sandy.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:16):**  So we have about between 1.1 and 1.5 percent organic matter.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:23):**  And that combination obviously is incredibly challenging for growing.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:28):**  For growing, yeah, I mean, for growing anything really.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:32):**  So yeah, I was thinking of specifying it, but I mean, it comes down to it that even  
**[0:15:40-0:15:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:40):**  a cactus needs some water.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:43):**  So basically I came from the technology side and thought innovation is key, technological  
**[0:15:49-0:15:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:49):**  innovation is key.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:51):**  And I was in contact with a couple of large agricultural equipment manufacturers saying  
**[0:15:56-0:16:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:56):**  like, let's have an example of a farm, an ecological farm, 1,000 hectares, where we  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:03):**  completely bring in all the technology that we have, all the digital processes.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:08):**  And it's one hour east of Berlin.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:10):**  We can have this place where people come together, potential buyers, customers, we'll do  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:16):**  events and just show what we actually can do already through technology.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:20):**  And through that process, I was sitting in my office looking outside and thinking, wow,  
**[0:16:29-0:16:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:29):**  it's not raining.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:29):**  And it continues to not rain.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:32):**  And I'm thinking, I'm reading about satellite and drones and this and here and forth.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:38):**  And I was like, wow, it's, I mean, like the reality of what I'll see when I look out  
**[0:16:43-0:16:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:43):**  of the window versus the theory of technology and instruments that I have on this contract  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:50):**  lying before me, it just has nothing to do with each other.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:54):**  The one thing outside, the thing that I'm considering in the office, there is a huge  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:59):**  discrepancy between the two when it comes to actual, let's say, applicability.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:05):**  A practicality.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:07):**  Practicality, yeah.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:08):**  I mean, exactly.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:09):**  So I stopped all of that and said, okay, this can't be the solution.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:13):**  And I thought, okay, so what is the by far most important asset and what is like the  
**[0:17:20-0:17:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:20):**  thing I have to put all my focus on?  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:22):**  And then that's exactly where the soil moment really started because I was like, okay, I  
**[0:17:28-0:17:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:28):**  mean, this is the key.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:30):**  I mean, soil for us builds soil organic matter, grow healthy soil, build soil fertility.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:36):**  And that being said, I mean, it's the soil biology, the physics, chemistry, I mean, so  
**[0:17:41-0:17:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:41):**  many things coming together.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:42):**  If I manage to build that, then that is the key for any challenge that there might come.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:49):**  And I mean, there is going to come very many, right?  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:52):**  And then all kinds of technologies and all kinds of ag tech, et cetera, will be extremely  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:57):**  useful if focused on building soil.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:01):**  Exactly.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:01):**  I mean, your soil moment.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:04):**  I mean, I think, you know, I don't want to sound like I don't think technology or digitalization  
**[0:18:09-0:18:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:09):**  is not going to help us.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:11):**  I think the potential is incredible, but it has to start from the soil.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:16):**  And what I see today in many, many, many cases, especially in agriculture, is that all the  
**[0:18:22-0:18:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:22):**  technology, all the digital products that we have, they always try to fight a certain  
**[0:18:29-0:18:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:29):**  problem, you know?  
**[0:18:30-0:18:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:30):**  But I think what we do in order to restore soil, in order to find agricultural land use  
**[0:18:37-0:18:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:37):**  models that actually grow the soil and enhance biodiversity, is not fight the outcomes or  
**[0:18:43-0:18:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:43):**  fight the problems, but maybe take a step back and think about the root causes of the  
**[0:18:49-0:18:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:49):**  problems and how we can actually change the root causes of the problems using nature,  
**[0:18:56-0:18:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:56):**  like in line with nature.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:57):**  And I think that was then, so to say, my moment, first realizing that, you know, the focus  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:05):**  has to be soil and then realizing that, you know, there's very different methods of doing  
**[0:19:11-0:19:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:11):**  agriculture, of thinking agriculture, of understanding agriculture, and that, you know, being inspired  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:17):**  by, you know, all the legends, obviously, that we all know and the books that we all  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:22):**  read, you know, starting from Alan Savory, Gabe Brown, Joe Zalatin, Ernst Gertz from  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:28):**  Brazil, Elaine Ingham, understanding what these guys, you know, have been doing for  
**[0:19:33-0:19:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:33):**  20, 30 years, which amazing ways of working with nature can help us in such a, yeah, I  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:41):**  mean, practical way, practical, amazing way.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:46):**  And not taking away from, I think, the potential of technology and the potential of the  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:52):**  machinery and the potential of software and et cetera, but the goals of the system have  
**[0:19:57-0:19:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:57):**  to be right in this case.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:59):**  Does it help farmers build soil at scale or does it enable farmers to do it faster or  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:04):**  does it enable someone like you to actually make other choices and other choices that  
**[0:20:09-0:20:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:09):**  you otherwise wouldn't have made?  
**[0:20:10-0:20:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:10):**  Is technology actually enabling you to do more?  
**[0:20:13-0:20:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:13):**  Exactly.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:14):**  I mean, I think today, as of now, we all like there's on the one side, you know, there's  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:20):**  people who are pushing, obviously, the developments of technology and let's say in a way  
**[0:20:26-0:20:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:26):**  that, you know, we see agriculture being done on a huge scale at the moment.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:33):**  And then on the other side, if there is sites, but then there's this area, this other group  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:39):**  that is, you know, focused on, let's say, nature-based solutions, multifunctional land  
**[0:20:43-0:20:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:43):**  use models, regenerative farming methods.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:46):**  And I think the combination of the two, which is already here and there on a small level,  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:52):**  it may be already happening, but I think once we bring those two groups together or those  
**[0:20:58-0:21:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:58):**  two lines of thought, I think this is when agriculture will be just fascinating and like  
**[0:21:06-0:21:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:06):**  incredibly, let's say, helping.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:09):**  Rewarding.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:10):**  Yeah, rewarding not only for the farmer, but also on a wider scale.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:16):**  Because if you ask me, you know, farming in my belief is by far the biggest instrument  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:22):**  that we have for many of the big problems that we see today.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:26):**  And I mean, we are talking about obviously CO2 sequestration, but we're also talking  
**[0:21:30-0:21:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:30):**  about health.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:31):**  I mean, that is one of the main parts, food as medicine.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:35):**  We're talking about inequality.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:36):**  We're talking about rural development.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:39):**  We're talking about education.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:40):**  I mean, and this is, I think, all in like not how do you say it?  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:45):**  Like this is all so strongly connected to the question of how we treat nature, how we  
**[0:21:51-0:21:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:51):**  use nature in a way that we can actually enhance it and make it better.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:57):**  And having that regenerative idea of land use, I think, yeah, it's something that we've  
**[0:22:03-0:22:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:03):**  already seen picking up so much in just the last couple of years.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:06):**  But I think it's going to be the main thing that we'll be talking about and not only in  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:11):**  the agricultural space, but I think it will actually leapfrog into other industries, which  
**[0:22:15-0:22:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:15):**  we can already see.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:16):**  And I think that is, that is incredible because, you know, that kind of concept coming out  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:21):**  of agriculture into other industries is, yeah, it's the way it should be, I guess.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:26):**  And I think it would be fascinating in this series because this is not the last time we'll  
**[0:22:32-0:22:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:32):**  be discussing.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:33):**  We're definitely going to focus on transition finance and obviously on the farm you took  
**[0:22:38-0:22:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:38):**  over and we're going to discuss that a bit later.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:40):**  But it touches upon so many other things.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:42):**  It touches on ecosystem services, on land ownership, on healthcare, on CO2, on what  
**[0:22:48-0:22:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:48):**  I mean there.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:49):**  And we're not going to shy away from that.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:51):**  So I'm very excited to really dive deep into this case and to really see where we can get  
**[0:22:58-0:22:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:58):**  with these models.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:59):**  I want to ask you a bit on the vision of the farm, but actually beyond the farm, because  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:03):**  you look, in general, you look beyond things.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:06):**  So you found it is a good imbecile.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:09):**  Can you explain a bit what that is and what your beyond farming vision entails?  
**[0:23:14-0:23:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:14):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:18):**  Basically, so the idea is because we are situated one hour east of Berlin, we obviously have  
**[0:23:25-0:23:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:25):**  quite a good connectivity for people that, you know, who are interested in those kind  
**[0:23:28-0:23:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:28):**  of, yeah, those kind of questions that we work on.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:31):**  And as I said, like, you know, I believe that the role of us as farmers is far beyond what  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:38):**  we today think of.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:39):**  You know, it's not only primary production.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:41):**  It is, and it can be, so many more fascinating things.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:45):**  So we have a, well, we framed a name, so to say, for that concept, which we call beyond  
**[0:23:51-0:23:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:51):**  farming, which really consists of three different parts.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:53):**  It's beyond sustainability, which is, of course, you know, the whole idea of saying,  
**[0:23:58-0:24:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:58):**  well, we don't want to just sustain, you know, we want to make it better.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:01):**  So we find, or we're looking for different forms of multifunctional land use models and  
**[0:24:08-0:24:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:08):**  bring them here on our challenging environment with a low precipitation and the sandy soil,  
**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:14):**  test them here, develop them here and see how they can be done in a way that they are  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:20):**  socially, ecologically and economically, let's say, beneficial.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:24):**  So that is one part, bring in those different, you know, lines of thought, I guess, from  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:29):**  regenerative agriculture, just to show, you know, what is possible and what not.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:33):**  Stay Forever On a large scale, like a large commercial  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:36):**  farm, I think that's often forgotten, because often this research is done either in universities  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:42):**  or other places that maybe don't have to focus on profitability or need to have it because,  
**[0:24:46-0:24:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:46):**  I mean, you have people to pay or you have people to pay.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:49):**  So there's this interesting, the farm as a platform or the land as a platform, but within  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:54):**  certain boundaries and certain, I mean, within the normal, let's say farming between brackets,  
**[0:24:59-0:25:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:59):**  normal farming system.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:02):**  I mean, that's a good point.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:03):**  I think, you know, in order to really be part of a paradigm that is being changed or to  
**[0:25:10-0:25:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:10):**  work into that, we can only make sure that it is applicable if we can scale it and if  
**[0:25:18-0:25:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:18):**  it is economically feasible, right?  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:20):**  So you can think about ecological and social benefits all you want.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:25):**  You need to find obviously a way that you can, as a farmer, earn good income from it  
**[0:25:30-0:25:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:30):**  and be sustainable from an economic point of view.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:33):**  So yeah, you're absolutely right.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:35):**  I mean, I think, you know, you have to bring it into the real context of being included  
**[0:25:41-0:25:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:41):**  or, yeah, like a big part of running the farm or being, you know, the farm business.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:47):**  So yeah, we will try to scale it up at the same time.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:51):**  Obviously there's, you know, so much knowledge to be captured, so much, let's say learnings  
**[0:25:58-0:26:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:58):**  to be made that, you know, a way for us is also to have people come in that either are  
**[0:26:05-0:26:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:05):**  skilled in that area already, or that let's say do a monitoring of it, be it NGOs, be  
**[0:26:12-0:26:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:12):**  it scientific groups, be it universities, to make sure that you can actually capture  
**[0:26:18-0:26:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:18):**  all the experience and the learnings that you see.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:21):**  And I mean, there's just so many, right?  
**[0:26:23-0:26:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:23):**  Yeah, sorry, I interrupted your beyond, the three points of beyond.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:27):**  We are still beyond sustainability.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:29):**  Yeah, I was going to come back to that, but thank you for that.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:32):**  No, so that's really, you know, that's the whole beyond sustainability part.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:36):**  Then on another note, we always say beyond food, because I think to bring in, let's say,  
**[0:26:42-0:26:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:42):**  the public, to bring in also politicians, to bring in many people who are often, you  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:48):**  know, talking about agriculture, let's say without really being aware of it in that instance,  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:53):**  or who talk about food, but don't think about agriculture.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:58):**  I think it's always important to find a good, like you have to speak their language, right?  
**[0:27:04-0:27:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:27:04):**  And coming too much, let's say from the agriculture angle, I think many are not yet there to understand  
**[0:27:11-0:27:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:27:11):**  that link between the two.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:27:12):**  So when we have guests, when we have visitors, when we are somewhere invited to talk somewhere,  
**[0:27:18-0:27:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:27:18):**  then we always come from, let's say, the food angle.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:27:21):**  And so, yeah, start the conversation on food and then move them into agriculture and try  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:27:27):**  to establish a feeling of why the two are so strongly interconnected, why soil health  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:27:33):**  has to do with plant health, human health, animal health.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:27:37):**  And I think it's a good way of starting a conversation and making people interested  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:27:42):**  about agriculture as such, because it is so strongly linked to emotions that you always  
**[0:27:47-0:27:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:27:47):**  have to find a way how they can open themselves up for something that...  
**[0:27:52-0:27:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:27:52):**  And start a discussion without polarizing it immediately.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:27:57):**  Because you lose people very quickly, which, or farmers in general, I mean, you lose people  
**[0:28:02-0:28:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:28:02):**  in general very quickly in these topics, especially on animal agriculture, especially on GMOs,  
**[0:28:08-0:28:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:28:08):**  especially on the big chemical companies.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:28:11):**  I mean, they're very rightfully so very touchy subjects.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:28:14):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:28:16):**  But food is something we all do.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:28:17):**  So yeah, it's a great way, a great segue into not starting to talk about soil immediately,  
**[0:28:24-0:28:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:28:24):**  which we usually do.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:28:25):**  But maybe it's not the best way, it's maybe to start to talk about food and how that came  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:28:29):**  from soil and the importance and the challenges and the opportunities.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:28:34):**  Yeah, exactly that.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:28:35):**  And I think when we have visitors or friends even here, one of the first things I always  
**[0:28:41-0:28:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:28:41):**  say is that I want them to be as honest and open as they possibly can.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:28:46):**  Because I tell them what I think and I tell them all my thoughts and ideas and feelings  
**[0:28:51-0:28:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:28:51):**  and whatnot.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:28:52):**  And if you have people visiting and them not being open, not asking questions, even if  
**[0:28:59-0:29:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:28:59):**  they think it might be a question that I don't want to hear, you will never touch those points,  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:29:05):**  those emotions that you actually need to touch upon if you want to get into a real discussion  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:29:09):**  and if you even might want to change something either in yourself or in the one you're talking  
**[0:29:14-0:29:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:29:14):**  to.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:29:14):**  So and I think food is something where you can find that level quite easily and then  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:29:20):**  move on to more complicated matters.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:29:25):**  So that's that part.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:29:26):**  And the third is basically what we call beyond business or beyond farm business really.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:29:32):**  Because being, let's say, an actor in the rural area and obviously having, let's say,  
**[0:29:39-0:29:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:29:39):**  the land that you're managing, the forest that you're managing, a lot of infrastructure  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:29:43):**  that goes with it, it's also there.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:29:46):**  It's not only primary production.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:29:48):**  Like we always understand ourselves also as a platform.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:29:51):**  So we work together with different startups that we assign certain fields from or we  
**[0:29:56-0:29:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:29:56):**  use a technology or use a product.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:29:58):**  So we try to bring in some value for them.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:30:02):**  At the same time, basically we lease land to a couple that are starting a market garden  
**[0:30:08-0:30:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:30:08):**  now.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:30:09):**  And then the land that we're leasing is for us actually not too good to cultivate.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:30:15):**  But for them, it's everything.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:30:17):**  So there's huge potential in that.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:30:19):**  And also there's some synergies.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:30:21):**  But it goes beyond that.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:30:22):**  It goes through basically educating people.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:30:25):**  Right, I mean, you could invite schools, you can invite other kids to say, look, just use  
**[0:30:32-0:30:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:30:32):**  the land for educating, use the land for all kinds of things.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:30:38):**  And it either goes beyond that and thinking about art.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:30:44):**  I think about different alternative models of music.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:30:49):**  Tell me about the gigantic root system that you had arrived on your farm as part of an  
**[0:30:56-0:30:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:30:56):**  art project.  
**[0:30:57-0:30:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:30:57):**  Yeah, I'll upload a photo of that.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:30:59):**  But basically, the area where we live here and where we farm is pretty much where the  
**[0:31:05-0:31:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:31:05):**  war ended.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:31:06):**  And so all the old oak trees, I mean, they have seen it all in a way.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:31:12):**  And next year in spring, we're celebrating the 75th anniversary of the ending of the  
**[0:31:17-0:31:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:31:17):**  war.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:31:18):**  And for the Internationalism, the Second World War we're talking about.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:31:22):**  Exactly, exactly.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:31:23):**  And we met this artist who's always been involved in history, German history, and also working  
**[0:31:30-0:31:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:31:30):**  with wood.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:31:31):**  And I said, man, what do you think about doing something together?  
**[0:31:34-0:31:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:31:34):**  I would love to do some sort of art project.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:31:36):**  And so we thought about that idea and went back and forth.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:31:40):**  And he said, don't you have an old root of an oak?  
**[0:31:44-0:31:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:31:44):**  And I was like, yeah, of course, we have plenty of those.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:31:49):**  So we found this huge oak root, which is, I don't know, five, six meters wide.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:31:54):**  And the tree is estimated to be around 200 years old.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:31:57):**  So basically, we took it out of the earth and carried it on the estate.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:32:05):**  And now it's there to dry.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:32:07):**  And next year, we're hoping to be able to put it in front of the or on the stairs of  
**[0:32:12-0:32:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:32:12):**  the Reichstag in Berlin.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:32:15):**  And the art curatorium of the Bundestag will discuss it and think about it in January,  
**[0:32:22-0:32:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:32:22):**  I think.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:32:22):**  So it's a parliament building of Berlin.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:32:26):**  That would be a nice symbol.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:32:27):**  Yeah, getting the roots.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:32:30):**  I've seen it.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:32:31):**  We'll put a picture.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:32:32):**  It's absolutely massive.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:32:34):**  And as it should be, it's a 200-plus year old tree.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:32:37):**  But still, it's very impressive to see the full or a big part of the root system about  
**[0:32:42-0:32:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:32:42):**  above ground and nothing is sort of.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:32:44):**  Yeah, I mean, it's incredible.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:32:45):**  And I think also, the root is something that many people often don't think about.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:32:51):**  And if you see that structure, it's just fascinating.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:32:54):**  I mean, it's really changing your look on things.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:32:57):**  And I think that is really something that we have to do on such a great scale.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:33:01):**  And that is, I think, why art ticks or has to have such a huge part of that whole discussion  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:33:06):**  we have today about changing the way we think about ecosystems, changing the way we think  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:33:11):**  about certain, let's say, economic processes, the setup of companies.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:33:16):**  I mean, that is all somehow involved with the horizon, at least of the.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:33:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:33:22):**  I think in terms of art and education, there's an enormous role to make things visible, like  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:33:27):**  the root system, to make region X visible, to make the damages of the current access  
**[0:33:32-0:33:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:33:32):**  invisible, to make the potential and the imagination.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:33:35):**  I think there's a huge role for that and something with the aesthetics of things and the taste  
**[0:33:42-0:33:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:33:42):**  of things, I think are very closely connected and make all of these discussions just a lot  
**[0:33:47-0:33:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:33:47):**  easier and a lot more fascinating, honestly.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:33:51):**  And I want to shift gears to, we're going to be extremely practical.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:33:55):**  We're going to unpack a bit the farm.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:33:58):**  And we already mentioned a few things, but I want to start with a question, actually.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:34:01):**  Why are you spending your time on a Friday afternoon to start what could be quite an  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:34:08):**  extensive journey to explore transition finance, not only for your farm, but actually the principles  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:34:13):**  of transition finance for many other farmers, let's say in Europe, but also actually outside  
**[0:34:18-0:34:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:34:18):**  Europe.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:34:19):**  What made you choose to take on next to all the farming, the root systems we discussed  
**[0:34:24-0:34:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:34:24):**  before to take on another project?  
**[0:34:27-0:34:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:34:27):**  That's a good question.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:34:28):**  And one that I've heard before, I guess.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:34:33):**  But when it comes to this podcast and the whole question of transitioning finance, I  
**[0:34:38-0:34:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:34:38):**  think there's so many young people, there's so many progressive thinkers, there's so many  
**[0:34:43-0:34:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:34:43):**  progressive farmers that are realising the situation that they're in.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:34:48):**  Obviously, there's some that are fighting to somehow stay alive, not only the farm,  
**[0:34:55-0:35:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:34:55):**  but the families, the work, the passion that they have, the love that they have for farming.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:35:00):**  And I think those are confronted with incredible problems and incredible, let's say, tasks  
**[0:35:06-0:35:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:35:06):**  ahead.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:35:06):**  So there's that whole group of people who are pretty much forced to find a new way.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:35:12):**  They are running out of options.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:35:14):**  And I think for them, transition financing in a way that still gives them enough flexibility,  
**[0:35:20-0:35:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:35:20):**  that gives them enough freedom, that gives them the time, also, let's say, from a psychological  
**[0:35:25-0:35:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:35:25):**  point, really, time to adapt, time to think about new ways, time to widen the horizon.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:35:32):**  I think that is a huge area for people who are passionate about agriculture.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:35:38):**  Exactly.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:35:39):**  And they really need it.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:35:40):**  So that's one part.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:35:41):**  And I think another part is of people saying and realising, wow, there is this whole new  
**[0:35:48-0:35:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:35:48):**  paradigm of agriculture, a new paradigm of coping with agricultural land, of cultivating  
**[0:35:53-0:35:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:35:53):**  land.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:35:54):**  There's a whole new meaningfulness of doing agriculture.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:35:58):**  And I want to get involved.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:36:00):**  I have me and my friends, I don't know, want to get involved.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:36:03):**  How do we do that?  
**[0:36:04-0:36:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:36:04):**  How can we get into that?  
**[0:36:05-0:36:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:36:05):**  How can we start?  
**[0:36:06-0:36:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:36:06):**  How can we get going?  
**[0:36:09-0:36:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:36:09):**  So for those people and those potential also new farmers, I think they are exactly at that  
**[0:36:16-0:36:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:36:16):**  point where they say, well, how can I actually start?  
**[0:36:19-0:36:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:36:19):**  Because not having the land, not being in that industry already, it's close to impossible  
**[0:36:24-0:36:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:36:24):**  to get going.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:36:25):**  And then there's a third group, which I guess I kind of consider myself part of, that is  
**[0:36:31-0:36:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:36:31):**  already farming, maybe also faced with a couple of potential difficulties, but also incredibly  
**[0:36:39-0:36:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:36:39):**  interested to develop further, to go new ways and at the same time seeing the incredible  
**[0:36:46-0:36:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:36:46):**  potential of it.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:36:47):**  But at the same time having a certain responsibility towards employees, towards family, towards  
**[0:36:55-0:36:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:36:55):**  maybe oneself, but also obviously towards the land.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:36:58):**  And I think that group is also saying, well, we've read all the books, we know, let's say,  
**[0:37:04-0:37:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:37:04):**  the characteristics, we see the potential, we want to do it.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:37:08):**  We believe we can hit a market.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:37:11):**  Yeah, we've done the pilots, we're ready to go.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:37:14):**  But obviously there's incredible risks involved.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:37:17):**  So I guess there's three different kinds of groups.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:37:20):**  There's probably many more, but for me, there's those large groups, which are all capable  
**[0:37:27-0:37:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:37:27):**  and willing to move into that.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:37:29):**  And just because there's so many people considering it, but all of which have to kind of go  
**[0:37:38-0:37:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:37:38):**  in unused waters, how do you say it?  
**[0:37:40-0:37:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:37:40):**  Untapped waters.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:37:42):**  In unknown waters.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:37:43):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:37:44):**  But still, I mean, it comes back to, it still doesn't mean you have to do this.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:37:48):**  I want to definitely thank you for your time and that we're going to explore.  
**[0:37:54-0:38:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:37:54):**  It's time to talk a bit about the farm and to see, we prepared a nice document with an  
**[0:38:01-0:38:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:38:01):**  overview, which we'll definitely link in the description below or wherever you're listening  
**[0:38:05-0:38:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:38:05):**  to this podcast.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:38:06):**  So you can read this back, but we can do a few highlights of the farm just to have an  
**[0:38:10-0:38:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:38:10):**  idea of size.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:38:11):**  What are we talking about?  
**[0:38:13-0:38:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:38:13):**  And I mean, I think you already guessed that it's not a small one.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:38:16):**  It's definitely bigger than your average few hectares.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:38:19):**  And so can you give a short overview of Gutenbozo in terms of the farm, but also the bigger  
**[0:38:26-0:38:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:38:26):**  platform as you described it?  
**[0:38:28-0:38:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:38:28):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:38:29):**  I mean, basically we are a family farm.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:38:32):**  So both of my parents live here and my two older sisters live here with their kids.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:38:36):**  Obviously I live here.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:38:38):**  And what we're doing as a whole group, I guess, is basically ecological agriculture on roughly  
**[0:38:44-0:38:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:38:44):**  1000 hectares, forestry on another 2000 hectares.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:38:48):**  There is a bed and breakfast with a couple of double rooms.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:38:51):**  We have a small bakery that we use or that we can use.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:38:56):**  There is an old English garden that we look after as well as, you know, the let's say  
**[0:39:01-0:39:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:39:01):**  different farm infrastructure that some of which you can use as an event room.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:39:06):**  And we pretty much run all of that with, let's say, a total of 20 employees.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:39:13):**  I guess as far as the agricultural land is concerned, as I said, our average ground points  
**[0:39:19-0:39:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:39:19):**  is around 35, which I think is a very German thing to say.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:39:24):**  I'm not sure if it's actually internationally known, but just to give you an idea.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:39:29):**  So it's a classification of soil quality, whereas 100 is as good as it gets and zero  
**[0:39:35-0:39:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:39:35):**  being the lowest.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:39:36):**  So you're definitely in the lower region.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:39:39):**  Yeah, I think for Brandenburg, like the county that we're in, it's actually not that bad  
**[0:39:44-0:39:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:39:44):**  as there's some that are worse.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:39:45):**  But to give you an example, if you stand on the beach and you have the sand on your feet,  
**[0:39:50-0:39:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:39:50):**  then that's probably 16, 17, 18 ground points and we are 35.  
**[0:39:55-0:40:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:39:55):**  So it should give you a good estimate of the quality.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:40:00):**  So our average plot size is around 40 hectares and most of the fields are nicely situated  
**[0:40:08-0:40:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:40:08):**  around the farm, I guess.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:40:10):**  So on a production note, basically our focus is grain production.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:40:14):**  Well, our focus as of now is grain production between 70, 75% is actually in grain production.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:40:22):**  Usually we have spelt barley, rye, wheat, all the classic ones.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:40:26):**  The rest is really legumes like sweet lupine and alfalfa.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:40:31):**  And I mean, this is basically the farm structure.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:40:35):**  When I started over, what we have done since then and started with and experimenting with  
**[0:40:41-0:40:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:40:41):**  is basically different forms of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:40:45):**  First of all, let's say a classical agroforestry system where we planted different species  
**[0:40:50-0:40:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:40:50):**  of popula and widow on a large field of roughly 30 hectares.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:40:56):**  And those are basically just thin lines, double rows, evenly dispersed over the field, really  
**[0:41:02-0:41:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:41:02):**  to see the effect on actually the grain production.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:41:05):**  So we know from the science that even if I reduced agricultural land by let's say 5 to  
**[0:41:11-0:41:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:41:11):**  10% by introducing those tree lines, I could probably have the same yield on the remaining  
**[0:41:19-0:41:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:41:19):**  the same or even higher yield on the remaining agriculture field just because of the introduction  
**[0:41:26-0:41:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:41:26):**  of the ecosystem functions of the biomass of the tree lines.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:41:29):**  And I think that is so applicable to the place that we are.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:41:32):**  I mean, we have this incredible drought time between really early spring, early summer.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:41:38):**  Also afterwards, the ground temperature sometimes reaches, I guess, 70, 80%.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:41:43):**  You have this amazing radiation, heat, dryness.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:41:47):**  So any tree, anything that can block that basically will help changing the local, the  
**[0:41:54-0:41:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:41:54):**  microclimate.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:41:55):**  Exactly.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:41:55):**  So I think that changing microclimate between the three lines, I think is going to have  
**[0:41:59-0:42:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:41:59):**  a huge impact also on an erosion.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:03):**  Wind erosion is going to be a big thing.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:06):**  And then, I mean, if there is water, if it rains, obviously the soil is in a way that  
**[0:42:11-0:42:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:11):**  it actually can't take up any of it.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:13):**  Right.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:13):**  So I think that agroforestry, that let's say simple agroforestry system is going to be  
**[0:42:18-0:42:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:18):**  very interested.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:18):**  We have a couple of scientific facilities that are also, you know, monetizing the soil  
**[0:42:26-0:42:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:26):**  development, let's say, or monitoring the soil development, which I think is going to  
**[0:42:30-0:42:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:30):**  be great.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:31):**  That's the next step.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:32):**  I was going to say, damn.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:33):**  Wow, you're advanced.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:34):**  Wow.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:35):**  It's automatic.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:35):**  It's transferring the Bitcoin straight to you.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:39):**  We'll see.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:39):**  We'll see how that goes.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:40):**  Depending on the outcome, maybe you'll think about it, but yeah.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:45):**  Then we have a project together with Ernst Gertsch, which is from Switzerland, and he  
**[0:42:51-0:42:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:51):**  developed in Switzerland as well as in Brazil, basically a style of agroforestry, a biodynamic  
**[0:42:58-0:42:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:58):**  agroforestry, I would call it.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:59):**  It's called syntropic agriculture.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:43:02):**  Which is extremely advanced, right?  
**[0:43:04-0:43:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:43:04):**  And I think you're one of the first, or maybe even the first to do, first of all, at scale,  
**[0:43:09-0:43:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:43:09):**  this is three and a half hectares in Germany.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:43:11):**  I don't think I've seen anybody getting, first of all, Ernst Gertsch to Germany and then  
**[0:43:15-0:43:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:43:15):**  actually implementing one of these projects.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:43:18):**  Or am I wrong?  
**[0:43:20-0:43:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:43:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:43:20):**  I mean, it took some motivation, I guess, to bring him over.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:43:25):**  But I mean, his way of doing agriculture is quite popular in Brazil, in Argentina, and  
**[0:43:32-0:43:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:43:32):**  also on a large scale.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:43:33):**  So it is being proven in a way there already.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:43:37):**  And he started a couple of projects in Europe, one in Spain, one in Switzerland, one in Portugal,  
**[0:43:42-0:43:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:43:42):**  and a few others.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:43:44):**  And then we are lucky to have him in Germany as well.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:43:47):**  And well, the idea is really, and I think actually this is something so fascinating  
**[0:43:53-0:43:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:43:53):**  about all those different lines of thought of regenerative ag.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:43:58):**  It's always the same characteristics, really.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:44:00):**  I mean, it's always about keeping the soil covered, having a diverse crop rotation, having  
**[0:44:05-0:44:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:44:05):**  a large diversity of plants and animals, all the large ones, less soil disturbance, obviously.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:44:13):**  And it's the same with the syntropic one.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:44:15):**  And whenever I have visitors, then everyone is always like, yeah, but how can syntropic  
**[0:44:19-0:44:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:44:19):**  agriculture work in your environment?  
**[0:44:22-0:44:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:44:22):**  And I always say, well, we're not going to plant any coca trees or bananas.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:44:29):**  Exactly.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:44:30):**  But the principles are similar, right?  
**[0:44:32-0:44:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:44:32):**  And obviously we're testing and developing.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:44:34):**  We'll never be ready, but as from what we already can see today, I mean, there's just  
**[0:44:39-0:44:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:44:39):**  incredible potential to it.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:44:41):**  So what we're doing there is basically having an agroforestry system where we're not only  
**[0:44:46-0:44:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:44:46):**  looking obviously at popular, but we're looking at a combination of pioneering species with  
**[0:44:51-0:44:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:44:51):**  nut trees, a pioneering species with different fruit trees, fruit bushes, having different  
**[0:44:56-0:45:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:44:56):**  layers within one tree line and obviously different potential usages at different times,  
**[0:45:04-0:45:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:45:04):**  all having some sort of synergetic effect with each other and helping each other on  
**[0:45:09-0:45:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:45:09):**  different levels, be it through fungi, be it through shadows, be it through different  
**[0:45:13-0:45:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:45:13):**  root structures.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:45:15):**  So very versatile, very complex.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:45:17):**  And those systems are always designed in a way that part of the system is actually for  
**[0:45:21-0:45:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:45:21):**  the system itself.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:45:22):**  Basically the pioneer species will be pruned each year and the biomass that is being cut  
**[0:45:29-0:45:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:45:29):**  is then brought back onto the soil to stimulate, let's say, nutrients and food for the soil,  
**[0:45:36-0:45:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:45:36):**  microbiology and biology, obviously.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:45:40):**  And another part of the system is for producing nutritious food for people or actually animals  
**[0:45:46-0:45:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:45:46):**  also.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:45:46):**  So that is a system that we're trying and we've just planted I think 1,500 trees and  
**[0:45:53-0:45:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:45:53):**  bushes a couple of weeks ago, actually two weeks ago.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:45:57):**  So then our next project is the animals.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:46:00):**  Yeah, you were mentioning it already.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:46:02):**  Yeah, holistic grazing following Alan Savory, at least we're trying to, but it's really  
**[0:46:09-0:46:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:46:09):**  tough when it comes to having your mobile fence and having no rain for eight weeks.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:46:15):**  Then I haven't yet found a mobile fence that is hard enough or good enough to get into  
**[0:46:20-0:46:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:46:20):**  the ground.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:46:20):**  So much to be learned.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:46:23):**  But anyway, so maybe some people that are listening that are operating in more desert  
**[0:46:28-0:46:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:46:28):**  like circumstances have some tips for you.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:46:32):**  Yeah, basically I know there is like we need that rolling kind of fence that is like on  
**[0:46:37-0:46:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:46:37):**  I think five different poles and it rolls above the ground.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:46:41):**  I think that is a good way of doing it because you know our soil gets as hard as stone pretty  
**[0:46:47-0:46:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:46:47):**  much.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:46:48):**  If it doesn't rain for a while then there's just nothing you can put in there as a fence.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:46:53):**  But basically we have pretty much 20 calves.  
**[0:46:56-0:47:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:46:56):**  We'll have our first calves, had our first calves a couple of weeks ago.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:47:02):**  We'll have another 20 hyphas coming beginning of next year and another or part of our soil  
**[0:47:11-0:47:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:47:11):**  of our herd is going to have their cows also beginning next year.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:47:17):**  So we'll have around 60 heads starting the year and obviously practicing let's say you  
**[0:47:24-0:47:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:47:24):**  know rotational grazing and you know learning and observing as much as we can.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:47:29):**  One thing that we'll be starting to build within the next couple of weeks is our first  
**[0:47:34-0:47:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:47:34):**  mobile laying hen house as well as three little groups for the broilers.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:47:42):**  And the broilers will go into the syntropic testing grounds and the laying hens will then  
**[0:47:49-0:47:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:47:49):**  start to follow the cows in spring next year.  
**[0:47:53-0:47:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:47:53):**  And as you have so much grain you for sure also have some leftovers to feed them.  
**[0:47:58-0:47:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:47:58):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:47:59):**  I mean I think that is really one of the concepts that are easy to grasp.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:48:05):**  Basically you know use potential side-offs or things that you don't actually have usage  
**[0:48:11-0:48:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:48:11):**  for and see how you can somehow create some value from it.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:48:15):**  And as far as the grain is concerned I mean you know we have a cleaning facility for the  
**[0:48:19-0:48:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:48:19):**  grain so there's so much left over, so much potential garbage grain so to say.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:48:26):**  That is a great feed potentially.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:48:29):**  So we definitely use that.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:48:31):**  And the same way with potential compost components.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:48:36):**  We've started doing some different experiments with composting.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:48:41):**  So the classical vermicompost we've built four bioreactors following the Johnson-Sue  
**[0:48:47-0:48:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:48:47):**  model which we're really fascinated and also excited about to get you know getting  
**[0:48:55-0:48:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:48:55):**  that microbiology and the bacteria and the fungi going.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:48:58):**  So yeah it's a good project.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:49:01):**  I'll show I could provide some photos of that later on as well.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:49:05):**  They look very impressive I have to say.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:49:08):**  And you were mentioning that they actually get to some good temperatures but obviously  
**[0:49:12-0:49:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:49:12):**  we have to see over the next months how that develops.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:49:17):**  And when you think I want to spend a few minutes I want to be conscious of our time as well  
**[0:49:23-0:49:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:49:23):**  to spend a few minutes on when I say transition finance or when somebody mentions that in  
**[0:49:30-0:49:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:49:30):**  this context of this farm what does that trigger to you?  
**[0:49:33-0:49:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:49:33):**  What would you be able to do if you had appropriate transition finance and what would that mean  
**[0:49:39-0:49:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:49:39):**  in terms of this project that you just mentioned?  
**[0:49:42-0:49:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:49:42):**  And the pilots, some are maybe out of pilot phase, some are definitely in the pilot phase.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:49:47):**  What would you do with transition finance?  
**[0:49:49-0:49:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:49:49):**  That's a good question.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:49:51):**  Which we're going to explore in the next episode.  
**[0:49:53-0:49:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:49:53):**  So like the first few thoughts, what comes to mind now on this Friday afternoon?  
**[0:49:59-0:50:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:49:59):**  Exactly.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:50:01):**  I mean what comes to mind?  
**[0:50:03-0:50:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:50:03):**  First of all I think there is a couple of learnings that one needs to have done or needs  
**[0:50:10-0:50:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:50:10):**  to be in in order to know the way and the how which is applicable to the one in question.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:50:19):**  I think that's something that we are really figuring out right now and we already have  
**[0:50:24-0:50:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:50:24):**  some or quite a good idea of what I understand or what I would like to understand I guess  
**[0:50:33-0:50:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:50:33):**  when I hear transitioning finance it's basically a partner, a way of having a partner that  
**[0:50:40-0:50:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:50:40):**  in the best case understands the situation that I am in, that we are in, understands  
**[0:50:47-0:50:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:50:47):**  why we want to change, how we can change, why it is profitable to go that way and by  
**[0:50:55-0:51:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:50:55):**  saying profitable I don't only talk about monetization for me as a farmer or as us as  
**[0:51:02-0:51:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:51:02):**  a farm operation but obviously talk about the ecological side effect, the social potential  
**[0:51:09-0:51:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:51:09):**  and let's say the industry as a whole.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:51:13):**  On top of that having that idea of changing fundamental habits and changing the horizon  
**[0:51:25-0:51:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:51:25):**  and that in a way that gives you the leeway to actually rethink certain ways and processes  
**[0:51:34-0:51:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:51:34):**  and also have the time.  
**[0:51:38-0:51:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:51:38):**  I think I always call it…  
**[0:51:40-0:51:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:51:40):**  Time is an interesting one.  
**[0:51:41-0:51:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:51:41):**  Yeah, at the time.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:51:43):**  To be honest with you I always call it emotional freedom, that's what it is for me because  
**[0:51:49-0:51:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:51:49):**  we are faced with so many pressures and fears and risks.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:51:56):**  It's sometimes as beautiful and inspiring and great it is to be a farmer and to be outside  
**[0:52:03-0:52:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:52:03):**  and to do all of those things.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:52:07):**  It is a huge pressure that you have, it's a huge responsibility you have, it's not  
**[0:52:12-0:52:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:52:12):**  only the family and the family of the people who are working on the farm, it goes beyond  
**[0:52:19-0:52:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:52:19):**  that and I think in order to be able to change and to facilitate change you can't work  
**[0:52:26-0:52:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:52:26):**  freely if you have that pressure on you all the time and if you have those fears about  
**[0:52:32-0:52:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:52:32):**  the future all the time.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:52:33):**  So for me that idea of transitioning is also to have the feeling that you're not alone  
**[0:52:39-0:52:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:52:39):**  in this game and there's someone or an institute that is being part of it, that understands  
**[0:52:45-0:52:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:52:45):**  it, that goes through the highs as well as the lows and that you can rely on and obviously  
**[0:52:52-0:52:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:52:52):**  that goes both ways.  
**[0:52:55-0:53:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:52:55):**  And what in this case, you mentioned a number of pilot projects and obviously we'll dive  
**[0:53:05-0:53:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:53:05):**  deeper into the different ones and we'll dive deeper with guests into all the aspects  
**[0:53:09-0:53:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:53:09):**  of transition finance and obviously that's going to change over years as new things,  
**[0:53:14-0:53:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:53:14):**  a lot of lessons will be learned.  
**[0:53:16-0:53:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:53:16):**  Would it now be mostly is it safe to say that most of let's say if you've got transition  
**[0:53:21-0:53:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:53:21):**  finance, whatever shape or form that will take, now you would use it to speed up the  
**[0:53:27-0:53:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:53:27):**  implementation of some of these because some are 30 hectares, some are three and a half,  
**[0:53:32-0:53:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:53:32):**  but it's very expensive to do cover crops everywhere and it's very expensive to plant  
**[0:53:37-0:53:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:53:37):**  trees and very risky because not everything has been figured out yet.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:53:42):**  So you are looking for basically fuel to speed up the process and at the same time by time,  
**[0:53:49-0:53:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:53:49):**  it's this constant tension between speeding up and actually going slower and take a step  
**[0:53:53-0:53:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:53:53):**  back and actually have that emotional freedom which you mentioned.  
**[0:53:57-0:53:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:53:57):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:53:58-0:54:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:53:58):**  I mean that is completely right.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:54:01):**  I think when it comes to the level on the ground level of the different projects, I  
**[0:54:08-0:54:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:54:08):**  would have a pretty good idea of where to start if I was going to speed up or if I wanted  
**[0:54:12-0:54:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:54:12):**  to speed up.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:54:14):**  And what kind of sizes are we thinking of?  
**[0:54:16-0:54:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:54:16):**  Is it are we discussing 5,000, 500,000, 5 million or 50 million?  
**[0:54:22-0:54:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:54:22):**  What is the dimension without going into euro details, what are dimensions people should  
**[0:54:28-0:54:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:54:28):**  think about if they're going to also help us and reach out with feedback, with ideas,  
**[0:54:32-0:54:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:54:32):**  with people to interview, et cetera, that we are talking about at this large scale farm  
**[0:54:37-0:54:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:54:37):**  because it is a thousand hectares plus the forestry part where we talk about the farming  
**[0:54:40-0:54:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:54:40):**  part now.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:54:41):**  What are the dimensions you are at least thinking of and calculating with, let's say in your  
**[0:54:45-0:54:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:54:45):**  models?  
**[0:54:46-0:54:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:54:46):**  Yeah, basically.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:54:47):**  I mean, obviously there's different ways of, let's say the speediness of the process that  
**[0:54:53-0:54:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:54:53):**  you want to take and also the scale that you want to consider.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:54:58):**  But from what I've experienced so far from the things that I've seen and I think I have  
**[0:55:05-0:55:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:55:05):**  a good idea also of let's say the financial applications, I would probably have a discussion  
**[0:55:12-0:55:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:55:12):**  of, let's say something between 500,000 and a million to really take a couple of bigger  
**[0:55:18-0:55:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:55:18):**  steps and I think that's, yeah, I mean, you know, that's already quite a lot.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:55:26):**  It's a lot and it's nothing if we talk about some movements in the space or movements in  
**[0:55:32-0:55:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:55:32):**  the finance space, but yeah, it's an enormous amount of money if you look at your general  
**[0:55:37-0:55:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:55:37):**  bank account.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:55:38):**  Exactly.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:55:39):**  And I mean, this is really where suddenly that whole discussion of transition financing  
**[0:55:47-0:55:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:55:47):**  on an emotional level makes you feel how important it is.  
**[0:55:51-0:55:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:55:51):**  Because if you think that in a usual bank loan, so to say, having that figure just in  
**[0:55:58-0:56:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:55:58):**  front of you, that is a lot of money on the farm level, let's say.  
**[0:56:01-0:56:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:56:01):**  And I think that it makes it quite tangible why that whole idea of transition financing  
**[0:56:07-0:56:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:56:07):**  is so important because you have to think about a way that you can work with that money  
**[0:56:15-0:56:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:56:15):**  and actually develop and achieve what you're setting out to or what you're trying to in  
**[0:56:21-0:56:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:56:21):**  a way that, yeah, as we've already said, give you the freedom and the time to actually work  
**[0:56:27-0:56:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:56:27):**  with it and not having to worry and not having to think about annuities and the bank that  
**[0:56:36-0:56:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:56:36):**  is not going to be on your side of the table.  
**[0:56:39-0:56:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:56:39):**  Right.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:56:40):**  I think that's exactly, I think that's a critical part really.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:56:43):**  We would love it to be.  
**[0:56:44-0:56:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:56:44):**  I mean, if your local bank, talking to all the farmers that hopefully listen, is that  
**[0:56:50-0:56:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:56:50):**  partner and has the principles that we're going to explore in this series and is honoring  
**[0:56:55-0:56:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:56:55):**  that, then obviously it will be ideal and you can find that money somewhere.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:56:59):**  But what we've seen in many of these discussions, like this finance to transition farms often  
**[0:57:05-0:57:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:57:05):**  isn't there or is very badly or unfairly, let's say, structured.  
**[0:57:10-0:57:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:57:10):**  So we're going to explore those questions and they're going to be uncomfortable questions  
**[0:57:14-0:57:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:57:14):**  and they're going to be difficult ones in the next episodes with guests actually on  
**[0:57:18-0:57:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:57:18):**  the show.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:57:19):**  So we're going to have people that are deep into the space and I'm going to ask them to  
**[0:57:22-0:57:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:57:22):**  see and look at this case and say, okay, how would you finance this if you were in those  
**[0:57:27-0:57:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:57:27):**  shoes?  
**[0:57:28-0:57:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:57:28):**  So I'm extremely excited to explore that further over the next months and dive deeper into  
**[0:57:33-0:57:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:57:33):**  the transition finance piece and everything that unlocks as well.  
**[0:57:37-0:57:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:57:37):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:57:38-0:57:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:57:38):**  I mean, I guess I'm kind of looking forward, it's a combination of looking forward and  
**[0:57:44-0:57:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:57:44):**  being scared of the kind of things that we'll have to talk about, the kind of connections  
**[0:57:50-0:57:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:57:50):**  that we'll make, I think are going to be incredibly interesting.  
**[0:57:54-0:58:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:57:54):**  And it'd be great to hear also from a potential audience that is interested in the space,  
**[0:58:00-0:58:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:58:00):**  what kind of questions they have.  
**[0:58:02-0:58:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:58:02):**  I know what kind of problems they see or fears that they have, because I think as far as  
**[0:58:08-0:58:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:58:08):**  farming is concerned, it's so heterogeneous and the things and the questions that I ask,  
**[0:58:13-0:58:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:58:13):**  the problems that I have, the considerations that I think about are obviously all my problems.

**[0:59:53-0:59:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:59:53):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[1:00:55-1:00:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:00:55):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.

**[1:01:15-1:01:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:01:15):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[1:01:21-1:01:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:01:21):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[1:01:23-1:01:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:01:23):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[1:01:28-1:01:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:01:28):**  is so risky.  
**[1:01:29-1:01:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:01:29):**  How to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to invest  
**[1:01:34-1:01:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:01:34):**  in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find if  
**[1:01:38-1:01:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:01:38):**  you're a soil builder.  
**[1:01:40-1:01:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:01:40):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[1:01:45-1:01:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:01:45):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[1:01:49-1:01:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:01:49):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[1:01:53-1:01:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:01:53):**  So what is it not?  
**[1:01:55-1:01:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:01:55):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:01:56-1:01:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:01:56):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:01:59-1:02:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:01:59):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:02:03-1:02:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:02:03):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:02:05-1:02:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:02:05):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

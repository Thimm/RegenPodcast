### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2019-12-21)  
### Author(s): Koen van Seijen  

**[0:00:00-0:00:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative  food and agriculture, follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com  slash course, or in the links below now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:24):**  Welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture and food.  This is a special dedicated series on transition finance.  Why are we recording this series?  
**[0:00:33-0:00:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:33):**  Many farmers are ready to speed up their regenerative transition.  They've looked for learning, done the courses, read the key books, hosted the  gurus on their farms, explored farm size regenerative designs, and most importantly  
**[0:00:45-0:00:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:45):**  started their pilots and feedback loops.  This is where transition finance is key.  A local bank loan often isn't feasible because of the short duration, lack of  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:54):**  flexibility and the farmer's lack of collateral. Furthermore, there's a limit  of how much equity a farmer is able or willing to give away.  That is why my cohost aspiring to be regenerative farmer, Benedict  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:07):**  Boesel and I are embarking on a journey to find out what are the key principles  of transition finance for regenerative farmers.  We are interviewing leading practitioners in the regenerative  
**[0:01:18-0:01:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:18):**  agriculture and food finance space.  They shared our insights, how they would finance the speed up of the regenerative  transition on Benedict's 1000 hectares, which is almost two and a half thousand  
**[0:01:29-0:01:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:29):**  acres farm in Germany, close to Berlin.  This is an open process.  We are sharing our lessons through the podcast episodes as we go along.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:37):**  We don't have the answers yet, just a lot of questions.  So please share with us any examples of transition finance you've seen, other  inspiration, people to interview, et cetera, get in touch via the contact page  
**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:48):**  on the website, investinginregenerativeagriculture.com.  That is investinginregenerativeagriculture.com.  So welcome to the podcast here, Benedict.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:59):**  I'm so excited to have you as my cohost on this journey.  We're going to start with many interesting episodes and learn, I  think a lot on transition finance.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:08):**  So welcome.  Yeah, thank you very much.  I'm glad to be here.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:12):**  I think, you know, we have so many things to discuss and I'm really  interested to see where, where the journey leads us.  And can you start with giving a small introduction?  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:21):**  I mean, I know you, I feel pretty well, but obviously the audience doesn't.  If who you are and what made you take over a gigantic farmer, which, which  will completely explore in the next episodes in Germany, who's Benedict Beusel?  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:35):**  That's a good, if I would always know that, you know, I think that  would help me already quite a bit.  So basically I was born in Munich and lived there for the first couple of  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:45):**  years of my life, but we always went to the countryside on the weekends.  And pretty much all I remember is actually playing on my own.  You know, in the mud, in the forest, running around, being on my own,  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:00):**  being free in the nature, having two older sisters probably is part of that equation.  You have to escape every now and then.  Yeah, I think you kind of have to, especially in that age.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:10):**  And growing up, it was quite similar.  We moved to the middle of Germany in the Rhineland, where  we also lived on the countryside.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:17):**  So for me, you know, in the, especially in the first couple of years, it was  always about being outside, hunting, fishing, you know, just being a boy in,  in the open, so to say, so my connection to nature is really, yeah, from a very  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:33):**  young age, I guess, and I was always fascinated by all different animals  and species and, and, you know, all the complex systems and, and that real life  you can experience when you're outside.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:47):**  But you didn't, I mean, you didn't turn into a farmer immediately.  You didn't study biology or you went to farming school, but you turned  into an investment banking career.  
**[0:03:58-0:03:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:58):**  That's quite a, quite a shift.  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, it was actually quite the opposite.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:02):**  I mean, although having grown up like that and totally focused and  on nature, when I was in the age of, let's say 18, 19, 20, the idea of  being a farmer was not that compelling to me, quite the opposite, you know,  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:17):**  I was looking at the whole banking industry and investment banking.  And I remember when we like young kids starting to go out, you know, we were  always telling, telling the girls, yeah, we are an investment banker and we  
**[0:04:28-0:04:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:28):**  study on the LSE in London and so forth.  And we, I think, you know, I kind of bought into that because obviously  having that, that cool banking a lot of money idea and, and career, that was,  
**[0:04:41-0:04:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:41):**  yeah, something I thought was, you know, interesting in a way and, and could be a  career, so that's really how I got into that.  And I think at that time I wasn't, let's say I didn't reflect as much as, as you  
**[0:04:54-0:04:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:54):**  do when you get older naturally.  So when I started learning, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was  kind of, when I started in investment banking, we pretty much had the top phase  
**[0:05:05-0:05:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:05):**  2006, then we had the financial crisis 2007.  And that's really, you know, when I started thinking about that whole process  and idea and the kind of the value and the meaning that you can actually  
**[0:05:17-0:05:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:17):**  achieve in that industry.  And I mean, seeing how this, yeah, strong system of, I don't know that, that  financial system suddenly basically collapses into it, collapses.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:31):**  And to see,  you basically, you started at the absolute height of the wave basically.  And then the absolute depth came, like the strongest financial crisis since the  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:41):**  great depression basically followed immediately after.  Yeah, exactly.  And I mean, as a 22 year old, you know, your view and those kinds of things are  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:48):**  obviously quite different and seeing that immediate reaction and then seeing your  cool managing directors sitting in their offices and crying and you knew, okay,  they have like two, three different children.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:03):**  They have huge investment, annuity costs that they have to cover.  And suddenly, you know, they all don't have any jobs anymore.  That really started a certain, at least emotional process with me.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:15):**  And I mean, that's, I think that was really the time where I kind of, you  know, after two, three years in investment banking, I started looking at, right,  like that's not your way.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:25):**  I mean, you know, I was like thinking about how can I really find, you know,  what I'm supposed to do and having grown up in nature, having had that strong  connection all my life to let's say natural, the natural world, I was thinking,  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:39):**  okay, you know, this is like an area where we will have increasingly more problems  and fundamental problems.  And having seen how that crisis hit that the industry and what huge effect that  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:50):**  had on livelihoods from people all over the world, I thought, you know, as much  as this is bad, you know, you have to turn your talents and your focus onto  something that is actually good.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:02):**  So that brought me back to, you know, the, the, the question of, you know,  how can you contribute to, how can you bring your talent to an area where it  really matters and naturally let's say nature and resources and those processes  
**[0:07:18-0:07:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:18):**  were my strongest focus, I guess.  And that led you to start focusing more on environmental technologies and AgTech.  How did that happen?  
**[0:07:28-0:07:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:28):**  How did you roll into that?  What were exciting moments you remember?  I mean, still you're involved in AgTech, but very soil focused, but let's say  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:34):**  before you took over the farm, what was your focus?  Well, I mean, basically partly through my history, right?  So I had all that, let's say financial knowledge and experience from the  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:45):**  university, then, then working in mergers and acquisitions with the bank.  After that, having done some restructuring, I knew that, you know, that  is a kind of skill set and an instrument that could be quite beneficial.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:58):**  And I didn't want to move, you know, too far away from that.  So I was looking for some situation where I can bring that in, but also, you know,  move towards things where my passion lies.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:09):**  So that being, let's say resources and land use.  And so I was between those two, having the financial side on one hand and, you  know, that new kind of way of, and vision of, of getting active in, in the natural  
**[0:08:23-0:08:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:23):**  world, so to say.  And then I was, you know, screening basically on a worldwide scale, you  know, how can you combine the two?  
**[0:08:30-0:08:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:30):**  How, what can you derive from that?  How can you develop that somehow?  And obviously I looked, looked towards the US and that was a time where you had  
**[0:08:40-0:08:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:40):**  like the first couple of startups in the ag space and you had you had VCs like  Koltivian, Antara was already doing their first fund.  Avrio was there also, but there was no ag fund.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:55):**  There was like the structure, the ag tech structure as we know today wasn't yet at  all actually developed.  But seeing that, like that idea of innovation, technological, digital  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:06):**  innovation in the agricultural space, I immediately thought, okay, wow.  I mean, this is it.  This is exactly what we need.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:12):**  We can only solve those huge problems through innovation and obviously  technology and, and digitalization obviously being a huge potential to that.  So after I kind of, I guess, I mean, found that or understood that well, like  
**[0:09:30-0:09:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:30):**  understood that incredible potential, I brought, let's say a pitch, so to say, and  started connecting and contacting and meeting all the large German agriculture  companies, potential investors.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:42):**  I looked for startups in the space.  I reached out to universities.  I started talking to different politicians and basically went around saying, guys,  
**[0:09:52-0:09:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:52):**  look, there's something happening here.  There's innovation being developed.  There's incredible potential and we, we need to be part of that.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:01):**  And I mean, going to a very traditional often also family-run company focused on  agriculture equipment and telling them about venture capital and investing into  must be an interesting experience.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:18):**  Yeah.  Hack, check innovation.  I mean, you know, I think those guys, they were always, you know, checking  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:24):**  underneath the table if I'm wearing shoes from made of wood or something, because  that was just not on the cards.  So there were never, they never heard of it.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:33):**  They never thought about that.  Like even the pronunciation of startup is something that they took like three,  three appointments to, to get, to get going.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:45):**  So basically I think that was like the first time that, that we, you know, try to  develop those kinds of ideas, but you could immediately see that if you come as a  25, 26 year old, you want to raise a fund, invest in act tech startups after the  
**[0:11:00-0:11:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:00):**  biotech bubble, having no track record.  I mean, that's just not a very good selling point, right?  I mean, I wouldn't give anyone money who would be in that position.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:09):**  So during that phase, I met someone who just raised or started a venture capital  corporate venture capital fund with Bill finger and building is also quite a  traditional company and different manufacturing and engineering processes.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:23):**  And because of their capability in, in water and garbage and renewable energy  technologies, they were already quite close to act tech let's say.  So I started working with them looking at the market in a, I guess, in a similar  
**[0:11:40-0:11:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:40):**  way, but then they had some serious problems with regards to revenue forecasts  and the share price fell from 84 to 40 something, which I think was the first in  German history to go down that badly.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:54):**  So obviously in those kinds of situations, venture capitalists is one of the things  I think, exactly.  I mean having to lay off 4,000 people and then telling someone that you'll invest  
**[0:12:05-0:12:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:05):**  into a startup.  I think it's, it's also a difficult one, but that was a time for me that obviously  I was very involved in the whole market of agricultural startups in Germany.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:18):**  I spoke to, you know, many of the associations so that that have some  connection to farming.  I did various talks and speeches at political institutes and political, like  
**[0:12:30-0:12:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:30):**  for the government.  And what I realized that, you know, all of those technologies, all of the  problems, all of the, let's say underlying fundamentals, all of that, let's say  
**[0:12:43-0:12:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:43):**  complexity was just overwhelming.  Right.  So I really had that strong feeling that in order to develop the market, to  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:54):**  develop that idea, to produce technologies, to help startups also find solutions.  You need people who are on the ground and you need people who are on the ground  and at the same time, open and willing and able to speak to all different interest  
**[0:13:10-0:13:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:10):**  groups.  Right.  I mean, you gotta be able to talk to an ecological farmer and a conventional  
**[0:13:15-0:13:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:15):**  farmer.  You gotta be able to talk to people who are from the conservation side.  You're gonna talk to large corporates like Bayer, for example.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:22):**  You gotta be able to talk to, or not only able, but willing to the politicians  because we can't solve those kinds of problems on our own.  No one can.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:32):**  It always has to be a sort of interdisciplinary multi-functional group of  actors and different actors coming together and saying, okay, let's do this.  Let's solve this thing.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:41):**  And this thing for you also, if I understand and remember correctly, slowly,  more and more and more, it started to click like this thing starts with soil.  Like it starts and ends probably with soil.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:53):**  And was it a realization that you always had or was it something that over these  many talks you did, many conversations you had, many companies and startups you  looked at, and obviously many farms you visited and you spend, I'm imagining also  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:07):**  time on the farm of your parents, that soil moment, was there a soil moment?  Was it a soil process?  How did that grow?  
**[0:14:16-0:14:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:16):**  Yeah, I mean, definitely.  I mean, that's a really good question.  I guess there was two moments that kind of came together.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:22):**  There was a soil moment and there was a me, myself and I moment, I guess.  But so after deciding...  That was a soil moment.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:32):**  I think they're pretty much the same.  But after starting, I took over the family farm in December 2016.  And obviously coming from, let's say, the technology side, I was deeply interested  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:44):**  and fascinated by the whole potential of, let's say, technology and digitalization.  And I thought innovation is key.  So basically we're situated one hour east of Berlin.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:55):**  And what is very special about the place is the combination of incredibly low  precipitation and sandy soil.  So as far as the precipitation is concerned, we have a 10-year average of around 450  
**[0:15:07-0:15:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:07):**  millimeters, whereas the last two years are around 200 to 300 millimeters per year.  And then the soil at the same time is very sandy.  So we have about between 1.1 and 1.5 percent organic matter.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:23):**  And that combination obviously is incredibly challenging for growing.  For growing, yeah, I mean, for growing anything really.  So yeah, I was thinking of specifying it, but I mean, it comes down to it that even  
**[0:15:40-0:15:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:40):**  a cactus needs some water.  So basically I came from the technology side and thought innovation is key, technological  innovation is key.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:51):**  And I was in contact with a couple of large agricultural equipment manufacturers saying  like, let's have an example of a farm, an ecological farm, 1,000 hectares, where we  completely bring in all the technology that we have, all the digital processes.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:08):**  And it's one hour east of Berlin.  We can have this place where people come together, potential buyers, customers, we'll do  events and just show what we actually can do already through technology.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:20):**  And through that process, I was sitting in my office looking outside and thinking, wow,  it's not raining.  And it continues to not rain.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:32):**  And I'm thinking, I'm reading about satellite and drones and this and here and forth.  And I was like, wow, it's, I mean, like the reality of what I'll see when I look out  of the window versus the theory of technology and instruments that I have on this contract  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:50):**  lying before me, it just has nothing to do with each other.  The one thing outside, the thing that I'm considering in the office, there is a huge  discrepancy between the two when it comes to actual, let's say, applicability.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:05):**  A practicality.  Practicality, yeah.  I mean, exactly.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:09):**  So I stopped all of that and said, okay, this can't be the solution.  And I thought, okay, so what is the by far most important asset and what is like the  thing I have to put all my focus on?  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:22):**  And then that's exactly where the soil moment really started because I was like, okay, I  mean, this is the key.  I mean, soil for us builds soil organic matter, grow healthy soil, build soil fertility.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:36):**  And that being said, I mean, it's the soil biology, the physics, chemistry, I mean, so  many things coming together.  If I manage to build that, then that is the key for any challenge that there might come.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:49):**  And I mean, there is going to come very many, right?  And then all kinds of technologies and all kinds of ag tech, et cetera, will be extremely  useful if focused on building soil.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:01):**  Exactly.  I mean, your soil moment.  Yeah.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:04):**  I mean, I think, you know, I don't want to sound like I don't think technology or digitalization  is not going to help us.  I think the potential is incredible, but it has to start from the soil.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:16):**  And what I see today in many, many, many cases, especially in agriculture, is that all the  technology, all the digital products that we have, they always try to fight a certain  problem, you know?  
**[0:18:30-0:18:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:30):**  But I think what we do in order to restore soil, in order to find agricultural land use  models that actually grow the soil and enhance biodiversity, is not fight the outcomes or  fight the problems, but maybe take a step back and think about the root causes of the  
**[0:18:49-0:18:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:49):**  problems and how we can actually change the root causes of the problems using nature,  like in line with nature.  And I think that was then, so to say, my moment, first realizing that, you know, the focus  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:05):**  has to be soil and then realizing that, you know, there's very different methods of doing  agriculture, of thinking agriculture, of understanding agriculture, and that, you know, being inspired  by, you know, all the legends, obviously, that we all know and the books that we all  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:22):**  read, you know, starting from Alan Savory, Gabe Brown, Joe Zalatin, Ernst Gertz from  Brazil, Elaine Ingham, understanding what these guys, you know, have been doing for  20, 30 years, which amazing ways of working with nature can help us in such a, yeah, I  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:41):**  mean, practical way, practical, amazing way.  And not taking away from, I think, the potential of technology and the potential of the  machinery and the potential of software and et cetera, but the goals of the system have  
**[0:19:57-0:19:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:57):**  to be right in this case.  Does it help farmers build soil at scale or does it enable farmers to do it faster or  does it enable someone like you to actually make other choices and other choices that  
**[0:20:09-0:20:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:09):**  you otherwise wouldn't have made?  Is technology actually enabling you to do more?  Exactly.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:14):**  I mean, I think today, as of now, we all like there's on the one side, you know, there's  people who are pushing, obviously, the developments of technology and let's say in a way  that, you know, we see agriculture being done on a huge scale at the moment.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:33):**  And then on the other side, if there is sites, but then there's this area, this other group  that is, you know, focused on, let's say, nature-based solutions, multifunctional land  use models, regenerative farming methods.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:46):**  And I think the combination of the two, which is already here and there on a small level,  it may be already happening, but I think once we bring those two groups together or those  two lines of thought, I think this is when agriculture will be just fascinating and like  
**[0:21:06-0:21:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:06):**  incredibly, let's say, helping.  Rewarding.  Yeah, rewarding not only for the farmer, but also on a wider scale.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:16):**  Because if you ask me, you know, farming in my belief is by far the biggest instrument  that we have for many of the big problems that we see today.  And I mean, we are talking about obviously CO2 sequestration, but we're also talking  
**[0:21:30-0:21:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:30):**  about health.  I mean, that is one of the main parts, food as medicine.  We're talking about inequality.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:36):**  We're talking about rural development.  We're talking about education.  I mean, and this is, I think, all in like not how do you say it?  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:45):**  Like this is all so strongly connected to the question of how we treat nature, how we  use nature in a way that we can actually enhance it and make it better.  And having that regenerative idea of land use, I think, yeah, it's something that we've  
**[0:22:03-0:22:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:03):**  already seen picking up so much in just the last couple of years.  But I think it's going to be the main thing that we'll be talking about and not only in  the agricultural space, but I think it will actually leapfrog into other industries, which  
**[0:22:15-0:22:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:15):**  we can already see.  And I think that is, that is incredible because, you know, that kind of concept coming out  of agriculture into other industries is, yeah, it's the way it should be, I guess.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:26):**  Yeah.  And I think it would be fascinating in this series because this is not the last time we'll  be discussing.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:33):**  We're definitely going to focus on transition finance and obviously on the farm you took  over and we're going to discuss that a bit later.  But it touches upon so many other things.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:42):**  It touches on ecosystem services, on land ownership, on healthcare, on CO2, on what  I mean there.  And we're not going to shy away from that.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:51):**  So I'm very excited to really dive deep into this case and to really see where we can get  with these models.  I want to ask you a bit on the vision of the farm, but actually beyond the farm, because  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:03):**  you look, in general, you look beyond things.  So you found it is a good imbecile.  Can you explain a bit what that is and what your beyond farming vision entails?  
**[0:23:14-0:23:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:14):**  Yeah, for sure.  Basically, so the idea is because we are situated one hour east of Berlin, we obviously have  quite a good connectivity for people that, you know, who are interested in those kind  
**[0:23:28-0:23:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:28):**  of, yeah, those kind of questions that we work on.  And as I said, like, you know, I believe that the role of us as farmers is far beyond what  we today think of.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:39):**  You know, it's not only primary production.  It is, and it can be, so many more fascinating things.  So we have a, well, we framed a name, so to say, for that concept, which we call beyond  
**[0:23:51-0:23:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:51):**  farming, which really consists of three different parts.  It's beyond sustainability, which is, of course, you know, the whole idea of saying,  well, we don't want to just sustain, you know, we want to make it better.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:01):**  So we find, or we're looking for different forms of multifunctional land use models and  bring them here on our challenging environment with a low precipitation and the sandy soil,  test them here, develop them here and see how they can be done in a way that they are  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:20):**  socially, ecologically and economically, let's say, beneficial.  So that is one part, bring in those different, you know, lines of thought, I guess, from  regenerative agriculture, just to show, you know, what is possible and what not.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:33):**  Stay Forever On a large scale, like a large commercial  farm, I think that's often forgotten, because often this research is done either in universities  or other places that maybe don't have to focus on profitability or need to have it because,  
**[0:24:46-0:24:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:46):**  I mean, you have people to pay or you have people to pay.  So there's this interesting, the farm as a platform or the land as a platform, but within  certain boundaries and certain, I mean, within the normal, let's say farming between brackets,  
**[0:24:59-0:25:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:59):**  normal farming system.  Yeah.  I mean, that's a good point.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:03):**  I think, you know, in order to really be part of a paradigm that is being changed or to  work into that, we can only make sure that it is applicable if we can scale it and if  it is economically feasible, right?  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:20):**  So you can think about ecological and social benefits all you want.  You need to find obviously a way that you can, as a farmer, earn good income from it  and be sustainable from an economic point of view.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:33):**  So yeah, you're absolutely right.  I mean, I think, you know, you have to bring it into the real context of being included  or, yeah, like a big part of running the farm or being, you know, the farm business.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:47):**  So yeah, we will try to scale it up at the same time.  Obviously there's, you know, so much knowledge to be captured, so much, let's say learnings  to be made that, you know, a way for us is also to have people come in that either are  
**[0:26:05-0:26:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:05):**  skilled in that area already, or that let's say do a monitoring of it, be it NGOs, be  it scientific groups, be it universities, to make sure that you can actually capture  all the experience and the learnings that you see.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:21):**  And I mean, there's just so many, right?  Yeah, sorry, I interrupted your beyond, the three points of beyond.  We are still beyond sustainability.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:29):**  Yeah, I was going to come back to that, but thank you for that.  No, so that's really, you know, that's the whole beyond sustainability part.  Then on another note, we always say beyond food, because I think to bring in, let's say,  
**[0:26:42-0:26:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:42):**  the public, to bring in also politicians, to bring in many people who are often, you  know, talking about agriculture, let's say without really being aware of it in that instance,  or who talk about food, but don't think about agriculture.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:58):**  I think it's always important to find a good, like you have to speak their language, right?  And coming too much, let's say from the agriculture angle, I think many are not yet there to understand  that link between the two.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:27:12):**  So when we have guests, when we have visitors, when we are somewhere invited to talk somewhere,  then we always come from, let's say, the food angle.  And so, yeah, start the conversation on food and then move them into agriculture and try  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:27:27):**  to establish a feeling of why the two are so strongly interconnected, why soil health  has to do with plant health, human health, animal health.  And I think it's a good way of starting a conversation and making people interested  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:27:42):**  about agriculture as such, because it is so strongly linked to emotions that you always  have to find a way how they can open themselves up for something that...  And start a discussion without polarizing it immediately.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:27:57):**  Because you lose people very quickly, which, or farmers in general, I mean, you lose people  in general very quickly in these topics, especially on animal agriculture, especially on GMOs,  especially on the big chemical companies.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:28:11):**  I mean, they're very rightfully so very touchy subjects.  Yeah, absolutely.  But food is something we all do.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:28:17):**  So yeah, it's a great way, a great segue into not starting to talk about soil immediately,  which we usually do.  But maybe it's not the best way, it's maybe to start to talk about food and how that came  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:28:29):**  from soil and the importance and the challenges and the opportunities.  Yeah, exactly that.  And I think when we have visitors or friends even here, one of the first things I always  
**[0:28:41-0:28:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:28:41):**  say is that I want them to be as honest and open as they possibly can.  Because I tell them what I think and I tell them all my thoughts and ideas and feelings  and whatnot.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:28:52):**  And if you have people visiting and them not being open, not asking questions, even if  they think it might be a question that I don't want to hear, you will never touch those points,  those emotions that you actually need to touch upon if you want to get into a real discussion  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:29:09):**  and if you even might want to change something either in yourself or in the one you're talking  to.  So and I think food is something where you can find that level quite easily and then  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:29:20):**  move on to more complicated matters.  So that's that part.  And the third is basically what we call beyond business or beyond farm business really.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:29:32):**  Because being, let's say, an actor in the rural area and obviously having, let's say,  the land that you're managing, the forest that you're managing, a lot of infrastructure  that goes with it, it's also there.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:29:46):**  It's not only primary production.  Like we always understand ourselves also as a platform.  So we work together with different startups that we assign certain fields from or we  
**[0:29:56-0:29:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:29:56):**  use a technology or use a product.  So we try to bring in some value for them.  At the same time, basically we lease land to a couple that are starting a market garden  
**[0:30:08-0:30:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:30:08):**  now.  And then the land that we're leasing is for us actually not too good to cultivate.  But for them, it's everything.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:30:17):**  So there's huge potential in that.  And also there's some synergies.  But it goes beyond that.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:30:22):**  It goes through basically educating people.  Right, I mean, you could invite schools, you can invite other kids to say, look, just use  the land for educating, use the land for all kinds of things.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:30:38):**  And it either goes beyond that and thinking about art.  I think about different alternative models of music.  Tell me about the gigantic root system that you had arrived on your farm as part of an  
**[0:30:56-0:30:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:30:56):**  art project.  Yeah, I'll upload a photo of that.  But basically, the area where we live here and where we farm is pretty much where the  
**[0:31:05-0:31:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:31:05):**  war ended.  And so all the old oak trees, I mean, they have seen it all in a way.  And next year in spring, we're celebrating the 75th anniversary of the ending of the  
**[0:31:17-0:31:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:31:17):**  war.  And for the Internationalism, the Second World War we're talking about.  Exactly, exactly.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:31:23):**  And we met this artist who's always been involved in history, German history, and also working  with wood.  And I said, man, what do you think about doing something together?  
**[0:31:34-0:31:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:31:34):**  I would love to do some sort of art project.  And so we thought about that idea and went back and forth.  And he said, don't you have an old root of an oak?  
**[0:31:44-0:31:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:31:44):**  And I was like, yeah, of course, we have plenty of those.  So we found this huge oak root, which is, I don't know, five, six meters wide.  And the tree is estimated to be around 200 years old.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:31:57):**  So basically, we took it out of the earth and carried it on the estate.  And now it's there to dry.  And next year, we're hoping to be able to put it in front of the or on the stairs of  
**[0:32:12-0:32:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:32:12):**  the Reichstag in Berlin.  And the art curatorium of the Bundestag will discuss it and think about it in January,  I think.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:32:22):**  So it's a parliament building of Berlin.  That would be a nice symbol.  Yeah, getting the roots.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:32:30):**  I've seen it.  We'll put a picture.  It's absolutely massive.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:32:34):**  And as it should be, it's a 200-plus year old tree.  But still, it's very impressive to see the full or a big part of the root system about  above ground and nothing is sort of.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:32:44):**  Yeah, I mean, it's incredible.  And I think also, the root is something that many people often don't think about.  And if you see that structure, it's just fascinating.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:32:54):**  I mean, it's really changing your look on things.  And I think that is really something that we have to do on such a great scale.  And that is, I think, why art ticks or has to have such a huge part of that whole discussion  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:33:06):**  we have today about changing the way we think about ecosystems, changing the way we think  about certain, let's say, economic processes, the setup of companies.  I mean, that is all somehow involved with the horizon, at least of the.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:33:21):**  Yeah.  I think in terms of art and education, there's an enormous role to make things visible, like  the root system, to make region X visible, to make the damages of the current access  
**[0:33:32-0:33:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:33:32):**  invisible, to make the potential and the imagination.  I think there's a huge role for that and something with the aesthetics of things and the taste  of things, I think are very closely connected and make all of these discussions just a lot  
**[0:33:47-0:33:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:33:47):**  easier and a lot more fascinating, honestly.  And I want to shift gears to, we're going to be extremely practical.  We're going to unpack a bit the farm.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:33:58):**  And we already mentioned a few things, but I want to start with a question, actually.  Why are you spending your time on a Friday afternoon to start what could be quite an  extensive journey to explore transition finance, not only for your farm, but actually the principles  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:34:13):**  of transition finance for many other farmers, let's say in Europe, but also actually outside  Europe.  What made you choose to take on next to all the farming, the root systems we discussed  
**[0:34:24-0:34:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:34:24):**  before to take on another project?  That's a good question.  And one that I've heard before, I guess.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:34:33):**  But when it comes to this podcast and the whole question of transitioning finance, I  think there's so many young people, there's so many progressive thinkers, there's so many  progressive farmers that are realising the situation that they're in.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:34:48):**  Obviously, there's some that are fighting to somehow stay alive, not only the farm,  but the families, the work, the passion that they have, the love that they have for farming.  And I think those are confronted with incredible problems and incredible, let's say, tasks  
**[0:35:06-0:35:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:35:06):**  ahead.  So there's that whole group of people who are pretty much forced to find a new way.  They are running out of options.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:35:14):**  And I think for them, transition financing in a way that still gives them enough flexibility,  that gives them enough freedom, that gives them the time, also, let's say, from a psychological  point, really, time to adapt, time to think about new ways, time to widen the horizon.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:35:32):**  I think that is a huge area for people who are passionate about agriculture.  Exactly.  And they really need it.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:35:40):**  So that's one part.  And I think another part is of people saying and realising, wow, there is this whole new  paradigm of agriculture, a new paradigm of coping with agricultural land, of cultivating  
**[0:35:53-0:35:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:35:53):**  land.  There's a whole new meaningfulness of doing agriculture.  And I want to get involved.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:36:00):**  I have me and my friends, I don't know, want to get involved.  How do we do that?  How can we get into that?  
**[0:36:05-0:36:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:36:05):**  How can we start?  How can we get going?  So for those people and those potential also new farmers, I think they are exactly at that  
**[0:36:16-0:36:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:36:16):**  point where they say, well, how can I actually start?  Because not having the land, not being in that industry already, it's close to impossible  to get going.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:36:25):**  And then there's a third group, which I guess I kind of consider myself part of, that is  already farming, maybe also faced with a couple of potential difficulties, but also incredibly  interested to develop further, to go new ways and at the same time seeing the incredible  
**[0:36:46-0:36:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:36:46):**  potential of it.  But at the same time having a certain responsibility towards employees, towards family, towards  maybe oneself, but also obviously towards the land.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:36:58):**  And I think that group is also saying, well, we've read all the books, we know, let's say,  the characteristics, we see the potential, we want to do it.  We believe we can hit a market.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:37:11):**  Yeah, we've done the pilots, we're ready to go.  But obviously there's incredible risks involved.  So I guess there's three different kinds of groups.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:37:20):**  There's probably many more, but for me, there's those large groups, which are all capable  and willing to move into that.  And just because there's so many people considering it, but all of which have to kind of go  
**[0:37:38-0:37:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:37:38):**  in unused waters, how do you say it?  Untapped waters.  In unknown waters.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:37:43):**  Yeah, exactly.  But still, I mean, it comes back to, it still doesn't mean you have to do this.  I want to definitely thank you for your time and that we're going to explore.  
**[0:37:54-0:38:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:37:54):**  It's time to talk a bit about the farm and to see, we prepared a nice document with an  overview, which we'll definitely link in the description below or wherever you're listening  to this podcast.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:38:06):**  So you can read this back, but we can do a few highlights of the farm just to have an  idea of size.  What are we talking about?  
**[0:38:13-0:38:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:38:13):**  And I mean, I think you already guessed that it's not a small one.  It's definitely bigger than your average few hectares.  And so can you give a short overview of Gutenbozo in terms of the farm, but also the bigger  
**[0:38:26-0:38:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:38:26):**  platform as you described it?  Yeah, sure.  I mean, basically we are a family farm.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:38:32):**  So both of my parents live here and my two older sisters live here with their kids.  Obviously I live here.  And what we're doing as a whole group, I guess, is basically ecological agriculture on roughly  
**[0:38:44-0:38:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:38:44):**  1000 hectares, forestry on another 2000 hectares.  There is a bed and breakfast with a couple of double rooms.  We have a small bakery that we use or that we can use.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:38:56):**  There is an old English garden that we look after as well as, you know, the let's say  different farm infrastructure that some of which you can use as an event room.  And we pretty much run all of that with, let's say, a total of 20 employees.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:39:13):**  I guess as far as the agricultural land is concerned, as I said, our average ground points  is around 35, which I think is a very German thing to say.  I'm not sure if it's actually internationally known, but just to give you an idea.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:39:29):**  So it's a classification of soil quality, whereas 100 is as good as it gets and zero  being the lowest.  So you're definitely in the lower region.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:39:39):**  Yeah, I think for Brandenburg, like the county that we're in, it's actually not that bad  as there's some that are worse.  But to give you an example, if you stand on the beach and you have the sand on your feet,  
**[0:39:50-0:39:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:39:50):**  then that's probably 16, 17, 18 ground points and we are 35.  So it should give you a good estimate of the quality.  So our average plot size is around 40 hectares and most of the fields are nicely situated  
**[0:40:08-0:40:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:40:08):**  around the farm, I guess.  So on a production note, basically our focus is grain production.  Well, our focus as of now is grain production between 70, 75% is actually in grain production.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:40:22):**  Usually we have spelt barley, rye, wheat, all the classic ones.  The rest is really legumes like sweet lupine and alfalfa.  And I mean, this is basically the farm structure.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:40:35):**  When I started over, what we have done since then and started with and experimenting with  is basically different forms of regenerative agriculture.  First of all, let's say a classical agroforestry system where we planted different species  
**[0:40:50-0:40:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:40:50):**  of popula and widow on a large field of roughly 30 hectares.  And those are basically just thin lines, double rows, evenly dispersed over the field, really  to see the effect on actually the grain production.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:41:05):**  So we know from the science that even if I reduced agricultural land by let's say 5 to  10% by introducing those tree lines, I could probably have the same yield on the remaining  the same or even higher yield on the remaining agriculture field just because of the introduction  
**[0:41:26-0:41:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:41:26):**  of the ecosystem functions of the biomass of the tree lines.  And I think that is so applicable to the place that we are.  I mean, we have this incredible drought time between really early spring, early summer.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:41:38):**  Also afterwards, the ground temperature sometimes reaches, I guess, 70, 80%.  You have this amazing radiation, heat, dryness.  So any tree, anything that can block that basically will help changing the local, the  
**[0:41:54-0:41:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:41:54):**  microclimate.  Exactly.  So I think that changing microclimate between the three lines, I think is going to have  
**[0:41:59-0:42:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:41:59):**  a huge impact also on an erosion.  Wind erosion is going to be a big thing.  And then, I mean, if there is water, if it rains, obviously the soil is in a way that  
**[0:42:11-0:42:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:11):**  it actually can't take up any of it.  Right.  So I think that agroforestry, that let's say simple agroforestry system is going to be  
**[0:42:18-0:42:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:18):**  very interested.  We have a couple of scientific facilities that are also, you know, monetizing the soil  development, let's say, or monitoring the soil development, which I think is going to  
**[0:42:30-0:42:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:30):**  be great.  Yeah.  That's the next step.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:32):**  I was going to say, damn.  Wow, you're advanced.  Wow.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:35):**  It's automatic.  It's transferring the Bitcoin straight to you.  Yeah.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:39):**  Yeah.  We'll see.  We'll see how that goes.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:40):**  Depending on the outcome, maybe you'll think about it, but yeah.  Then we have a project together with Ernst Gertsch, which is from Switzerland, and he  developed in Switzerland as well as in Brazil, basically a style of agroforestry, a biodynamic  
**[0:42:58-0:42:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:42:58):**  agroforestry, I would call it.  It's called syntropic agriculture.  Which is extremely advanced, right?  
**[0:43:04-0:43:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:43:04):**  And I think you're one of the first, or maybe even the first to do, first of all, at scale,  this is three and a half hectares in Germany.  I don't think I've seen anybody getting, first of all, Ernst Gertsch to Germany and then  
**[0:43:15-0:43:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:43:15):**  actually implementing one of these projects.  Or am I wrong?  Yeah.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:43:20):**  I mean, it took some motivation, I guess, to bring him over.  But I mean, his way of doing agriculture is quite popular in Brazil, in Argentina, and  also on a large scale.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:43:33):**  So it is being proven in a way there already.  And he started a couple of projects in Europe, one in Spain, one in Switzerland, one in Portugal,  and a few others.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:43:44):**  And then we are lucky to have him in Germany as well.  And well, the idea is really, and I think actually this is something so fascinating  about all those different lines of thought of regenerative ag.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:43:58):**  It's always the same characteristics, really.  I mean, it's always about keeping the soil covered, having a diverse crop rotation, having  a large diversity of plants and animals, all the large ones, less soil disturbance, obviously.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:44:13):**  And it's the same with the syntropic one.  And whenever I have visitors, then everyone is always like, yeah, but how can syntropic  agriculture work in your environment?  
**[0:44:22-0:44:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:44:22):**  And I always say, well, we're not going to plant any coca trees or bananas.  Exactly.  But the principles are similar, right?  
**[0:44:32-0:44:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:44:32):**  And obviously we're testing and developing.  We'll never be ready, but as from what we already can see today, I mean, there's just  incredible potential to it.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:44:41):**  So what we're doing there is basically having an agroforestry system where we're not only  looking obviously at popular, but we're looking at a combination of pioneering species with  nut trees, a pioneering species with different fruit trees, fruit bushes, having different  
**[0:44:56-0:45:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:44:56):**  layers within one tree line and obviously different potential usages at different times,  all having some sort of synergetic effect with each other and helping each other on  different levels, be it through fungi, be it through shadows, be it through different  
**[0:45:13-0:45:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:45:13):**  root structures.  So very versatile, very complex.  And those systems are always designed in a way that part of the system is actually for  
**[0:45:21-0:45:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:45:21):**  the system itself.  Basically the pioneer species will be pruned each year and the biomass that is being cut  is then brought back onto the soil to stimulate, let's say, nutrients and food for the soil,  
**[0:45:36-0:45:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:45:36):**  microbiology and biology, obviously.  And another part of the system is for producing nutritious food for people or actually animals  also.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:45:46):**  So that is a system that we're trying and we've just planted I think 1,500 trees and  bushes a couple of weeks ago, actually two weeks ago.  So then our next project is the animals.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:46:00):**  Yeah, you were mentioning it already.  Yeah, holistic grazing following Alan Savory, at least we're trying to, but it's really  tough when it comes to having your mobile fence and having no rain for eight weeks.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:46:15):**  Then I haven't yet found a mobile fence that is hard enough or good enough to get into  the ground.  So much to be learned.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:46:23):**  But anyway, so maybe some people that are listening that are operating in more desert  like circumstances have some tips for you.  Yeah, basically I know there is like we need that rolling kind of fence that is like on  
**[0:46:37-0:46:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:46:37):**  I think five different poles and it rolls above the ground.  I think that is a good way of doing it because you know our soil gets as hard as stone pretty  much.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:46:48):**  If it doesn't rain for a while then there's just nothing you can put in there as a fence.  But basically we have pretty much 20 calves.  We'll have our first calves, had our first calves a couple of weeks ago.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:47:02):**  We'll have another 20 hyphas coming beginning of next year and another or part of our soil  of our herd is going to have their cows also beginning next year.  So we'll have around 60 heads starting the year and obviously practicing let's say you  
**[0:47:24-0:47:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:47:24):**  know rotational grazing and you know learning and observing as much as we can.  One thing that we'll be starting to build within the next couple of weeks is our first  mobile laying hen house as well as three little groups for the broilers.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:47:42):**  And the broilers will go into the syntropic testing grounds and the laying hens will then  start to follow the cows in spring next year.  And as you have so much grain you for sure also have some leftovers to feed them.  
**[0:47:58-0:47:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:47:58):**  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean I think that is really one of the concepts that are easy to grasp.  Basically you know use potential side-offs or things that you don't actually have usage  
**[0:48:11-0:48:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:48:11):**  for and see how you can somehow create some value from it.  And as far as the grain is concerned I mean you know we have a cleaning facility for the  grain so there's so much left over, so much potential garbage grain so to say.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:48:26):**  That is a great feed potentially.  So we definitely use that.  And the same way with potential compost components.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:48:36):**  We've started doing some different experiments with composting.  So the classical vermicompost we've built four bioreactors following the Johnson-Sue  model which we're really fascinated and also excited about to get you know getting  
**[0:48:55-0:48:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:48:55):**  that microbiology and the bacteria and the fungi going.  So yeah it's a good project.  I'll show I could provide some photos of that later on as well.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:49:05):**  They look very impressive I have to say.  And you were mentioning that they actually get to some good temperatures but obviously  we have to see over the next months how that develops.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:49:17):**  And when you think I want to spend a few minutes I want to be conscious of our time as well  to spend a few minutes on when I say transition finance or when somebody mentions that in  this context of this farm what does that trigger to you?  
**[0:49:33-0:49:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:49:33):**  What would you be able to do if you had appropriate transition finance and what would that mean  in terms of this project that you just mentioned?  And the pilots, some are maybe out of pilot phase, some are definitely in the pilot phase.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:49:47):**  What would you do with transition finance?  That's a good question.  Which we're going to explore in the next episode.  
**[0:49:53-0:49:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:49:53):**  So like the first few thoughts, what comes to mind now on this Friday afternoon?  Exactly.  I mean what comes to mind?  
**[0:50:03-0:50:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:50:03):**  First of all I think there is a couple of learnings that one needs to have done or needs  to be in in order to know the way and the how which is applicable to the one in question.  I think that's something that we are really figuring out right now and we already have  
**[0:50:24-0:50:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:50:24):**  some or quite a good idea of what I understand or what I would like to understand I guess  when I hear transitioning finance it's basically a partner, a way of having a partner that  in the best case understands the situation that I am in, that we are in, understands  
**[0:50:47-0:50:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:50:47):**  why we want to change, how we can change, why it is profitable to go that way and by  saying profitable I don't only talk about monetization for me as a farmer or as us as  a farm operation but obviously talk about the ecological side effect, the social potential  
**[0:51:09-0:51:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:51:09):**  and let's say the industry as a whole.  On top of that having that idea of changing fundamental habits and changing the horizon  and that in a way that gives you the leeway to actually rethink certain ways and processes  
**[0:51:34-0:51:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:51:34):**  and also have the time.  I think I always call it…  Time is an interesting one.  
**[0:51:41-0:51:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:51:41):**  Yeah, at the time.  To be honest with you I always call it emotional freedom, that's what it is for me because  we are faced with so many pressures and fears and risks.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:51:56):**  It's sometimes as beautiful and inspiring and great it is to be a farmer and to be outside  and to do all of those things.  It is a huge pressure that you have, it's a huge responsibility you have, it's not  
**[0:52:12-0:52:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:52:12):**  only the family and the family of the people who are working on the farm, it goes beyond  that and I think in order to be able to change and to facilitate change you can't work  freely if you have that pressure on you all the time and if you have those fears about  
**[0:52:32-0:52:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:52:32):**  the future all the time.  So for me that idea of transitioning is also to have the feeling that you're not alone  in this game and there's someone or an institute that is being part of it, that understands  
**[0:52:45-0:52:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:52:45):**  it, that goes through the highs as well as the lows and that you can rely on and obviously  that goes both ways.  And what in this case, you mentioned a number of pilot projects and obviously we'll dive  
**[0:53:05-0:53:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:53:05):**  deeper into the different ones and we'll dive deeper with guests into all the aspects  of transition finance and obviously that's going to change over years as new things,  a lot of lessons will be learned.  
**[0:53:16-0:53:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:53:16):**  Would it now be mostly is it safe to say that most of let's say if you've got transition  finance, whatever shape or form that will take, now you would use it to speed up the  implementation of some of these because some are 30 hectares, some are three and a half,  
**[0:53:32-0:53:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:53:32):**  but it's very expensive to do cover crops everywhere and it's very expensive to plant  trees and very risky because not everything has been figured out yet.  So you are looking for basically fuel to speed up the process and at the same time by time,  
**[0:53:49-0:53:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:53:49):**  it's this constant tension between speeding up and actually going slower and take a step  back and actually have that emotional freedom which you mentioned.  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:53:58-0:54:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:53:58):**  I mean that is completely right.  I think when it comes to the level on the ground level of the different projects, I  would have a pretty good idea of where to start if I was going to speed up or if I wanted  
**[0:54:12-0:54:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:54:12):**  to speed up.  And what kind of sizes are we thinking of?  Is it are we discussing 5,000, 500,000, 5 million or 50 million?  
**[0:54:22-0:54:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:54:22):**  What is the dimension without going into euro details, what are dimensions people should  think about if they're going to also help us and reach out with feedback, with ideas,  with people to interview, et cetera, that we are talking about at this large scale farm  
**[0:54:37-0:54:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:54:37):**  because it is a thousand hectares plus the forestry part where we talk about the farming  part now.  What are the dimensions you are at least thinking of and calculating with, let's say in your  
**[0:54:45-0:54:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:54:45):**  models?  Yeah, basically.  I mean, obviously there's different ways of, let's say the speediness of the process that  
**[0:54:53-0:54:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:54:53):**  you want to take and also the scale that you want to consider.  But from what I've experienced so far from the things that I've seen and I think I have  a good idea also of let's say the financial applications, I would probably have a discussion  
**[0:55:12-0:55:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:55:12):**  of, let's say something between 500,000 and a million to really take a couple of bigger  steps and I think that's, yeah, I mean, you know, that's already quite a lot.  It's a lot and it's nothing if we talk about some movements in the space or movements in  
**[0:55:32-0:55:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:55:32):**  the finance space, but yeah, it's an enormous amount of money if you look at your general  bank account.  Exactly.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:55:39):**  And I mean, this is really where suddenly that whole discussion of transition financing  on an emotional level makes you feel how important it is.  Because if you think that in a usual bank loan, so to say, having that figure just in  
**[0:55:58-0:56:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:55:58):**  front of you, that is a lot of money on the farm level, let's say.  And I think that it makes it quite tangible why that whole idea of transition financing  is so important because you have to think about a way that you can work with that money  
**[0:56:15-0:56:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:56:15):**  and actually develop and achieve what you're setting out to or what you're trying to in  a way that, yeah, as we've already said, give you the freedom and the time to actually work  with it and not having to worry and not having to think about annuities and the bank that  
**[0:56:36-0:56:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:56:36):**  is not going to be on your side of the table.  Right.  I think that's exactly, I think that's a critical part really.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:56:43):**  We would love it to be.  I mean, if your local bank, talking to all the farmers that hopefully listen, is that  partner and has the principles that we're going to explore in this series and is honoring  
**[0:56:55-0:56:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:56:55):**  that, then obviously it will be ideal and you can find that money somewhere.  But what we've seen in many of these discussions, like this finance to transition farms often  isn't there or is very badly or unfairly, let's say, structured.  
**[0:57:10-0:57:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:57:10):**  So we're going to explore those questions and they're going to be uncomfortable questions  and they're going to be difficult ones in the next episodes with guests actually on  the show.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:57:19):**  So we're going to have people that are deep into the space and I'm going to ask them to  see and look at this case and say, okay, how would you finance this if you were in those  shoes?  
**[0:57:28-0:57:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:57:28):**  So I'm extremely excited to explore that further over the next months and dive deeper into  the transition finance piece and everything that unlocks as well.  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:57:38-0:57:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:57:38):**  I mean, I guess I'm kind of looking forward, it's a combination of looking forward and  being scared of the kind of things that we'll have to talk about, the kind of connections  that we'll make, I think are going to be incredibly interesting.  
**[0:57:54-0:58:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:57:54):**  And it'd be great to hear also from a potential audience that is interested in the space,  what kind of questions they have.  I know what kind of problems they see or fears that they have, because I think as far as  
**[0:58:08-0:58:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:58:08):**  farming is concerned, it's so heterogeneous and the things and the questions that I ask,  the problems that I have, the considerations that I think about are obviously all my problems.  This is supposedly really not about me, it's just an idea of starting a conversation on  
**[0:58:27-0:58:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:58:27):**  let's say on a farmer's level.  So yeah, I mean, it would be great to hear some other...  Get in touch.

**[0:59:21-0:59:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:59:21):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:59:43-0:59:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:59:43):**  Why are we doing this course?  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been following the space since 2011  
**[0:59:53-0:59:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:59:53):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  How have we built our decision making framework?  
**[1:00:03-1:00:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:00:03):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?  
**[1:00:11-1:00:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:00:11):**  What should you read?  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  
**[1:00:15-1:00:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:00:15):**  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course?  You the soil builders and investors in this space, the soil builders, people working in  
**[1:00:23-1:00:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:00:23):**  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing,  platform builders, act tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line  designers, holistic management consultants, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[1:00:36-1:00:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:00:36):**  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital banks, insurance companies,  
**[1:00:50-1:00:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:00:50):**  et cetera.  Is this course free?  No.  
**[1:00:53-1:00:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:00:53):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[1:01:04-1:01:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:01:04):**  different means.  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[1:01:13-1:01:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:01:13):**  Thank you.  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[1:01:21-1:01:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:01:21):**  So you don't have to ride along.  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky.  
**[1:01:29-1:01:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:01:29):**  How to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to invest  in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find if  you're a soil builder.  
**[1:01:40-1:01:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:01:40):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[1:01:53-1:01:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:01:53):**  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:01:59-1:02:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:01:59):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[1:02:10-1:02:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=1:02:10):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking, click on  the link below, sign up and I'm really looking forward to your feedback.

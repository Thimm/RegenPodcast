**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:00:00):**  You're listening to the summary of the interview. For a link to the full length episode, please check the description below.  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the planet mattered  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  To learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil people local communities and ecosystems  while making an appropriate and fair return  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:00:28):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration because so many of the pressing issues we face today  have their roots in how we treat our land grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors  big and small and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt soil underneath our feet  Before we get started I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I will definitely  continue to do so and release about an episode a month but at the same time I would love to take

**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:01:22):**  And now without further ado the interview. Enjoy!  Welcome to a new episode I'm Koon Vassaian your host and today I interview Paul Chatterton  founder of the landscape finance lab experimental unit inside the World Wildlife Fund they incubate  sustainable landscapes and structure launch and fund deals at landscape scale  The landscape finance lab was set up three years ago in WWF we've been successful at winning many battles but  
**[0:01:56-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:01:56):**  you know that that war is absolutely being lost there are half as many animals on this planet now  in the wild as there were when I was born 50 years ago it's a disaster and the tools we have at the  moment are not up to the challenge we need to change the whole way that we're working if we're  going to to save nature and we need to shift whole economies to being green and supporting  sustainability how do we do programs to save nature and promote green economy at the scale  
**[0:02:38-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:38):**  of a million hectares 100 million dollars investment dealing with a with with a million tons  of traded goods a million people we've got to be able to operate at that scale as a nature  conservation organization if we're going to save nature but the planet needs that as well if we're  going to to reach the SDGs the global goals that's actually the real beauty of the landscape approach  you know the when you're looking when you're dealing with with small issues you know a logging  
**[0:03:13-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:03:13):**  operation or a farm and and sustainability issues then over a short time frame at a small space  you end up with conflict you've got very little room to move between the players with a landscape  program you can all take a breath because you can think about landscape you have to think about  landscapes over at least a 10-year period ideally in generation or more you've got to think about  them over a much larger space which then gives you all the ability to to be more creative to move  
**[0:03:47-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:03:47):**  move operations over time rather than immediately to to restore forests or or water flows or whatever  so the important principle is that you know the landscapes have to have to build themselves the  people in the landscapes have to already be very organized and ready to go on to the next stage  so we we have a an online platform people fill out details just some basic details about where  they're up to they need to show that they've got the scale if anyone can can kick off a landscape  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:04:22):**  program the fundamental principle though is that they then have to form a multi-stakeholder  partnership a group of people who want to solve a problem in that landscape they go through a  process of of understanding the landscape better and the problem and each other and and then they  develop a collaborative plan to address the problem it's quite quite simple and then we help  them with that and with with with getting the financing for the individual activities to to  
**[0:04:53-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:04:53):**  address the problem and that might be grant financing it might be carbon financing or more  you know more recently where we're starting to show the ability to bring in private financing  into areas basically Fiji is is killing his own reef not only because of we're all polluting way  too much and the temperature in the ocean and acidity is going up but also because of the  run-offs of their farms on the islands right nutrients the the pesticides and fertilizers  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:05:26):**  poison the reefs the silt from from housing developments the poo from the tourists the  tourists come are destroying what they come to see in fact so how do we shift that around we  we helped 15 organizations of four government departments a number of NGOs industry groups  banks to put together a 115 million dollar call for saving the reefs of Fiji and and that involved  shifting over to organic agriculture shifting to sustainable fisheries and restoring the  
**[0:06:05-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:06:05):**  mangrove forest and the river forests and and dealing with waste management and we're now  developing a 30 million dollar public sector funding program with the Fijian government  for us it's been it's been understanding how businesses work and what bankers need  to invest in good businesses the last year has been a really dramatic learning curve for us  listening to to bankers shadowing them understanding what they would invest in them  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:06:40):**  and wouldn't and then working with the businesses to see from their side  whether that sort of thing makes sense and whether they can they can deliver impact  we're just starting we're learning learning day by day it's it's really really quite exciting  but i think one of the one of the key lessons we learned is that you know our best friends are the  the local banks and local financial institutions the Fiji development bank the Fiji reserve bank  
**[0:07:08-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:07:08):**  ANZ bank in Fiji they have been very very useful and supportive players we didn't realize how  excited they'd get by this and and and how valuable it would be for them as well  right from the first day that's our principle is landscapes first the the team on the ground  leads it we provide the resources to the people that are in the area and we provide the resources  to the people that are in the area and we provide some support and coaching but it's  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:07:43):**  they make the decisions and our goal is to help them to get the resources to build this slowly  and steadily until they've got a hundred million dollars between them to to really shift the needle  to change change what's happening in their landscapes and i think that's a that's a big  thing the world is run from New York and Geneva and Frankfurt the money goes out it's it's brought  out by people from those countries who do work with locals and then the the profit and control  
**[0:08:16-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:16):**  goes back if we can put the finance and the control in the hands of the people in the  landscape and they've got a they've got an incentive to look after their own their own home  much more than the people on the other side of the world do well the advantage of a landscape  approach we're finding is that it you know it it gives you all of the stakeholders you'd want to  talk to if you're a business you don't have to do that work yourself it gives you a set of very  
**[0:08:46-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:46):**  clear and simple sdg targets that you can work towards and monitoring systems to to measure those  so you don't have to do that yourself it helps with the regulatory questions that you have as  a business in doing fish farming or or growing ginger and turmeric or whatever it might might  be that you're growing and it gives you a bigger goal that you can contribute to  so our theory is that if you can if you can save and sustainably manage a hundred landscapes  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:09:22):**  if you can get them to the point where they meet the sdg goals then then you meet the sdgs on the  planet and uh you know our costings at the moment for building a landscape program and getting  investment is somewhere between 100 million and a billion dollars per landscape so that's more  expensive than a fighter jet but cheaper than an aircraft carrier and there's no reason why the  the world couldn't find find that money we have to we have to now build the machinery to actually

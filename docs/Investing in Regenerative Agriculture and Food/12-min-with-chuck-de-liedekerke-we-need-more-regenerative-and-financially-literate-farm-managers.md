### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Tue, 04 Jun 2019 02:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:00:00):**  You're listening to the summary of the interview. For a link to the full-length episode, please check the description below.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:00:08):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture â€“ Investing as if the Planet Mattered,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:00:14):**  a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:18-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:00:18):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities and ecosystems  
**[0:00:25-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:00:25):**  while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:00:28):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration? Because so many of the pressing issues we face today  
**[0:00:32-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:00:32):**  have their roots in how we treat our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:00:36):**  And it's time that we, as investors, big and small, and consumers,  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:00:40):**  start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:00:46):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:00:50):**  and I will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:00:54):**  But at the same time, I would love to take this further, share more interviews,  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:00:58):**  there are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture,  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:01:02):**  more depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:01:06):**  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:01:11):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means,  
**[0:01:15-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:01:15):**  I invite you to support me and make this happen.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:01:18):**  For more information, please find the link to my Patreon account in the description below.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:01:22):**  And now, without further ado, the interview. Enjoy!  
**[0:01:33-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:01:33):**  You'll be listening to an interview with Chuck, an ex-investment banker  
**[0:01:36-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:01:36):**  who turned regenerative farmland manager.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:01:38):**  He talked about one of the great bottlenecks of scaling the regenerative agriculture business.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:01:43):**  The shortage of good, professional regenerative farmland managers  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:01:48):**  and the role of retail and processing companies in this transition.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:01:52):**  Very quickly, a light bulb went up in my head, where I realized that  
**[0:01:58-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:01:58):**  obviously there are clear environmental benefits and social benefits for regenerating land,  
**[0:02:06-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:02:06):**  whether it be through livestock management or through any form of regenerative activity.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:02:12):**  But economically, if you can buy a marginal asset, which is unproductive,  
**[0:02:21-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:02:21):**  and transform it not only into a fertile piece of ground,  
**[0:02:28-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:02:28):**  but also have an operation that is yielding cash flows on it,  
**[0:02:34-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:02:34):**  then you're very powerfully aligning environmental outcomes and good financial performance.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:02:44):**  And the moment you demonstrate that the right economic choice is regenerative,  
**[0:02:51-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:02:51):**  you have the potential to completely transform how capital is allocated in agriculture.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:03:03):**  And there are trillions of dollars allocated throughout the agriculture value chain.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:03:08):**  If you want to drive meaningful environmental change,  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:03:12):**  you're going to need to make it more profitable than the current state of affairs.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:03:19):**  Our approach has always been to look at these operations  
**[0:03:26-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:03:26):**  and incrementally change them as to not compromise cash flow generation.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:03:36):**  Typically what we do is we look at the agrochemical package that is currently being applied on the land  
**[0:03:44-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:03:44):**  and through a more fine-tuned analysis of what the plant requires in terms of nutrition and protection,  
**[0:03:53-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:03:53):**  adapt a package that is all too often very standard and very conventional to the plant's needs.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:04:01):**  That will immediately allow for some savings to occur.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:04:05):**  And part of those savings we show back to the owners of the farm.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:04:10):**  Another part of those savings we reinvest in trial areas  
**[0:04:16-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:04:16):**  to demonstrate that the regenerative practices will deliver better financial outcomes.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:04:23):**  So we'll plant a cover crop, we'll apply some compost, we'll invest in some no-till equipment  
**[0:04:31-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:04:31):**  and really try to demonstrate as fast as possible that no short-term economic impact,  
**[0:04:39-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:04:39):**  negative economic impact was necessary to kickstart a transition and to continue that transition.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:04:50):**  The idea is really to get the landowners or the farm managers at our own location  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:04:57):**  convinced about the merits of our approach.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:05:02):**  And unless they can really see it for themselves,  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:05:06):**  the risk of setting yourself up to fail is very big.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:05:10):**  So that initial trial period for us is necessary  
**[0:05:15-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:05:15):**  simply in order to have the right relationships with the farm managers.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:05:27):**  For us we have five principles.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:05:30):**  And we should build this into some form of a common definition of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:05:35):**  These principles are minimal land disturbance, permanent cover of the soil with vegetation,  
**[0:05:44-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:05:44):**  maximization of biodiversity in time, which means rotations,  
**[0:05:51-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:05:51):**  but also in space, which means companion crops.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:05:54):**  And it also means the introduction of ruminants, livestock in the system.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:06:02):**  And the last piece is what we call context-specific design.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:06:06):**  And this draws from the principles of permaculture.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:06:10):**  And we try to apply really an adaptation of the production unit to its environment,  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:06:17):**  to the topography, to the climate, to the features of the landscape on large-scale farms.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:06:23):**  It's just as important to have an extremely professional farmer as to have a regenerative farmer.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:06:31):**  You need to trust him or her, and this person needs to be able to execute a plan.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:06:37):**  In very challenging circumstances.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:06:39):**  The isolation and the willingness to be different is probably the most complex piece.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:06:46):**  But you need to add on top of that the fact that you have to be able to do it.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:06:51):**  But you need to add on top of that that this person needs to be financially literate.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:06:59):**  You know, when we're raising capital, we talk about regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:07:04):**  but from the point of view of the farmer that's day in, day out practicing this thing,  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:07:08):**  it's still a very different reality.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:07:11):**  And it's very clear that we need to open our eyes to what their reality is.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:07:17):**  But it's just as true that they need to be open to what the investor's reality is,  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:07:23):**  and what the investor's expectations are.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:07:26):**  We have realized that the farmers usually are very good at controlling their costs,  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:07:35):**  very good at optimizing their volumes.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:07:40):**  But when it comes to price, most farmers are still price takers.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:07:55):**  What we believe is, you know, a plant grown in a healthy soil will have a greater ability to metabolize complete protein chains,  
**[0:08:07-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:08:07):**  will have an ability to metabolize the plant's secondary metabolites,  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:08:14):**  or what is more commonly called essential oils that are responsible for the flavors,  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:08:19):**  but also some of the health benefits that we recognize in fruits.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:08:23):**  And so when we say that a fruit has lost, you know, X amount of its nutritional value  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:08:30):**  since the moment our grandparents were eating, or our age, sorry,  
**[0:08:36-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:08:36):**  what we mean is that the soil is not alive enough to allow the plant to feed itself from it  
**[0:08:46-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:08:46):**  and to metabolize its minerals into full protein chains and complete plant secondary metabolites.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:08:55):**  We need to be ready when the sector changes, and the sector meaning the food sector,  
**[0:08:59-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:08:59):**  when the farm to fork, which now somehow stops at the farm gate,  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:09:04):**  but the farm to fork movement starts looking at nutrient rich food or dense food,  
**[0:09:09-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:09:09):**  certainly more and more taste, which you see already a bit,  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:09:12):**  and that line between healthy soil, healthy plants, healthy produce and healthy gut,  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:09:17):**  and thus healthy people becomes a much straighter one in the next, let's say, hopefully five years.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:09:23):**  So we need to be ready to supply that demand, which is probably going to get quite big.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:09:35):**  We often say with the team here that farmers could come to regenerative agriculture for the premium  
**[0:09:41-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:09:41):**  and stay for the cost savings.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:09:49):**  I would encourage investors to meet with regenerative farmers  
**[0:09:57-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:09:57):**  and to have meaningful conversations with them, because it's still a work in progress,  
**[0:10:06-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:10:06):**  and there's a lot that's being invented.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:10:08):**  I would also talk to the investors that have already a few years behind their belts  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/10/chuck-de-liedekerke/#t=0:10:16):**  with capital allocated into these projects to understand from them,

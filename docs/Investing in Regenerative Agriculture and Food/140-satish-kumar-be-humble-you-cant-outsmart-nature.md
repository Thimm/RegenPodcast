**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:00:14):**  Today a different conversation.  We have an 85 year old author and philosopher and probably the most importantly a gardener  about the role and your role and our role in nature and what can investors do and how  
**[0:00:26-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:00:26):**  to be humble and so much more.  Be ready for the energy coming out of your speakers because Satish might be 85 but has  more energy than most people I know.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:00:36):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if  the Planet Mattered.  A podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:46-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:00:46):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:00:58):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  our land, grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors, big and small  and consumers, start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:01:14):**  In March last year we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:01:25):**  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.

**[0:01:38-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:01:38):**  Thank you.  So today a very special episode with the founder and director of programs at the Schumacher  College, an international center for ecology studies and the editor emeritus of resurgence  
**[0:01:49-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:01:49):**  and ecologists.  And mind you he did a peace walk a few years ago of 8,000 miles which is a bit more than  the 10,000 steps that we all try to do per day and very importantly wrote a very interesting  
**[0:02:00-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:02:00):**  book on soil, soul and society.  Welcome Satish.  My pleasure to be your guest.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:02:07):**  And to start with a personal question, I have a thousand questions probably, but why are  you focusing quite a bit of your attention, your writing and of course also your daily  work on the soil, the food and the agriculture space?  
**[0:02:20-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:02:20):**  You know, in the world today we all talk about economic growth and economy, economy, economy,  but they don't understand what economy means.  They think economy means money.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:02:37):**  But economy is a very beautiful word and economy relates to ecosystem, ecology and soil is  the source of ecology.  Soil is life itself.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:02:54):**  Everything what we have comes from soil.  Our body is made of soil.  Our food we eat is soil transformed.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:03:04):**  The mangoes, the oranges, the apples, the grapes, the bread, the rice, everything what  we eat is nothing but soil.  Houses are made of soil.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:03:15):**  The wood is soil.  The stones are soil.  So soil is everything.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:03:21):**  At this moment, particularly soil is important because of climate change and the soil is  the real bank of carbon.  It can sequestrate and hold carbon.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:03:33):**  So at the moment I would like all politicians, business leaders, corporate leaders, economists,  educationists, all to focus on soil.  Soil is a source of life.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:03:46):**  And what would you tell them?  Soil seems also sacred, but yet there are many people that are saying if we don't quantify  ecosystem services like the carbon piece you just mentioned or the biodiversity and the  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:03:59):**  water storage or infiltration, then we'll never get the investors interested.  We'll never get the financial world, that is not the economy, but the financial world  interested in it.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:04:08):**  I feel attention there.  Do you feel that too?  And what would you say to people that are working on these ecosystem services and getting  
**[0:04:15-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:04:15):**  them payable and thus maybe getting all the politicians, et cetera, interested in this  dirt under our feet?  Yes.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:04:24):**  Ecosystem services is a kind of metaphor.  As long as you know that the measurement of nature can only be a kind of shorthand, in  the long run you cannot measure the value of nature, value of soil.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:04:44):**  You cannot measure how much your breath is worth.  You cannot value how much your water is worth.  If you pay more for milk and less for water, it's not less valuable.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:05:00):**  Just because you pay less than milk doesn't mean that water is less valuable.  You can live without milk, but you cannot live without water.  Just because something is free, the sunshine is free, but doesn't mean the sunshine has  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:05:13):**  no value, even though you cannot measure how much sunshine is valuable.  But you pay to go to France or to Italy or to Greece or somewhere for holiday or Goa,  but the sunshine is freely given.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:05:29):**  So in the end, we cannot put monetary value on nature.  But in the meantime, as a metaphor, just to communicate, to understand how valuable the  natural systems are for us in monetary terms, we can use ecosystem services and monetary  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:05:49):**  value as a kind of shorthand on a very superficial level.  But in the heart of heart, we have to understand that nature is beyond monetary value.  So let's say it's a transition.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:06:03):**  We can use it now to get people hooked to the world of soil, the immense possibilities,  and use it even though we cannot properly fully measure nature.  We can use a proxy or we can actually kickstart the regeneration by using ecosystem services,  
**[0:06:20-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:06:20):**  even though we all know it's not perfect.  Yes, our language is a kind of tool and we can use the language to understand something  deeper which goes beyond language, beyond measurement.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:06:33):**  But our modern science and modern economy and modern technology somehow have to come  to believe that what you cannot measure does not exist.  Only what exists that you can measure.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:06:48):**  I think that is a bit too narrow a view.  We have to say, yes, we can measure something.  We can measure the length and breadth of something.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:06:57):**  But we cannot measure love.  We cannot measure friendship.  We cannot measure the value of a mother.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:07:06):**  How much the mother's breast milk.  It may be very little for the baby, only 4% or 3% of protein in mother's milk.  And yet without that milk, we will not exist.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:07:19):**  So we have to always understand that there are measured measurements and we can measure  things and they are important.  They are matter.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:07:28):**  But there's more than matter, more than measurement.  That is value.  The meaning, the meaning of what we are doing.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:07:36):**  You can measure the house is this long and this wide, but the meaning of the house is  more how you live there.  So measurement and meaning must come together.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:07:47):**  Measurement and meaning should be married rather than separated.  At the moment, people have separated meaning from the measure and they only value measure  and they don't value meaning.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:07:58):**  This is a problem of our time.  You said language is important.  I think we can all agree or many would agree ecosystem services is a horrible term.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:08:07):**  Do you have a better suggestion how to call these two more?  Marry those two like we're measuring something.  We know it's not perfect, but it gets us to a world of more meaning.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:08:17):**  Are there better terms that you know of that can capture a bit of the complexity and still  something we can potentially measure?  I think I'm not denying the importance of measurement for material things you can measure,  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:08:30):**  but for that, there is a non material aspect of life and that you cannot measure.  So meaningful measurement, meaningful measurement is my word.  If you have a meaningful measurement, then ecosystem services can be a useful way to  
**[0:08:48-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:08:48):**  approach.  And let's talk a bit about Schumacher College, which I've heard about a lot.  I've never been.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:08:54):**  I know a few people that have attended.  Can you share a bit more about that story of how it started because you were there absolutely  at the beginning and where it like what it morphed into, what it evolved into now as  
**[0:09:07-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:09:07):**  we're talking end of October 2021.  Schumacher College is a nature centered education.  At Schumacher College, we say that education is not only to get a job.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:09:19):**  I hope so.  To be successful in your life and have a big car or a big house or have a name, fame, prestige,  power, status, control.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:09:32):**  These are the egocentric education.  Schumacher College is an ecocentric education.  We move from ego to eco.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:09:40):**  Eco is about relationship.  We all exist in mutuality and reciprocity.  So we educate our young people at Schumacher College so that they can go out in the world  
**[0:09:51-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:09:51):**  and live in harmony with nature, look after the soil, look after the trees and how we  enhance our relationship on the basis of mutuality and reciprocity.  And also at Schumacher College, we have education of head, education of heart and education  
**[0:10:08-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:10:08):**  of hands.  So all our students touch the soil, all our students partake in the gardening.  And Schumacher College is based at an estate called Dartington Hall.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:10:21):**  And this estate is 1000 acres.  And at a part of Schumacher College, we have two programs.  Program number one is training in the gardening.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:10:33):**  So we have about 20 students coming to Schumacher College for six months.  They come in April and they stay there until September.  And these six months, they learn about all agroecological principles, permaculture principles.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:10:49):**  So agroecology, permaculture, no-dig gardening, organic gardening, biodynamic gardening, all  methods of sustainable and regenerative gardening so that we build the soil because soil is  the bank for carbon.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:11:06):**  Soil is the home for the millions of microorganisms.  Soil is a source of life.  And so we teach our young people how to look after the soil and how to build soil so that  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:11:19):**  we can have economy of nature for millions and millions of years to come.  But in addition to that six months program of gardening, we have a master's program in  food and farming in a regenerative way, regenerative food and farming.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:11:37):**  And that's a master's program because we, as I said, we have 1000 acres of land and  we are looking for people to invest if they can and come with some funding as well.  We need some funding.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:11:50):**  So we are going to use this 1000 acres to create an example of regenerative farming,  regenerative food system, and training young people.  Even we think that at the moment, agriculture is neglected.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:12:04):**  In our society, we value computers and cars and industry and business and cities and the  farmers are kind of left behind.  Only if you are uneducated, you are not smart, you are not clever, then you live in the village  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:12:22):**  and you farm.  And even the farmers don't want their children to go in farming, but farming has no money,  no much capital.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:12:30):**  So everybody wants to go and work in a bank.  If you are working in a bank, you get hundreds and thousands of euros or pounds or dollars  paid to you.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:12:39):**  But if you are working on a farm, you are a farm laborer or farm worker or farmer, you  get maybe 100 pounds or 200 pounds a day.  So this is the kind of status of farming in our society is very, very low.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:12:52):**  At Schumacher College and at Dartington, we want to lift the status of farming.  We want to say that farming is more important than banking.  Farming is more important than creating computers.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:03):**  Farming is more important than politics.  Farming is more important than industry.  But without farming, there is no food.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:09):**  And without food, humans cannot exist.  And in order to do good farming, we have to build good soil.  Soil is a living soil.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:17):**  And we have to revere and respect the sacred living soil.  So this is why at Schumacher College, we have these two programs to teach young people how  to do regenerative gardening and how to do regenerative farming.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:32):**  And so I hope that your listeners can visit Schumacher College website and see what we  are doing.  And if they are interested, please get in touch with us and we can do some work together.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:43):**  Absolutely.  I will put a link below.  Yeah, we have land, but we are looking for some capital.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:48):**  I will put a link below and also if people are interested, obviously, to attend the courses  to become involved in other ways.  I think it's more than highly recommended.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:58):**  And what have you seen change over time?  I mean, Schumacher College, I think, was founded 30 years ago.  What has changed, if something, what has changed in the courses?  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:07):**  What has changed in the outside world?  Is there more attention or less attention?  Has soil become more important finally?  
**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:13):**  Or actually, we're at the same level as we were 30 years ago when you started?  You know, this is good news.  Let's start with that.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:20):**  When we started Schumacher College and when we started to talk about climate change, our  first teacher was James Lovelock, the author of Gaia Hypothesis.  That wasn't bad.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:32):**  Yeah.  And at that time, James Lovelock was not listened to.  People were not paying attention to the work of James Lovelock.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:41):**  And we were talking about climate change in 1991 and in the early 90s.  At that time, they were not paying much attention.  Everybody say, oh, it's not man-made.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:51):**  It's nothing to do with us.  It's a kind of natural phenomena happening.  And sometimes people say, maybe there is no climate change.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:58):**  But now, in the last 30 years, there has been a tremendous transformation in consciousness.  More and more people around the world are rising to the challenge and realizing that  we are facing a climate catastrophe.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:15:15):**  If we don't change our way, if we don't use more natural resources and more renewable  energy resources, we are facing a great urgency.  And we are facing a catastrophe as well.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:15:30):**  Because you know, the oil and the coal and the gas come from the underworld.  We have to go deep down, thousands of meters under the world to get this dark gold.  I call it energy from the hell because it's dark energy, underworld energy.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:15:53):**  So our answer to that is that we must go to the energy, which is light energy, energy  from heaven.  If you have energy from the sun, energy from the rain, energy from the wind, energy from  
**[0:16:07-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:16:07):**  the water, that energy is light energy, free of charge, provided by nature, which will  use that energy from heaven.  If you use energy from the hell, you create hell on earth.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:16:20):**  If you use energy from heaven, you create heaven on earth.  Therefore, the climate change, answer to climate change is use energy from heaven.  Then we can, there's an abundance of energy.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:16:35):**  Can you measure how much energy the sun provides?  Can you imagine how much energy there is in the ocean and the tides and the wind?  So there is no shortage of energy.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:16:48):**  We have to be frugal.  We have to use only what we really need and not waste energy.  At the moment, we are too much wasting energy.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:16:56):**  And so in 30 years of time since Chewbacca College started, we have seen a tremendous  transformation of consciousness, tremendous change in people's thinking.  And now our courses at Chewbacca College in gardening, in farming, in holistic science,  
**[0:17:14-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:17:14):**  in ecological design, in ecological and holistic economics, all the courses are being full.  And there are many, many people want to come.  And that's a great change that young people want to go back to nature.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:17:27):**  Young people want to work on the land.  Young people want to grow food.  And it's becoming respectful.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:17:33):**  And there's a good news.  And I would like to encourage your listeners to put their money in land.  The real investment is land.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:17:42):**  If you put your money in the land, that is your much better bank than Barclays Bank or  HSC Bank or any bank of America or any other bank.  The soil is the real bank.  
**[0:17:54-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:17:54):**  So I will encourage your listeners to revere soil and see soil as a real bank, not only  bank for carbon, but even your capital, your money you put in the soil, that money, that  land will last forever.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:18:11):**  And that land will give you food and clothes and houses and trees and animals.  Everything will be looked after.  So real investment in the land and in the soil is a real investment.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:18:23):**  And with this focus on or with this growth of consciousness on climate change, also a  lot of people, let's say, don't take the nature approach.  They go for technology fixes, cellular agriculture, lab grown meat.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:18:38):**  They go really to the, I would almost call it technological utopian.  Like if we just fix a few technology things, we can grow a lot of food inside, et cetera,  et cetera.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:18:48):**  I'm not here to debate that because we do that very often on the podcast, but I would  wonder what do you say when you meet people like that, meet people that are in the city  that are completely disconnected to nature?  
**[0:18:58-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:18:58):**  How do we get them on this journey as well?  How do we get them to see the potential of the biomimicry movement, putting nature in  the center and acknowledging that we are as much part of nature as anything else?  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:19:11):**  How do we get more people to see that potential and to get interested in that instead of going  for the quick fixes in the technology corner that all seem to save us constantly, but never  do?  
**[0:19:22-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:19:22):**  Yes.  So Einstein, the great scientist, he said that you cannot solve the problem with the  same tools and the same mindset which created the problem in the first place.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:19:34):**  So the problems we face today in the world, including climate change, including the diminishing  biodiversity and cultural diversity, and including all the pollution and waste we have today  is created by technology, created by industry, which is run by technology.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:19:52):**  But then they say, if I say that, you cannot fix it.  They say, yeah, but this technology is different.  This time it's different.  
**[0:19:56-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:19:56):**  What do you say when you do a talk or when you did?  Now again, you will hopefully soon, when somebody stands up and we have technology, and what  do you respond to that?  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:20:06):**  Technology has a place, but you must keep it in its place and not allow to think that  technology can solve all your problems.  Our problems are partly technological and solutions are partly technological, but more  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:20:22):**  importantly, our attitude towards nature.  At the moment, we see nature as a resource for the economy.  That attitude has to change.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:20:31):**  Nature is more than a resource for the economy.  Nature is a source of life itself.  We have to think that nature is not just out there.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:20:41):**  The birds, the animals, the mountains, the forest, the rivers, and the oceans.  We are also nature.  We are also made of same elements as forests and mountains and animals are made of.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:20:54):**  We are made of earth, air, fire, water.  We are made of consciousness.  And earth is conscious.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:01):**  Nature is conscious.  Nature is intelligent.  Animals are intelligent.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:04):**  Trees have intelligence.  So we have to change our attitude.  This is a kind of attitude of deep ecology, where we say that nature has intrinsic value.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:15):**  As we recognize the rights of humans, we have to recognize the rights of nature.  Nature also has rights.  Rivers have rights.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:23):**  Forests have rights.  The way we are treating nature at the moment is like war with nature.  The way we are cutting down the rainforest in Amazon and in many other parts of the world  
**[0:21:35-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:35):**  is like war with nature.  And the way we are treating animals in our factory farms in a cruelty way, that is also  war with nature.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:43):**  So we have to make peace with nature.  And so unless we change our attitude, unless we change our worldview, we are not going  to solve problems just by technology.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:52):**  Technology has a place.  But more importantly, our attitude, our values, and our spirituality, and our respect for  nature, and the unity of nature and humans.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:03):**  Humans are nature.  What we do to nature, we do to ourselves.  If we pollute the water, we have to drink it.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:10):**  If we pollute the air, we have to breathe it.  If we pollute the biosphere, atmosphere, we have to live with the global warming and climate  change.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:18):**  What we do to nature, we do to ourselves.  So unless we stop waste and pollution, unless we stop using nature as a resource for the  economy and making more money, more money, more profit, we are not going to solve problems.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:32):**  Technology is not the answer.  Technology can go so far.  But more than that, we have to change our attitude and our relationship with nature.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:39):**  We have to learn to live in humility with nature and in harmony with nature.  And so then I come back to the question, how do we bring people that are not seeing themselves  as part of nature yet?  
**[0:22:50-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:50):**  What in your experience of the last few decades, what is the best way to reconnect people with  nature?  Is it gardening?  
**[0:22:58-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:58):**  Is it walking in nature?  Forest?  What has been the most effective or the best way?  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:01):**  You've seen people that are those light bulbs go off like, oh, I'm actually part of this  system and everything I do, I do to myself.  What has been your experience there?  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:10):**  Well, yes, I mean, your question is very good, because at the moment we feel disconnected  from nature.  And therefore we take nature for granted.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:19):**  But we are not in nature.  We don't go in nature.  So what I would like to say is that, practically speaking, every person should spend at least  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:28):**  few hours a day or two or three days a week in the garden.  When you touch the soil, when you touch the plants, when you touch the seeds, you know  what nature is.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:39):**  And you know the magic of nature.  You know the miracle of nature.  You see nature, one seed of tomato becoming a plant and giving you 100 tomatoes, one seed  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:51):**  of an apple tree giving you 1,000 apples.  That miracle, that magic of nature.  People don't know.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:59):**  People don't understand.  Therefore, being in nature, walking in nature, I would say everybody, whoever you are, how  busy you are, at least one hour, two hours every day, we should walk in nature, in the  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:24:12):**  forest, along the river, among the trees, among the flowers, among the animals, and  watch the birds, and see the butterflies, and see the bees.  Unless you experience nature, you will not value nature.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:24:25):**  Unless you know nature, you will not love nature.  And unless you love nature, you will not protect nature.  So the way to do it is to, whether you are a prime minister, or a corporate leader, or  
**[0:24:35-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:24:35):**  a business leader, or an economist, or a professor, or a queen, or a queen, or whoever you are,  you have to eat.  And if you are eating, you must participate in growing the food.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:24:47):**  Even a prime minister, a president, should have a garden, and they should do some work  in the gardening.  That is the way that we can understand what nature is.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:24:56):**  Nature is miraculous, but we don't know nature.  We know all the signs of Tesco, and BP, and Shell, and Apple, and all the websites we  know, but we don't know the trees, we don't know the animals, we don't know the butterflies,  
**[0:25:11-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:25:11):**  we don't know nature.  So there is a nature deficit disorder in the world.  And therefore, we need to reconnect with nature.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:25:19):**  We have to go out in nature, spend some time in nature.  Don't spend eight hours a day in front of your computer.  Spend eight hours, or two hours, or three hours, or four hours, how much time you can  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:25:31):**  spend out in nature, working in the garden, walking in nature, and writing poetry about  nature, making a picture of nature, making a photograph of nature, painting a beautiful  picture of nature.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:25:43):**  That is the way to reconnect with nature.  And then when we have reconnected, and imagine there's a theater, we're in an old theater,  and the listeners of this podcast are actually live with us, which we hope to do at some  
**[0:25:55-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:25:55):**  point.  We are on stage, and people have done that in the week before.  They have reconnected to nature, but they also bring their professional background.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:26:02):**  They might have worked in companies, they might have set up companies, they might be  investors because they sold companies, et cetera.  So they have resources, either time, experience, and money.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:26:11):**  What would you, of course, we don't give investment advice, but what would you tell them, what  should be next for them?  What should be next after they are reconnected with nature?  
**[0:26:20-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:26:20):**  How should they apply their resources or put their resources to work to regenerate nature  and to reconnect more people potentially with nature?  What would you tell them what would be some interesting places to get started?  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:26:31):**  To regenerate nature, we have to embrace the idea of circular economy.  At the moment, our economy is linear.  We take from nature, use it, and throw it away on the landfills.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:26:45):**  And we are wasting so much natural resources and plastic in the oceans and sewage in the  rivers.  So what we need to do is to invest your capital, your time, your talent, your energy in cyclical  
**[0:27:01-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:27:01):**  or circular economy.  Whatever comes from nature must go back to nature.  Economy of nature is circular, but the industrial economy is linear.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:27:12):**  We have to change industrial economy, which is linear economy, into the economy of nature,  which is a circular economy.  In nature, there is no waste.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:27:21):**  In nature, there is no pollution.  All the trees come from the soil, become the trees, give leaves, give fruit, and go back  to soil.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:27:31):**  And in between, you can eat and you can celebrate.  So circular economy, where everything is going back to nature and there's no waste, zero  waste, and zero pollution.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:27:42):**  If you can invest your capital in zero waste, zero pollution, circular economy, then you  are making good investment for the future.  If you are investing your money, which create waste and pollution and climate change and  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:27:57):**  carbon emission, all that kind of investment is going to bring catastrophe to our children  and grandchildren and many, many future generations to come.  Therefore, wise investment is investment in economy, which is mimicking the nature.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:28:13):**  Nature's economy, economy of nature, is circular economy.  So make that as your teacher.  Nature is your teacher.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:28:23):**  Nature is our mentor.  And if we can learn from nature, and nature has survived for billions of years.  Nature has been here for billions of years.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:28:32):**  For we humans, just in the last three, four hundred years, we have made a mess of the  world.  And therefore, we have to be humble and we have to say that we will learn from nature.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:28:41):**  Nature is our great teacher.  What would you do?  Let's say tomorrow morning you wake up and you are an investment manager, not in a suit  
**[0:28:49-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:28:49):**  in London.  I won't do that to you.  You can stay in your beautiful house, but you have, let's say, a very, very considerable  
**[0:28:56-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:28:56):**  investment amount, let's say a billion pounds.  What would you focus on?  You said land before, which you spend it all on land, which you focus on education, on  
**[0:29:04-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:29:04):**  technology, on food companies, on nature walks.  What would you, if you turned an investor tomorrow morning, what would you?  I don't think any new investment is needed for new technology.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:29:16):**  We have got plenty of investment already in technology.  There is no shortage of technology.  Bill Gates of this world have already made a big mess of this world already with technology.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:29:27):**  So we don't need more investment technology.  I would say either partner with a farmer and invest money so that the produce of the farm  are transformed into food.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:29:39):**  For example, if you are producing grapes, that grape should be transformed on the farm  into wine.  If you are producing milk, that should be transformed into cheese and butter and many  
**[0:29:51-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:29:51):**  other things.  If you are transforming vegetables, transform them.  If you are producing vegetables, transform them into more preserves so that farmers get  
**[0:30:00-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:30:00):**  better income.  At the moment, farmers sell very cheaply to supermarkets.  Supermarkets make a big profit and become rich, and farmers remain poor.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:30:13):**  I think we need to invest money to make farmers better off and live better life and have more  respect and more dignity.  At the moment, the dignity of farming is lost, and we need to bring back that dignity to  
**[0:30:28-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:30:28):**  farming.  I would say if you have capital, if you have money, invest in land, make partnership with  a farmer and make farming food should be a source of joy, a source of celebration, a  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:30:42):**  source of not only food to eat, but also to celebrate.  That is missing at the moment.  The factory farms are so ugly and so much wasteful and so much smelling and a bad smell,  
**[0:30:55-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:30:55):**  and it's bad farming at the moment.  Make farming good farming.  I prefer also small farms.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:02):**  Invest in small farms, 50 acres, 100 acres, 200 acres, not large monolithic in the United  States.  You can farm with 10,000 acres or 20,000 acres.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:12):**  In Australia, maybe you can get even 50,000 or 100,000 acres.  That is a madness in farming.  Farming is to love the land.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:20):**  Farming is to care for the land.  Farming is to respect the land and work with the land.  If you don't put your hands in the soil and don't make your hands dirty, then you are  
**[0:31:30-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:30):**  not a good farmer.  Always remember, dirt is not dirty.  Dirt is sacred.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:37):**  Land and soil is sacred.  All farmers should touch the earth, touch the soil, and look after the animals, and  look after the trees and the forests and plants.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:46):**  That is a true investment.  If you had a magic power to change one thing overnight in the food and agriculture system,  what would that one thing be?  
**[0:31:55-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:55):**  It could be anything.  Global consciousness, taste, no longer CAFOs, anything you can imagine.  What would you change overnight if you had to change one thing?  
**[0:32:05-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:32:05):**  One thing I would like to change is ban all artificial chemical fertilizers from the land.  Because those artificial fertilizers like pesticide and herbicide and all the other  similar things should be totally banned.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:32:22):**  They should be seen as a crime against the soil.  Because soil, the living soil, if you feed people instead of feeding food and good food  and good fruit and good vegetables, if you feed people only with chemicals, human beings  
**[0:32:37-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:32:37):**  are not going to be very happy.  Soil should be fed with good food, good compost.  We have to build the soil with lots of good compost.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:32:48):**  By putting herbicide and pesticide and chemicals and poisonous things into the soil is a crime  against nature, like we are treating humans by feeding them only with chemicals.  Soil is a living soil, and we should always respect that living quality.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:33:03):**  So that's one thing I would like to ban all kinds of chemicals and poisonous herbicide  and pesticide.  The number two I would like to say is that ban all genetic engineering of seeds.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:33:19):**  Because we have to respect the nature.  Nature knows better than all the technological industrialists and the scientists put together.  We need to humble and save our seeds, protect our seeds, and make farmers free to save their  
**[0:33:35-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:33:35):**  seeds so that they can use and reuse and reuse their seeds.  So all genetic engineering of seeds should be banned.  So no chemical pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers, and no genetically engineered  
**[0:33:50-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:33:50):**  seeds.  These are the two things absolutely essential in order to make good farming for the future.  How do we reach, because many poor communities are often also the most degraded, and maybe  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:34:02):**  not even for the last 400 years, but for the last 10,000 years or even more since we started  agriculture or started agriculture a bit more seriously.  How do we reach the poorest and the most degraded communities of this planet, which aren't in  
**[0:34:15-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:34:15):**  the UK where you're now or in the Netherlands where I am?  They're different places.  Is there a role for, let's say, the finance world for investors?  
**[0:34:23-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:34:23):**  What do you see there as you have traveled a lot to reach the poorest?  You know, the communities are degraded because of the history of colonialism, imperialism,  racism, slavery, and industrial exploitation.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:34:41):**  The Western European countries like UK, France, Netherlands, Spain, Italy, all these countries  have been responsible for degrading the countries in Africa and Asia and South America.  The Europeans have gone to South America in Brazil and Mexico and the United States, which  
**[0:35:03-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:35:03):**  is North America and Canada.  We have made a mess with our kind of arrogant thinking that we know better.  We are civilized, and the people there in Africa and Asia are not civilized.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:35:15):**  So we have to go and civilize them.  We have to bring them industry.  We have to bring them technology of the kind which they don't know.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:35:22):**  So that way, we have degraded and then deprived many, many small rural communities.  And they have lost their value of land.  They have lost the value of food.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:35:34):**  They have lost the skills to make clothes, to build houses.  So poor are poor not because they are stupid.  Poor are poor because the powerful and rich nations have exploited them, suppressed them,  
**[0:35:47-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:35:47):**  ignored them.  Therefore, we need to give them freedom and the land so they can grow their food, they  can build their houses, they can make their clothes, they can make their shoes, they can  
**[0:35:56-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:35:56):**  make their furniture, they can live a good life.  But they have the two hands.  They have a tradition.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:01):**  They have a culture.  They have intelligence.  They have everything.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:04):**  Poor are poor not because of themselves.  Poor are poor because of us, the very rich in the Western world.  And so what would you say to investors or also people, entrepreneurs that are starting  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:15):**  companies or wanting to start companies in these more degraded areas, in the poorer places?  Because that's where most impact can be made.  That's where the potential of impacting as many lives as possible and impact as much  
**[0:36:27-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:27):**  soil as possible is potentially the greatest.  How do we approach that without making the same mistakes as we've made in the past?  And we're still making because we're still trying to push technology.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:35):**  We're still trying to push.  We know better.  Let's educate, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:39):**  How do we approach that differently to make sure we don't make that mistake?  Because we can bring something in some cases, some resources, some experience, some money,  obviously, or processing or markets that are interested in the coffee, the cacao and a  
**[0:36:50-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:50):**  lot of products from there.  How do we approach that differently to make sure we don't fall in the same trap?  First of all, when we invest money in poor countries like India or Africa or many other  
**[0:37:02-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:37:02):**  countries, we have to say the people who are living in the villages, they should remain  in the villages.  Villages are very beautiful, part of nature.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:37:13):**  Villages surrounded by trees and birds and lakes and rivers and beauty and serenity.  Just the idea that we all need to be brought into industrial system of urbanized and roads  and cars and kind of aeroplanes and airports and seaports and all that kind of infrastructure  
**[0:37:35-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:37:35):**  is not necessary.  Villages are very beautiful.  They have integrity.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:37:40):**  They are natural and they have less impact on nature and they are frugal.  Therefore, that village culture, the rural culture and the rural reconstruction should  be maintained.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:37:50):**  Number two, when you are going into third world countries like Africa or Asia, do not  think that you know better.  Give them land.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:37:59):**  If the poor people have no land, give them some help to buy the land or have the land  so that they have land.  If you have land, that will give you work.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:38:10):**  Land will give you employment.  Land will give you jobs.  Land will give you food.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:38:15):**  Land will give you trees and fruit and herbs.  Land will give you houses.  Land is the source of life.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:38:22):**  If you can help people to have land, that is one thing, good investment.  Then of course, when they are producing food and so on, they can share back something to  the investors.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:38:34):**  I have no difficulty.  Five percent, 10 percent of their produce can be given back to the investors.  The 80 to 90 percent of investment should benefit the local people who are being helped.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:38:47):**  The land is the best investment.  That is what I would say.  Let the farmers and the laborers and the workers in the rural areas develop their own culture  
**[0:38:58-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:38:58):**  and develop their own wisdom.  You do not have to export wisdom, which is not really so much wisdom, from the Western  countries and industrial technological paradigm.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:39:08):**  We do not need it.  Rural paradigm with agriculture, agro-economy and agricultural culture.  Agriculture, that is a real culture.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:39:17):**  We have to be humble.  The Western people who are investing money in poorer countries, they have to be humble  and they have to respect the poor.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:39:25):**  The poor have wisdom more than we, the rich, think they have.  We need to respect them.  I want to ask a final question, it never is.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:39:35):**  At Schumacher College, seeing this movement, you have traveled the world, you have walked  the world, what has been the biggest surprise over the last 30, 40, 50 years?  What makes you wake up in the morning with so much energy, which radiates through the  
**[0:39:52-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:39:52):**  screen?  I can see the video, people can only hear the audio, but I would definitely encourage  people to watch some talks, etc.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:39:58):**  What keeps you so energetic and what has been that surprise or that flame of energy that  keeps you going?  What keeps me going is the young people.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:40:07):**  I'm amazed at how increasing number of young people are waking up.  Is it really that different from 20, 30 years ago?  Because I live in my bubble, but you've seen that difference, you've seen that growth.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:40:20):**  Yes, I see the difference.  The greater Thunberg generation is something amazing.  There are hundreds of thousands of young boys and girls around the world are marching for  
**[0:40:32-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:40:32):**  climate change and climate sustainability and ecology and regenerative agriculture.  Hundreds of thousands of young people in India, in China, in Africa, in America, in Europe,  everywhere, this is a great new development.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:40:47):**  At Schumacher College, young people are coming to learn gardening.  Young people are coming to learn how to live in harmony with nature.  They don't want PhD for their personal success.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:40:58):**  This change among the younger generation gives me tremendous hope.  I'm 85 years old.  When I see young people coming up to me and saying that we want to learn about how to  
**[0:41:09-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:41:09):**  grow food and how to live simple life, and they are buying my book, Elegant Simplicity,  and they are buying my book, Pilgrimage for Peace, and they want to say, we want to do  something like you did when you were young.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:41:20):**  That is a great change.  That gives me hope.  The young people are giving me the energy, which I have, the passion, which I have, and  
**[0:41:28-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:41:28):**  the enthusiasm, which I have, and the hope, which I have.  So it's the young people who are the hope for the future.  I cannot imagine a better end of this conversation.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:41:37):**  I hope that it's not the last one.  I know we have to be conscious of time.  You have a very busy schedule and I'm very much looking forward to checking in what's  
**[0:41:46-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:41:46):**  happening at Schumacher, what's happening with the land there, and what's happening  in general in your life.  So thank you so much Satish for your time today and wishing you a wonderful rest of

**[0:42:58-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:42:58):**  Why are we doing this course?  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  to work in regenerating soils and have been following this space since 2011 and recording  
**[0:43:08-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:43:08):**  this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in this space over the last years?  How have we built our decision making framework, what to focus on with the podcast, how have  
**[0:43:21-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:43:21):**  we picked interviewees, what questions should you ask, what is happening in this space,  what should you read, what should you listen, what should you watch, how to approach this  space.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:43:32):**  For whom is this course?  You, the soil builders and investors in this space.  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  
**[0:43:41-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:43:41):**  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management, consultants, etc.  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:43:53):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:44:06):**  Is this course free?  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:44:10):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with very different means.  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:44:25-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:44:25):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  So what is this course?  
**[0:44:30-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:44:30):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  so you don't have to write along.  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:44:43-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:44:43):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:44:55):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're gonna look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:45:08):**  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:45:14):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:45:25):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.  Click on the link below, sign up and I'm really looking forward to your feedback.

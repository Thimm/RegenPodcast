**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  
**[0:00:05-0:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:00:05):**  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com slash course, or in the links below.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:00:14):**  We obviously talk a lot about food on this podcast, but there are other industries that  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:00:18):**  source from the land and have massive environmental challenges and regenerative opportunities.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:00:23):**  For instance, the fashion industry and specifically the luxury fashion industry, and specifically  
**[0:00:28-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:00:28):**  within that, the luxury leather industry.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:00:30):**  Today we'll learn what it takes to make a luxury shoe made with materials sourced from  
**[0:00:35-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:00:35):**  farms using regenerative practices.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:00:38):**  So many relevant lessons for the regenerative food movement.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:00:41):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:00:44):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:48-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:00:48):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:00:50):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:00:54):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work, to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:00:59):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:01:04):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:01:06):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:10-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:01:10):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:01:13):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:01:18):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:01:22):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:26-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:01:26):**  our work.

**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:01:29):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q and A webinars with former

**[0:01:46-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:01:46):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:01:48):**  Welcome to a very special episode because for the first time we step outside the world  
**[0:01:52-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:01:52):**  of food and agriculture and we go into the world of fashion.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:01:55):**  And today we have the founder and co-CEO of Koio, creating sustainable luxury footwear.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:02:00):**  And they're about to launch or when you're listening to this have already soft launched,  
**[0:02:04-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:02:04):**  let's say a regenerative shoe.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:02:06):**  So welcome Johannes, I'm so much looking forward to unpacking this.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:02:09):**  Yeah, excited to be here.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:02:11):**  Thank you for having me, Colin.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:02:12):**  And I mean, unpacking, when I said it, it's definitely wasn't intended as a pun, but we  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:02:16):**  could do, I mean, we're not using video, but we could almost do this unboxing of a shoebox.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:02:21):**  But I want to start with a question, not necessarily why soil because we'll get to that in a minute.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:02:27):**  That's usually my opening question.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:02:28):**  But in this case, how did you end up founding sustainable luxury footwear company?  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:02:34):**  Because you don't really come from a shoe shoe family, let's say I think.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:02:37):**  Yeah, that's very true.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:02:38):**  I started Koio during business school with my friend Chris.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:02:42):**  We both did our MBA at Wharton.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:02:45):**  We're both German and Wharton is a place where a lot of digitally native brands originated  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:02:50):**  from Warby Parker is probably one of the most well known.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:02:55):**  And they had already launched when we arrived there in 2013.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:03:00):**  So Chris and I are originally from Germany.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:03:03):**  We both have a business background.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:03:04):**  I used to work as a consultant at McKinsey and Chris was an investment banker at JP Morgan.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:03:11):**  But when we arrived at Wharton, the fascination that immediately caught us was around this  
**[0:03:17-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:03:17):**  business model of a direct to consumer brand.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:03:20):**  And at the same time, we were passionate about nicely designed sneakers.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:03:26):**  We hadn't known each other in Europe, but we both had this fascination around, well,  
**[0:03:31-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:03:31):**  nice Italian leather sneakers.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:03:33):**  And during our first jobs, we regularly saved up and afforded a pair every once in a while.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:03:40):**  And as we learned more about direct to consumer, when we were in Philly, we brought this direct  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:03:47):**  to consumer business model together with high end footwear and realized that many traditional  
**[0:03:53-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:03:53):**  luxury brands were going to be disrupted by direct to consumer and digitally native brands  
**[0:03:59-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:03:59):**  at some point.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:04:01):**  So we wanted to be one of the companies that are disrupting.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:04:06):**  So we founded Koyo and did that really as a project during business school.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:04:12):**  We even used some courses to work on it.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:04:15):**  But then after graduating, we decided to actually make it a real thing and move to New York  
**[0:04:21-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:04:21):**  and build the company from there.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:04:24):**  And I mean, I think many people that go to business school, I think because I don't know,  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:04:28):**  I never did, but start a project like this on the side or sort of started, I wouldn't  
**[0:04:33-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:04:33):**  say fakely, but it doesn't really turn into you.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:04:35):**  You're not going to ship real shoes because there's a big difference between writing that  
**[0:04:39-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:04:39):**  business plan and doing the calculations and the models and all of that.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:04:42):**  And so what triggered it to actually saying, okay, we're going to actually turn this into  
**[0:04:47-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:04:47):**  a company and do this for the next X years?  
**[0:04:50-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:04:50):**  Was there a moment?  
**[0:04:51-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:04:51):**  Was there a decision?  
**[0:04:52-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:04:52):**  Was there a few beers involved?  
**[0:04:53-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:04:53):**  Like what happened there to make you to actually do that?  
**[0:04:56-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:04:56):**  There was definitely a moment, maybe a few moments that made us take this very seriously  
**[0:05:02-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:05:02):**  and make it into a real business.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:05:04):**  If I think about it, it was probably the summer between the first and second year of our MBA.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:05:10):**  That was when Chris and I dedicated a few months to the project.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:05:14):**  It was the first time that we went to New York.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:05:16):**  We then designed our first shoe, met with professors from New York's design universities  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:05:22):**  like Parsons and FIT to learn about shoe making and design.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:05:27):**  Definitely the areas that we had to catch up on the most.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:05:31):**  And it was a very special feeling when we held our first paper design of a shoe in hand  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:05:39):**  in the middle of this period, in the middle of the summer.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:05:43):**  It made it much more tangible and got us much more invested in this project.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:05:48):**  And then towards the end of that summer, the most important thing happened.  
**[0:05:52-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:05:52):**  We decided to go to Italy to find a manufacturer and spend weeks in the country looking for  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:06:00):**  the right partner to make our shoes.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:06:03):**  Knocked on doors, visited over 30 factories and initially already got fairly lucky and  
**[0:06:10-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:06:10):**  got some high-end manufacturers.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:06:12):**  We found a Louis Vuitton manufacturer.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:06:14):**  We found a manufacturer for common projects, which is a brand that's quite popular in the  
**[0:06:19-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:06:19):**  US.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:06:20):**  It was at the end, however, that we actually found our dream factory, which was a Chanel  
**[0:06:27-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:06:27):**  factory.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:06:28):**  So, they were producing shoes for Chanel, but also for Saint Laurent and Golden Goose.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:06:34):**  And they agreed to work with us and agreed to do our first batch.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:06:38):**  So, at the end of that summer, we had a partner that could not have been better in terms of  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:06:45):**  the quality, in terms of the designs they were able to realize.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:06:50):**  And we had committed to doing 300 pairs as a first batch.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:06:53):**  So, we were kind of in it.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:06:56):**  So, we got the shoes then in early 2015, right around when we were about to graduate and  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:07:04):**  organized a pop-up in New York, where we sold those shoes for the first time.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:07:10):**  And we invited all our friends from business school, but also stopped people on the street  
**[0:07:15-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:07:15):**  and kind of forced them to go into our store.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:07:18):**  And people gave us really good feedback.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:07:20):**  The shoes looked beautiful.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:07:21):**  The manufacturer had done an amazing job interpreting our design and turning it into really, really  
**[0:07:27-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:07:27):**  high quality shoes.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:07:29):**  And people bought the shoes.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:07:30):**  So we realized, hey, we're probably onto something.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:07:33):**  How difficult is it to sell shoes online, like a digital native brand, as you mentioned,  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:07:38):**  we've seen examples on glasses, which I think is very tricky as well.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:07:43):**  Metresses obviously, and many other things, shaving and all of that.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:07:47):**  Clothing obviously has exploded as well, but shoes have seemed always to, wouldn't seem  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:07:51):**  to escape that, but it's, I think for many people, a tricky thing.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:07:55):**  Like, how do you approach that?  
**[0:07:57-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:07:57):**  And don't worry, listeners, we're going to get to the regenerative part very soon, but  
**[0:07:59-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:07:59):**  I'm very curious, how do you sell shoes online actually?  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:08:01):**  Yeah, there are a lot of learnings for us over the years.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:08:05):**  It is just making the whole process very easy for anyone who goes through the buying process.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:08:14):**  Starts with being very present on all the channels where people might get to know brands  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:08:20):**  like Instagram, Facebook, definitely just getting your name out there and creating awareness  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:08:25):**  for the brand.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:08:27):**  But then as soon as people get to your website, it's clear pictures, a clear user flow, showing  
**[0:08:34-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:08:34):**  reviews that are authentic and offering things like free shipping, free returns, having a  
**[0:08:42-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:08:42):**  size finder on the website that allows people to enter their regular shoe size or like foot  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:08:49):**  measurements, and then determine a coil size.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:08:53):**  All the way to doing more exotic things like try before you buy a program where people  
**[0:08:59-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:08:59):**  leave their credit card information, but they don't have to pay their shoes yet.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:09:02):**  They get them shipped and then they can try them on.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:09:05):**  And if they like them, they keep them and will be charged.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:09:08):**  If not, they can send them back and will never be charged.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:09:10):**  So it's really very multifaceted and there's always new stuff happening and innovation  
**[0:09:17-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:09:17):**  being integrated.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:09:19):**  But yeah, it's quite the learning curve for sure.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:09:22):**  I think it's very interesting in terms of really reducing any potential barrier, like  
**[0:09:27-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:09:27):**  real or imaginary to get people to try them, to get people to actually.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:09:33):**  And I think the food industry probably as we're massive amount is moving online at the  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:09:37):**  moment, we can learn a lot from that and how to get that first sale in and how to start  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:09:41):**  building that relationship and making sure that direct to consumer relationship, which  
**[0:09:47-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:09:47):**  can be absolutely crucial.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:09:48):**  We've seen it in examples we had here on the podcast, Lavialla in Italy is one example,  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:09:53):**  but many others like to capture that full margin is an incredible amount of work.  
**[0:09:57-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:09:57):**  Like let's not underestimate that.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:09:59):**  But if you're able to do it, it's also an incredible opportunity and really puts you  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:10:03):**  in a position for very interesting growth or very interesting future potential because  
**[0:10:08-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:10:08):**  you're not so dependent on the retailers, et cetera.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:10:11):**  But then COVID hit and you were, I think at that time, still a mix of shoe shops and retailers  
**[0:10:18-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:10:18):**  and online.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:10:19):**  And what happened when the pandemic hit?  
**[0:10:21-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:10:21):**  Yeah, the pandemic was obviously a big shock to the system.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:10:25):**  We are making shoes for social situations and that include going for dinners with friends,  
**[0:10:32-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:10:32):**  traveling, going on dates.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:10:33):**  And suddenly from one day to the other, none of these happened anymore.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:10:37):**  It was a challenge and we faced it head on and got through it in a very healthy way.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:10:44):**  Unfortunately, what happened for us during the pandemic was we saw a massive shift from  
**[0:10:50-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:10:50):**  physical retail to online.  
**[0:10:53-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:10:53):**  Before the pandemic, we had retail stores in New York, LA, San Francisco, Miami, and  
**[0:11:00-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:11:00):**  suddenly from one day to the other, nobody was buying there anymore.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:11:03):**  We refocused very much on online.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:11:07):**  During the pandemic, also refocused on two stores.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:11:10):**  So now we still have New York and LA and online is by far now our dominant channel.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:11:17):**  So yeah, if you look at 2019, our sales were pretty much still almost 60% online, 40% retail.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:11:28):**  If you look at our direct channels and by now it's a big majority online.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:11:34):**  So yeah, of our direct channels, about 80% are online, 20% retail.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:11:39):**  Wow.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:11:40):**  That's a shift that probably sounds similar to some food and agriculture players during  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:11:45):**  the last two years, because it's almost two years we're in this, in this mess.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:11:50):**  And so in terms of sustainability and then regeneration, obviously, where did that journey  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:11:56):**  start?  
**[0:11:57-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:11:57):**  What was, were there any triggers?  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:11:58):**  Was it from the onset, the goal to really push the limits as you're doing now, or was  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:12:03):**  it something that grew into the company slowly or maybe more strongly?  
**[0:12:07-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:12:07):**  What were the triggers there?  
**[0:12:09-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:12:09):**  It really happened in three phases from the beginning of Koyo till now.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:12:15):**  And at the beginning, when we started the brand, Chris and I were convinced that we  
**[0:12:22-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:12:22):**  wanted to make a high-end product.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:12:24):**  And given that we wanted to make a high-end product, we wanted to make it not only nice  
**[0:12:30-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:12:30):**  and shiny and beautiful at the surface.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:12:32):**  We also wanted to make it really healthy at the core.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:12:36):**  And healthy at the core meant to us that we are complying with our ideas around sustainability.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:12:45):**  So in phase one, right at the beginning of Koyo, we decided to make high-end leather  
**[0:12:53-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:12:53):**  shoes.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:12:54):**  And to us, that was a sustainability activity because these shoes you can wear for years.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:13:01):**  And the longer you wear the product, the less waste you create.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:13:04):**  So that was a very important element for us.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:13:07):**  Secondly, we decided to make them in a country where generally labor standards are high,  
**[0:13:14-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:13:14):**  industrial standards are high.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:13:16):**  So we chose Italy as a place to manufacture the shoes over emerging markets where some  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:13:22):**  of these standards are not as well managed.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:13:26):**  That was the first phase.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:13:27):**  So very basic.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:13:29):**  We just focused on very high quality and producing in a high standard country at a very high  
**[0:13:35-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:13:35):**  quality manufacturer.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:13:37):**  And then over the first two years, we got really interested in materials and wanted  
**[0:13:44-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:13:44):**  to improve our material sourcing and make that more environmentally sustainable.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:13:51):**  And it coincided with a lot of innovation around sustainability from the supplier side.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:13:57):**  So the leather manufacturers, the sole manufacturers, they all realized, hey, we can't ignore the  
**[0:14:02-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:14:02):**  sustainability trend.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:14:03):**  We really need to do something.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:14:05):**  So when you went to the leather fair in Milan, like MECAM, sorry, Lineapella, that's a leather  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:14:11):**  fair, you saw a lot of innovation.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:14:15):**  But what frustrated us when we did our first rounds of research and talked to suppliers  
**[0:14:20-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:14:20):**  was that many of these solutions were quite insular.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:14:25):**  So the innovations were, for example, vegan leathers, which we thought at first glance  
**[0:14:33-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:14:33):**  are great.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:14:34):**  And we got really interested.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:14:36):**  But then as we looked into them, we heard they're actually just plastic.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:14:41):**  And another innovation was recycled leather, which is ground up leather that's then made  
**[0:14:47-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:14:47):**  into recycled leather.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:14:50):**  Also super excited at first.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:14:51):**  And then we learned in order to make this recycled leather, you need to add a bunch  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:14:55):**  of chemicals and also plastic coatings.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:14:59):**  So for all of these quote unquote solutions, you're really only replacing one problem with  
**[0:15:06-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:15:06):**  another problem.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:15:07):**  And that's what we found extremely frustrating as we did our research.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:15:12):**  What we did end up doing in this phase two was we picked the materials that we found  
**[0:15:18-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:15:18):**  best in the current offering.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:15:20):**  So for leathers, we picked leather working group certified leathers, which mean that  
**[0:15:26-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:15:26):**  the leathers are manufactured with very high standards in terms of waste management, chemicals  
**[0:15:32-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:15:32):**  management, water management, etc.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:15:34):**  Because what are the issues with leather?  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:15:36):**  I mean, apart from the animal side of things where we'll get to, but I think some people  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:15:41):**  know, but just to paint the picture, what are the main issues with the leather industry  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:15:46):**  in terms of I mean, you mentioned waste, water and chemicals?  
**[0:15:49-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:15:49):**  How bad is it?  
**[0:15:50-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:15:50):**  Yeah, I mean, it can be really bad.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:15:52):**  It really depends on who's making the leather.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:15:54):**  And that's why it's so important to know exactly who your suppliers are.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:15:59):**  If you look at the worst kind, like in some countries, leather is sourced from meat farms  
**[0:16:07-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:16:07):**  that hold these animals in inhumane ways.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:16:13):**  And then it's tanned with toxic tannins like chrome six, that are carcinogenic, and pose  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:16:21):**  massive problems for people who work with this leather, but anyone also lives near the  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:16:26):**  tannery all the way to the environment and people who wear the leather afterwards.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:16:31):**  But that's really the most extreme case.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:16:34):**  If you look at like Italian tannery, the problem with leather is that it's well, it again,  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:16:41):**  it's sourced probably from cows that are held fairly, like pretty much in captivity as part  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:16:45):**  of the meat industry.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:16:47):**  So it's sometimes cows that are raised under questionable conditions.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:16:52):**  And then you need a lot of chemicals to make this leather.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:16:57):**  There are some 18 steps that you need to go through in order to turn a cowhide into actual  
**[0:17:03-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:17:03):**  leather, starting with salting and drying the hide, then removing all like fat and hair  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:17:10):**  and then starting pre-tanning and then tanning, then the dying.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:17:14):**  There's often plastic coatings that are applied to the leather.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:17:18):**  So yeah, a lot of steps and each of them has a bunch of chemicals that are included.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:17:25):**  So it's very, very important to know exactly who you're working with and making sure that  
**[0:17:30-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:17:30):**  a tannery you work with is very considerate about chemical use and only uses the best  
**[0:17:36-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:17:36):**  ingredients in order to make the leather.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:17:39):**  And then, I mean, you mentioned something fascinating I never thought about.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:17:42):**  Let's say the worst possible case, like are there actually cases of people getting sick  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:17:47):**  because they wear something that has been treated very badly?  
**[0:17:52-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:17:52):**  Are there, because you mentioned even for the people that wear, of course, for the people  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:17:54):**  that have to work with it and that live nearby, et cetera, but all the way down to the end  
**[0:17:59-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:17:59):**  consumer.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:18:00):**  Oh yeah.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:18:01):**  Wow.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:18:02):**  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:18:03):**  There's a big problem in India, for example, that tanning often takes place with this toxic  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:18:10):**  chrome six and it stays in the leather and it's, yeah, it's really bad.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:18:15):**  I mean, it's, yeah, it's released the skin.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:18:19):**  Exactly.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:18:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:18:21):**  No, it's very important as a customer to know that you're wearing high quality leather.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:18:25):**  And so in the best case, like what's the highest standard you can get to now in terms of chemical  
**[0:18:31-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:18:31):**  use?  
**[0:18:32-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:18:32):**  Is it no danger chemicals or is it very minimum amount?  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:18:35):**  What's the ideal situation currently that you can actually work with as a company like  
**[0:18:39-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:18:39):**  yourself?  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:18:40):**  And then we get to what's the ideal future scenario, but what's the best case scenario  
**[0:18:44-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:18:44):**  you can get to now?  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:18:45):**  What's important to know is that if you are wearing leather that's produced in Italy,  
**[0:18:51-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:18:51):**  you can assume that it fulfills the most important standards in terms of chemical use.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:18:58):**  So chrome tanning is the most commercialized tanning method.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:19:03):**  And so one that's used in Italy the most and what high quality tanneries do is they only  
**[0:19:12-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:19:12):**  use Chrome three, which is a different state of the Chrome and which is not toxic or anything  
**[0:19:20-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:19:20):**  like that.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:19:21):**  It is relatively tricky to maintain Chrome three and not have it turn into Chrome six.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:19:26):**  That's why the industrial processes need to be very well managed, but it's also very doable  
**[0:19:32-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:19:32):**  and Italian tanneries do that.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:19:34):**  So that's important to know.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:19:36):**  Like if you get high quality leather, then there shouldn't be any concerns around health.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:19:41):**  Now there's a lot of innovation happening in tanning.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:19:46):**  People want to move away from Chrome, not only because of the risk of having it turn  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:19:51):**  into Chrome six, but also because some people might be allergic to Chrome or just don't  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:19:56):**  want to have any metals in the leather.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:20:00):**  And therefore there are different tanning agents being developed.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:20:04):**  A really promising one is one called zeolite.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:20:09):**  It's a tanning agent that is Chrome free, that's aldehyde free and where the leather  
**[0:20:15-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:20:15):**  can actually biodegrade.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:20:17):**  So extremely promising and one that we're already working with.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:20:21):**  And then there's also always the super traditional vegetable tanning method, which is probably  
**[0:20:28-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:20:28):**  thousands of years old and probably the first tanning method ever where you really use fruits  
**[0:20:35-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:20:35):**  or barks that contain tannins and use them to tan the leather.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:20:41):**  Some of the shoes that we're doing use this vegetable tanning method.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:20:45):**  The difference between something like zeolite and vegetable tanning is that with zeolite,  
**[0:20:50-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:20:50):**  you can create actual white leather and then make it any color you want.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:20:57):**  Also the leather is very soft and malleable.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:21:01):**  Vegetable tanning only creates these classic crunchy leather colors, like the chestnut  
**[0:21:08-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:21:08):**  colors, the darker colors.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:21:10):**  You can't achieve a true white with vegetable tanning.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:21:13):**  And it's also always a bit harder, so it takes a bit longer for the leather to get soft as  
**[0:21:18-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:21:18):**  you wear it in.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:21:19):**  And so, I mean, now we go deep into materials, but I think we were still in phase two.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:21:24):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:21:25):**  We were still in phase two.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:21:26):**  And perfectly fine to go down this rabbit hole because I'm extremely interested.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:21:29):**  Never thought about leather at this level.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:21:32):**  But what triggered stage three, basically?  
**[0:21:35-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:21:35):**  Stage three was triggered because we were still not happy with stage two.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:21:41):**  We were obviously excited that we had found these materials like leather working, group  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:21:45):**  leather or recycled rubber or natural rubber to use in our outsold.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:21:50):**  But we felt like all of these activities were going in different directions and there was  
**[0:21:56-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:21:56):**  no holistic umbrella or vision that united it all and made us go into one direction.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:22:06):**  And in the search for this vision, we talked with investors in Koyo and people close to  
**[0:22:14-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:22:14):**  our brand.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:22:15):**  And it just so happened that one of our biggest investors Acton Capital and Jan Schulze, who's  
**[0:22:21-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:22:21):**  on our board.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:22:23):**  Shout out to Jan.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:22:25):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:22:26):**  Is a thought leader in regenerative agriculture and has invested a lot of time and effort  
**[0:22:33-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:22:33):**  in promoting this very interesting development.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:22:39):**  And as we started talking more about regenerative agriculture, we suddenly started seeing the  
**[0:22:44-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:22:44):**  link between regenerative agriculture and our product.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:22:50):**  And the link was cows.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:22:52):**  Cows play such an important role in regenerative agriculture with their potential to heal soil  
**[0:22:59-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:22:59):**  and build up organic matter and build up healthy soil that we started thinking about ways to  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:23:06):**  bring this holistic vision of regenerative agriculture into Koyo.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:23:11):**  And as we started exploring this topic, we realized that, hey, we can actually create  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:23:19):**  a product that sources leather from regenerative farming.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:23:24):**  And we can very likely also source other elements of the shoe from regenerative farming, the  
**[0:23:32-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:23:32):**  sole, the laces, and therefore make a shoe that is completely sourced from regenerative  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:23:39):**  farms, which made suddenly all our activities converge.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:23:45):**  And that's when we realized, hey, this is the holistic approach that we were looking  
**[0:23:50-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:23:50):**  for.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:23:51):**  This is our vision that has a dramatic and positive impact on our ecosystems and our  
**[0:23:58-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:23:58):**  planet.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:23:59):**  And where as deep as you dig, you only see that it makes more sense and it's reinforcing.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:24:07):**  It was a dramatic difference to all the other things that we had seen in the market before,  
**[0:24:13-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:24:13):**  like vegan leather or recycled leather, which were also insular and not systemic at all.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:24:19):**  So yeah, it was that moment when we got really excited and started down the path of regenerative  
**[0:24:25-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:24:25):**  agriculture.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:24:27):**  And it sounds easy on paper in theory, like, oh, let's build a regenerative shoe and we're  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:24:31):**  going to do the regenerative sole and the laces and of course the leather and then reality  
**[0:24:35-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:24:35):**  hit.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:24:36):**  So you've launched or soft launched the shoe as we're putting this online.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:24:41):**  And where are you at now?  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:24:42):**  I mean, a regenerative shoe, I don't think it existed yet or it exists even in general.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:24:47):**  Like what's the current status of the shoe?  
**[0:24:49-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:24:49):**  Where are you?  
**[0:24:50-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:24:50):**  And then we're going to talk obviously where you would like to go.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:24:53):**  Yeah, indeed.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:24:54):**  We are launching the first regenerative luxury shoe, which is really incredible achievement.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:25:00):**  And we're super proud of everyone at Koyo that we executed this together so quickly.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:25:07):**  It was really less than a year of like setting all this up, a really quick turnaround.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:25:12):**  And it's really challenging, like you say, just looking at the leather, which is the  
**[0:25:18-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:25:18):**  main component of the shoe and also the one that's regenerative in this current version.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:25:23):**  If you look at how conventional leather is made, it's part of the massive meat industry.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:25:31):**  And in the meat industry, millions of cow hides are collected and go through the leather  
**[0:25:37-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:25:37):**  making process.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:25:38):**  It's very industrialized and it's highly specialized companies that take over a very specific step  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:25:47):**  in the leather production.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:25:49):**  For example, there are tanneries that only work with the height of the shoulders.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:25:56):**  And what they do is because there's millions of cow hides, they procure a selection of  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:26:01):**  cow hides that are virtually identical to one another.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:26:06):**  They just select the ones that are all looking the same and are exactly...  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:26:10):**  I can hear an issue coming up when the cows are outside and have gone through managed  
**[0:26:14-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:26:14):**  grazing and all this.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:26:17):**  I can imagine they're not all the same.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:26:19):**  So what did the tanner say when you showed up with this idea of, let's say, adding some  
**[0:26:25-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:26:25):**  personality to the hides?  
**[0:26:26-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:26:26):**  Exactly.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:26:27):**  You're pointing at the heart of the challenge.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:26:29):**  They told us it's a great idea, but then they went radio silent.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:26:34):**  So we kicked it off talking to all our current Italian suppliers, which do very high quality  
**[0:26:40-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:26:40):**  leather and are not always the big ones.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:26:43):**  There are also some more artisan style smaller ones, but even those were already so specialized  
**[0:26:49-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:26:49):**  that they only work with certain parts of the skin.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:26:52):**  They require big amounts of hides because they have massive tanning drums that they  
**[0:26:58-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:26:58):**  need to fill.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:26:59):**  It really sounds like processing of meat in general or the food industry are very specialized  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:27:04):**  on a specific vertical or specific part of the vertical, of the vertical and saying,  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:27:09):**  yeah, it would be great to do different sized pumpkins, but we need them all the same because  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:27:13):**  otherwise we just cannot cook the soup or we cannot do that because the machines are  
**[0:27:17-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:27:17):**  made for tomatoes that are always exactly the same at exactly the same moment, etc.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:27:22):**  And so what did you do?  
**[0:27:24-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:27:24):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:27:25):**  So yeah, we had to rethink the supply chain and basically had to build our own supply  
**[0:27:30-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:27:30):**  chain.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:27:31):**  And there were a few challenges.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:27:33):**  The biggest challenge was the supply of regenerative leather super scars.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:27:39):**  So there is, as you know, there are not many regenerative farms yet.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:27:44):**  It's very much a growing phenomenon.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:27:48):**  And because there's not many, there's no industrial system set up to collect hides, to select  
**[0:27:54-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:27:54):**  the ones that have a certain quality.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:27:57):**  So we had to really rethink the whole process.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:28:01):**  We basically accepted that we'd have to work with whatever cowhide we're getting.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:28:09):**  Let me actually backtrack a little bit.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:28:11):**  We needed to find a place where a solid amount of cow hides that are sourced regeneratively  
**[0:28:19-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:28:19):**  are coming together, and we identified an abattoir in Switzerland that only procures  
**[0:28:28-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:28:28):**  cows from farms that are biodynamic regenerative or fulfilled like all of these standards.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:28:36):**  So for us, this abattoir became the key relationship.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:28:40):**  It produces about 10 hides per week, which equates about 100 pairs of shoes per week.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:28:48):**  And there we are basically getting all our hides from.  
**[0:28:53-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:28:53):**  And then these hides go from the abattoir to a hide dealer in Switzerland.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:29:00):**  They need to be removed from the abattoir for sanitary reasons and regulatory reasons  
**[0:29:05-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:29:05):**  very quickly.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:29:06):**  So the hide dealer is the one that takes the hides and salts them and dries them so that  
**[0:29:10-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:29:10):**  they can be transported.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:29:12):**  And then the next challenge was to find a tannery that can work with these non-industrial  
**[0:29:18-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:29:18):**  hides.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:29:19):**  Because they're 10 hides, but they're all different for sure.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:29:22):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:29:23):**  They're all different.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:29:24):**  I mean, yeah, the cows that we're getting the hides from, they're actually the cows  
**[0:29:27-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:29:27):**  that are on alpine pastures all summer long and are maintaining the alpine ecosystem by  
**[0:29:36-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:29:36):**  grazing and preventing overforestation.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:29:39):**  And yeah, you can imagine cows that are around on the mountains all summer, they have scratches  
**[0:29:44-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:29:44):**  and scars and pigmentation.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:29:47):**  Does it mean that the shoes are going to get more personality?  
**[0:29:50-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:29:50):**  They're not going to be all the same?  
**[0:29:51-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:29:51):**  And is that for you a challenge and potential opportunity to sell that story?  
**[0:29:55-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:29:55):**  Like, look, if your shoes are all the same, they probably come from this place, aka a  
**[0:30:00-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:30:00):**  CAFO.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:30:01):**  If your shoes are not all the same, it meant maybe the cow had a story.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:30:04):**  Exactly.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:30:05):**  So, to have a unique, beautiful, natural material is one that we 100% want to tell.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:30:11):**  And that adds a lot of personality and interest and value to the shoe.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:30:17):**  And so then this hide dealer that I never knew that was a thing, picks it up, and then  
**[0:30:21-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:30:21):**  you have to find this tanning.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:30:23):**  And that must have been a few knocking on a few doors as well, someone that can process  
**[0:30:28-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:30:28):**  only 10 hides, because it sounds like that's not a lot.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:30:30):**  And then even very different ones and getting to sort of a standard that you can send to  
**[0:30:36-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:30:36):**  your shoemaker in Italy.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:30:37):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:30:39):**  It was quite a challenge to find someone to tan these hides.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:30:42):**  We did have great support from people who are in the leather industry and are also very  
**[0:30:47-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:30:47):**  forward thinking around more sustainable methods.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:30:51):**  Eventually, we found this tannery in Germany that can produce in small batches.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:30:59):**  And that also has very high standards in terms of what inputs they use and in general, what  
**[0:31:06-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:31:06):**  methods they apply.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:31:07):**  So yeah, those are now the people that are tanning our hides and the minimum quantity  
**[0:31:14-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:31:14):**  that we need to hit is 25 hides.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:31:17):**  So 250 pairs of shoes, we're always collecting leather until we get that.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:31:23):**  And eventually, once that leather is ready, we ship it back to Italy to our manufacturer  
**[0:31:28-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:31:28):**  to have it turned into shoes.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:31:31):**  But here again, we're facing this challenge of a non-industrial production where when  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:31:38):**  you cut the pattern pieces, you definitely have more imperfections.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:31:42):**  And sometimes they're nice and charming.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:31:45):**  Sometimes they're pretty visible and people who have high standards and expectations from  
**[0:31:51-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:31:51):**  a luxury shoe might not end up buying a shoe where you can see visible imperfections.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:31:56):**  So we would have to cut around those which lowers the efficiency of the leather and makes  
**[0:32:01-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:32:01):**  production more expensive.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:32:03):**  But overall, and in the end, once we've gone through all the steps, we get a product that  
**[0:32:10-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:32:10):**  from far away looks like our best selling and original sneaker, the Capri model, which  
**[0:32:16-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:32:16):**  is a clean and minimalist shoe.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:32:18):**  But if you look closer, you can really see this beautiful leather that has a lot of character  
**[0:32:23-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:32:23):**  and where you can rest assured that it really contributes to healthy ecosystems and a healthier  
**[0:32:30-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:32:30):**  planet.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:32:31):**  And so what are next steps there?  
**[0:32:33-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:32:33):**  I mean, you're launching obviously, you're going to sell this first batch and then hopefully  
**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:32:36):**  slowly I mean, there are not many so you hopefully sell out etc.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:32:40):**  And you'll be launching the first regenerative leather luxury shoe in the world.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:32:45):**  But what are the next steps like this year to tackle?  
**[0:32:48-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:32:48):**  Is it scaling up?  
**[0:32:49-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:32:49):**  Is it finding more heights?  
**[0:32:50-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:32:50):**  Is it changing the tanning?  
**[0:32:52-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:32:52):**  Is it working on the sole and other pieces of the shoe?  
**[0:32:54-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:32:54):**  Like what are you maybe all of the above?  
**[0:32:56-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:32:56):**  But what are you mostly excited about to tackle this year?  
**[0:32:59-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:32:59):**  In the very near term, our first goal will be to introduce more colours.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:33:03):**  The first capsule that we're dropping is going to be black leather and chestnut coloured  
**[0:33:08-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:33:08):**  leather, which are current top sellers.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:33:10):**  So that's great.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:33:11):**  But we want to introduce more colours.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:33:13):**  We're known for having an array of minimalist, neutral, quite beautiful colours and we want  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:33:22):**  to introduce an array of nice colours also for regenerative leather.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:33:27):**  That in itself is quite tricky because typically how you achieve colour in leather is you chrome  
**[0:33:34-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:33:34):**  tan the leather and make it like it's called wet blue, which is like a very bright whitish  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:33:41):**  blue and then you can just dye it and have coatings and achieve the perfect colour.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:33:46):**  But what we're doing here is we're sourcing the highest quality, most environmentally  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:33:52):**  sustainable leather from the Swiss Alps.  
**[0:33:56-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:33:56):**  Obviously we don't want to just put a plastic coating on it.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:33:59):**  We want to have a high quality tanning and dyeing method and doing the research for that,  
**[0:34:05-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:34:05):**  how to achieve the right colours and the colours that we want is a whole other project.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:34:10):**  And that's what we're currently busying ourselves with.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:34:14):**  And then once we've introduced these colours, we can look into our long-term goal.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:34:22):**  Our long-term goal is to make a shoe that is completely sourced from Regener farms and  
**[0:34:29-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:34:29):**  that is biodegradable.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:34:33):**  And if we break this down into both components, completely sourced from Regener farms means  
**[0:34:39-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:34:39):**  sourcing the leather from Regener farms, but also the outsole from regeneratively managed  
**[0:34:47-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:34:47):**  kauchook forests, tree rubber forests, the laces from regeneratively farmed cotton or  
**[0:34:56-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:34:56):**  hemp and on and on and on because a shoe has many components and many of them you don't  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:35:01):**  even see like packing materials or insoles.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:35:05):**  So our ambition is to bit by bit find out how we can source all of these components  
**[0:35:11-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:35:11):**  from regenerative farms.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:35:14):**  And then the second part to it is biodegradability.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:35:18):**  We want to make a shoe that if you were to throw it away into the forest, it would actually  
**[0:35:24-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:35:24):**  biodegrade over a not too long period of time.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:35:27):**  And here the processing is super important next to the materials that we actually source.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:35:35):**  So the leather processing is very important.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:35:37):**  We need to find the right tanning method, the right dyeing method to make the leather  
**[0:35:42-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:35:42):**  super stable and comfortable, but also unstable enough so that it can decompose in the soil  
**[0:35:49-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:35:49):**  when it's around the right microbes.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:35:51):**  The same for all the other materials, the kauchook, outsole and all the other elements.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:35:57):**  So yeah, it's a big vision and it's definitely a lot of research and development work towards  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:36:04):**  that, but we're making some very meaningful strides.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:36:08):**  One example of like a move towards biodegradability is we found a construction method where we  
**[0:36:16-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:36:16):**  basically don't have to use glue in order to combine the upper of the shoes, so the  
**[0:36:22-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:36:22):**  leather part and the sole.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:36:24):**  And that's pretty much unheard of in sneakers.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:36:27):**  Right now you still use a lot of glue in sneaker production to bond the upper and the bottom  
**[0:36:35-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:36:35):**  of the shoe.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:36:36):**  And by using that glue, you make it basically impossible to A, recycle and B, have that  
**[0:36:43-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:36:43):**  shoe biodegrade.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:36:45):**  So yeah, finding a construction method that only uses stitching and no glue is a massive  
**[0:36:50-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:36:50):**  achievement and something that we'll integrate in our shoes in the next 12 months.  
**[0:36:55-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:36:55):**  Wow.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:36:56):**  So what do you see for like this launch in the fashion industry?  
**[0:37:01-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:37:01):**  Do you see a lot of interest?  
**[0:37:03-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:37:03):**  Do you hope, I mean, obviously you might be hoped to be sort of copied in terms of this  
**[0:37:07-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:37:07):**  impact and not necessarily on the designs, et cetera.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:37:10):**  And what do you see this, is there a growing interest in the sourcing of materials in going  
**[0:37:15-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:37:15):**  as deep as you're going?  
**[0:37:17-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:37:17):**  I mean, there are a few examples.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:37:18):**  I think there's Fivo Barefoot on definitely not on a luxurious path, but that have been  
**[0:37:23-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:37:23):**  very vocal about regenerative.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:37:25):**  There's land to market with Timberland on the leather side of things, but it's US obviously  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:37:28):**  you're selling in the US, but are sourcing in Europe.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:37:32):**  What do you see happening?  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:37:33):**  Is there something happening beyond sustainable in the fashion space or have I mentioned just  
**[0:37:38-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:37:38):**  the two others that are out there?  
**[0:37:40-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:37:40):**  That's pretty much it.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:37:41):**  You have mentioned the two that are most prominent.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:37:45):**  Timberland is the one that immediately comes to mind and they've done great things.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:37:49):**  It's really impressive how such a big company is making meaningful commitments around regenerative  
**[0:37:55-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:37:55):** . If you look at European brands, especially luxury conglomerates, it's interesting.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:38:03):**  They are definitely aware of it and want to do something in regenerative.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:38:08):**  I mean, I've seen things like Gucci has made commitments or a big statement.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:38:12):**  So let's say commitments.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:38:13):**  Exactly.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:38:14):**  So Kering, for example, they launched a biodiversity fund to convert land use to regenerate farming  
**[0:38:21-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:38:21):**  practices.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:38:22):**  And LBMH now targets the preservation or restoration of five million hectares of habitat for flora  
**[0:38:30-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:38:30):**  and fauna by 2030.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:38:32):**  In the US Ralph Lauren Foundation, they just announced a grant for regenerative cotton  
**[0:38:39-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:38:39):**  of five million dollars.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:38:41):**  So you can see that people are aware of it and they're doing something.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:38:45):**  But at this point, it seems like it's really like chief sustainability officer and communication  
**[0:38:51-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:38:51):**  officer probably.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:38:52):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:38:53):**  And not chief product officer.  
**[0:38:55-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:38:55):**  Exactly.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:38:56):**  And some fund commitments, which are probably even fairly small in comparison to the revenues  
**[0:39:04-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:39:04):**  that these companies are making.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:39:06):**  So I think that awareness is there, but many conglomerates and brands find it extremely  
**[0:39:12-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:39:12):**  challenging to make a regenerative product reality.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:39:17):**  And yeah, I get it.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:39:19):**  It's really hard and you really need to rethink your whole supply chain and you need to be  
**[0:39:27-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:39:27):**  happy with relatively modest volume at the beginning and then find ways to scale that.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:39:35):**  And we're very lucky in that we're on the one hand, an established company.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:39:40):**  We've been around for a couple of years now and on the other hand, are still nimble enough  
**[0:39:46-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:39:46):**  to find such a project meaningful.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:39:50):**  Therefore we're probably just at the right size to be a leader in regenerative luxury  
**[0:39:56-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:39:56):**  footwear.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:39:57):**  And just to give an idea for people that are not so much in this space, like the luxury  
**[0:40:01-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:40:01):**  world is enormous.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:40:03):**  Like how much money is going through there every year?  
**[0:40:06-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:40:06):**  I mean, maybe 2020 wasn't a good year to measure, but in terms of just in terms of sheer size,  
**[0:40:11-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:40:11):**  what are we talking about more or less?  
**[0:40:13-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:40:13):**  Like these conglomerates you mentioned are not household names, usually Keiring and LVMH,  
**[0:40:18-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:40:18):**  but they are mostly family owned still and absolutely massive.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:40:22):**  Just to give a number, what are we talking about?  
**[0:40:24-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:40:24):**  Yeah, I mean, it's huge.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:40:26):**  Bain does this great study where they look at the luxury market.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:40:32):**  I don't have the number off the top of my head, but...  
**[0:40:35-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:40:35):**  We'll put it in the show notes.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:40:36):**  Absolutely not to underestimate market.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:40:39):**  And if you would be telling investors that are interested in regeneration and regen ag  
**[0:40:44-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:40:44):**  and food, what would you, obviously without giving investment advice, but what would you  
**[0:40:48-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:40:48):**  tell them where to look in the fashion industry?  
**[0:40:51-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:40:51):**  Is that companies like yourself that are not too big, not too small?  
**[0:40:54-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:40:54):**  Is that startup?  
**[0:40:55-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:40:55):**  Is that really the technology side of things?  
**[0:40:57-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:40:57):**  Where do you get excited for potential investments or for investors to let's say, dig a bit deeper  
**[0:41:03-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:41:03):**  and potentially also investing?  
**[0:41:05-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:41:05):**  What parts of the fashion industry are extremely interesting from a regeneration perspective?  
**[0:41:10-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:41:10):**  Yeah, I think it's very case by case.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:41:13):**  And it's the companies that are extremely authentic about their efforts and that go  
**[0:41:20-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:41:20):**  deep in these efforts.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:41:23):**  You can see it with sustainability, with a sustainability wave over the last 10 years.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:41:29):**  Only a few companies were really, really serious.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:41:32):**  And for a lot of them, it was a marketing promotion and it was greenwashing.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:41:40):**  So if you look at regenerative, it has to be companies where people are going super  
**[0:41:45-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:41:45):**  deep and question everything, because those are the ones that are going to be around and  
**[0:41:53-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:41:53):**  will be able to be challenged on this topic over years and withstand any public scrutiny  
**[0:42:00-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:42:00):**  around this topic, which will for sure happen as regenerative becomes more popular and the  
**[0:42:07-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:42:07):**  public starts to ask more questions around it.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:42:10):**  And where do you see that?  
**[0:42:12-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:42:12):**  I mean, we're not going to conferences very often, but at the moment when you talk to  
**[0:42:16-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:42:16):**  peers in the fashion industry that are looking at sustainability and are going deeper, where  
**[0:42:21-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:42:21):**  do you really think different?  
**[0:42:23-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:42:23):**  Like what do you believe to be true?  
**[0:42:25-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:42:25):**  What others in your peers not necessarily agree on?  
**[0:42:28-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:42:28):**  Like where are you contrarian?  
**[0:42:29-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:42:29):**  And this question definitely comes from John Kempf, inspired by his podcast.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:42:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:42:33):**  I mean, there's a massive trend towards anything vegan right now.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:42:38):**  And I see the solution as being much more holistic than just focusing on vegan.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:42:47):**  We talked about it briefly before, but let's unpack it a bit more.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:42:50):**  Like what's the biggest issue there?  
**[0:42:52-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:42:52):**  Because I see the exams, I see fruit letter coming up.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:42:54):**  I see it sounds wonderful.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:42:55):**  I don't know enough about it.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:42:57):**  And you saying others, but it's like, is the main, I wouldn't say argument against it,  
**[0:43:01-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:43:01):**  but the main issue with it, all the plastics and all the chemicals, like what's the main  
**[0:43:04-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:43:04):**  issue with it and why hasn't it taken off as I've seen many nice pilots, let's say,  
**[0:43:10-0:43:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:43:10):**  or nice, nice, small examples.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:43:11):**  Like of course there's pineapple and leather and of course, and I thought it would be amazing.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:43:15):**  What is your response as a shoemaker and shoe seller to that?  
**[0:43:18-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:43:18):**  Yeah, I was equally excited.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:43:20):**  Fruit leather, pineapple leather, apple leather, mushroom leather.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:43:24):**  And as soon as we heard about it, we looked into it.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:43:28):**  What we quickly saw was these materials are kind of monstrous in the sense that sure you  
**[0:43:35-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:43:35):**  have some organic component of it that comes from apples or pineapples or mushroom, but  
**[0:43:43-0:43:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:43:43):**  there's so much plastic in these things.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:43:47):**  Sometimes it's a majority of the final product is plastic.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:43:51):**  And then it's back to that problem you're replacing one issue with another issue and  
**[0:43:58-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:43:58):**  not only perpetuate these materials, fossil fuel dependency, or if you have plastic that  
**[0:44:07-0:44:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:44:07):**  is plant-based in most cases, very likely monoculture farming.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:44:13):**  You also have a product where all sorts of different compounds are mixed together and  
**[0:44:20-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:44:20):**  bonded together and that stuff is never going to be able to be recycled because you can  
**[0:44:28-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:44:28):**  take these components apart and it's also not going to biodegrade.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:44:33):**  So the only place this is going to end up is a landfill.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:44:37):**  And for that reason, it's not a solution at all.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:44:40):**  And in contrast to that, the leather that we're sourcing is still a by-product of the  
**[0:44:47-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:44:47):**  meat industry.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:44:48):**  Like if you look at the, it's really a waste product and oftentimes cow hides are burned  
**[0:44:54-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:44:54):**  or thrown away because in many cases it's not economic to turn them into leather.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:45:00):**  If you look at the value of a cow hide, it's actually less than the tongue of the cow.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:45:06):**  So it's like, and especially I'm imagining the certain drop, but this line you're developing  
**[0:45:12-0:45:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:45:12):**  now or you're launching now are cow hides that have even less value because they are  
**[0:45:16-0:45:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:45:16):**  not perfect.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:45:17):**  And the chances of them being thrown away are very, very high, I'm imagining.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:45:22):**  Exactly.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:45:23):**  Most of them would be thrown, if not all of them, would be thrown away.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:45:26):**  And we're taking these hides that throughout the cow's life have really contributed to  
**[0:45:31-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:45:31):**  a healthy planet and maintaining a beautiful ecosystem, the Swiss Alps, and then value  
**[0:45:38-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:45:38):**  that material and appreciate it and make leather out of it in the most responsible and environmentally  
**[0:45:46-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:45:46):**  friendly ways that are possible.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:45:49):**  So yeah, if I look at these two options, vegan, like plastic hybrid leathers and our regenerative  
**[0:45:58-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:45:58):**  leathers, I would always pick our leather in terms of the overall impact and what it  
**[0:46:03-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:46:03):**  does for the planet.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:46:05):**  Have there been any life cycle assessments or LCAs done on these different materials  
**[0:46:10-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:46:10):**  just to see, because I know in the vegan space we had Brad Willigroft or Brett Van Stone  
**[0:46:16-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:46:16):**  of Willigroft, which is a vegan cheesemaker, and they did an LCA on their ingredients or  
**[0:46:20-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:46:20):**  their vegan cheese and found out it was not as impactful as they hoped.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:46:24):**  And so they completely overturned their ingredient list from cashew nuts to beans and white beans  
**[0:46:29-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:46:29):**  and started working with dairy farmers to change their practices into buying white beans  
**[0:46:34-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:46:34):**  from them, et cetera.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:46:35):**  And that triggered quite a huge shift in the company.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:46:38):**  But they also see that many vegan cheese makers are not looking beyond their ingredient list,  
**[0:46:43-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:46:43):**  are actually not looking at their ingredient list, and simply because it's vegan, it's  
**[0:46:47-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:46:47):**  better in terms of impact.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:46:48):**  But that turned out not to be the case.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:46:51):**  So are you seeing any of that happening in the vegan leather space or is it that too  
**[0:46:55-0:47:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:46:55):**  early or you see vegan leather and people think it's better than anything else?  
**[0:47:00-0:47:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:47:00):**  Yeah, it's that heuristic that's happening right now.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:47:02):**  I haven't seen anything compelling around the life cycle assessment.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:47:09):**  I mean, some companies measure their carbon impact.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:47:13):**  But yeah, we looked into that as well.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:47:16):**  In the end, it's other providers that offer this service.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:47:21):**  And these assessments are extremely expensive.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:47:24):**  We looked into it, it was something like $100,000 per style, and we have like 20, 30 styles.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:47:32):**  We'd rather invest that money into research and digging deep and doing something that  
**[0:47:36-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:47:36):**  we feel is absolutely right than trying to show something.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:47:40):**  And in terms of difference for the farmer, maybe that's a step too far at the moment,  
**[0:47:45-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:47:45):**  but the fact that you're bringing value or creating value out of practically a waste  
**[0:47:50-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:47:50):**  product, would that at some point, maybe not now, would that at some point be interesting  
**[0:47:53-0:47:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:47:53):**  for the farmer as well?  
**[0:47:55-0:47:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:47:55):**  Would it always be so little that it's maybe two tongs or something like that, that it  
**[0:47:59-0:48:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:47:59):**  can have a difference?  
**[0:48:00-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:48:00):**  Or what do you see there as for the bottom line of a farmer?  
**[0:48:03-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:48:03):**  Would that be a rancher?  
**[0:48:05-0:48:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:48:05):**  Sorry, I always get corrected when I say it wrong.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:48:07):**  For a rancher, would that be at some point interesting to also supply this or to also  
**[0:48:11-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:48:11):**  get value from something that anyway is produced as we're producing meat if we continue to  
**[0:48:17-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:48:17):**  do that, obviously?  
**[0:48:18-0:48:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:48:18):**  Yeah, I would love that.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:48:20):**  My conviction is that by going regenerative and being very vocal about it, we're increasing  
**[0:48:27-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:48:27):**  demand and are creating a pool for these kinds of ranching and farming methods.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:48:34):**  And then eventually, I would love if we were part of the system that incentivises more  
**[0:48:43-0:48:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:48:43):**  farmers to go regenerative.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:48:46):**  And if we do that by paying more for the hides, I'm super happy to do that.  
**[0:48:51-0:48:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:48:51):**  And not as a final question, because I have a few more and it's never the final question,  
**[0:48:55-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:48:55):**  but if there's one thing you could change in the fashion industry, I usually ask it  
**[0:48:59-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:48:59):**  about agriculture and food, but in this case, let's say the land use industry or how you're  
**[0:49:02-0:49:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:49:02):**  touching that.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:49:03):**  If you have a magic wand, what would that be?  
**[0:49:05-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:49:05):**  What would be your one, could be anything, could be from a taste, could be colours, could  
**[0:49:11-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:49:11):**  be chemical tanning, could be anything you can possibly imagine or consciousness, but  
**[0:49:15-0:49:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:49:15):**  what would it be if you had this global power?  
**[0:49:18-0:49:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:49:18):**  What would be your one thing you would change overnight?  
**[0:49:21-0:49:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:49:21):**  It would be complete transparency about production processes.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:49:26):**  Because I think there's a lot that customers don't see and a lot that many brands get away  
**[0:49:32-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:49:32):**  with.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:49:33):**  And for us as a brand that really tries to do things right, we're having to do so much  
**[0:49:39-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:49:39):**  education and convincing of customers of what we're doing and why it's better.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:49:45):**  And that, yeah, I wish there were perfect transparency and everyone could see the reality  
**[0:49:51-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:49:51):**  and be much better informed in that way and make better decisions when they're buying  
**[0:49:57-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:49:57):**  fashion.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:49:58):**  And let's say you would be, so you'd no longer have the magic wand, unfortunately, but you  
**[0:50:03-0:50:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:50:03):**  are in charge of a large investment portfolio.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:50:06):**  Focusing could be on fashion, but in sustainability, maybe in general regeneration, where would  
**[0:50:11-0:50:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:50:11):**  your priorities be?  
**[0:50:12-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:50:12):**  Would you set up your own tanning?  
**[0:50:15-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:50:15):**  Would you start your own ranch?  
**[0:50:18-0:50:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:50:18):**  Would you launch other brands into different areas of the fashion industry?  
**[0:50:23-0:50:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:50:23):**  What would you do if you wouldn't be the shoemaker and seller or the shoe seller, but if you  
**[0:50:27-0:50:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:50:27):**  would be an investor in the space, what would you prioritise?  
**[0:50:30-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:50:30):**  Yeah, that's a great question.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:50:32):**  I would focus on the supply chain because, yeah, like I said, that's one of the big challenges  
**[0:50:36-0:50:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:50:36):**  that we face.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:50:37):**  And I would probably invest in turning ranching into regenerative and scaling that or replacing  
**[0:50:47-0:50:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:50:47):**  current conventional meat production with regenerative, environmentally beneficial meat  
**[0:50:53-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:50:53):**  production.  
**[0:50:54-0:51:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:50:54):**  And then, yeah, we would use the byproducts, the hides to make the leather and also tan  
**[0:51:00-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:51:00):**  it in a responsible way and make these shoes.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:51:02):**  Yeah, that would be your focus.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:51:05):**  So you would really focus, really the bottleneck at the moment is the number of hides, if I  
**[0:51:10-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:51:10):**  like to source them in a big enough bundle because you cannot have them like two in Portugal,  
**[0:51:17-0:51:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:51:17):**  one in Denmark and then another few a week in Norway and then a few in Germany, like  
**[0:51:21-0:51:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:51:21):**  you need them sort of concentrated.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:51:22):**  That's why you're in Switzerland.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:51:24):**  But that's the biggest bottleneck at the moment.  
**[0:51:25-0:51:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:51:25):**  You're saying, I mean, apart from a lot of research into glue replacement and all of  
**[0:51:29-0:51:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:51:29):**  that, is the sheer just a number of biodynamic or at least close to regenerative hides you're  
**[0:51:35-0:51:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:51:35):**  getting in Europe?  
**[0:51:38-0:51:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:51:38):**  That's correct.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:51:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:51:40):**  We wish we had easy access to those.  
**[0:51:41-0:51:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:51:41):**  It's fascinating to hear if anybody has a 10 or 20 hides a week laying around in Europe,  
**[0:51:47-0:51:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:51:47):**  they should definitely give you a call, I think.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:51:49):**  Yes.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:51:50):**  Please let us know.  
**[0:51:51-0:51:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:51:51):**  I want to thank you so much for sharing your honest and for your openness and to this journey  
**[0:51:56-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:51:56):**  into leather that I never thought we would do, but I'm very happy we did because I learned  
**[0:52:00-0:52:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:52:00):**  a lot.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:52:01):**  I learned a lot about the different sides of the business, the complexity, the chemical  
**[0:52:05-0:52:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:52:05):**  use and that you can even get sick if leather has been treated very, very, very badly.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:52:09):**  Again, that's not a norm, but it can happen, which is an interesting bridge, obviously,  
**[0:52:12-0:52:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:52:12):**  to the food industry where we talk about food as medicine a whole lot, but I never imagined  
**[0:52:17-0:52:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:52:17):**  and it makes so much sense when you think about it, that what you wear obviously gets  
**[0:52:21-0:52:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:52:21):**  into your skin and into your body as well.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:52:23):**  So thank you and good luck with the launch.  
**[0:52:25-0:52:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:52:25):**  It will be when we are listening to this, it will be launched and I'm hoping it sells  
**[0:52:29-0:52:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:52:29):**  out very quickly, which means you need to get to work and get to the next batch.

**[0:54:46-0:54:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:54:46):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.

**[0:55:13-0:55:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:55:13):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:55:15):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:55:20-0:55:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:55:20):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:55:25-0:55:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:55:25):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:55:29-0:55:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:55:29):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:55:31):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:55:36-0:55:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:55:36):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.

**[0:55:45-0:55:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:55:45):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:55:46-0:55:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:55:46):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:55:48-0:55:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:55:48):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:55:50-0:55:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:55:50):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:55:54-0:55:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/johannes-quodt#t=0:55:54):**  It's also not investment advice.

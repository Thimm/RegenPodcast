**[0:00:20-0:00:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:20):**  Many farmers are ready to speed up their regenerative transition.  They've looked for learning, done the courses, read the key books, hosted the gurus on their  farms, explored farm-sized regenerative designs and most importantly started their pilots  
**[0:00:32-0:00:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:32):**  and feedback loops.  This is where transition finance is key.  A local bank loan often isn't feasible because of the short duration, lack of flexibility  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:42):**  and the farmers lack of collateral.  Furthermore, there is a limit of how much equity a farmer is able or willing to give  away.

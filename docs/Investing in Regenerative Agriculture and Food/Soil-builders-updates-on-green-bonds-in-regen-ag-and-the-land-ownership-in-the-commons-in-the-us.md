**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:00:14):**  Welcome to Soil Builders, a series where we follow who is building soils at scale.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:00:18):**  This is an experiment, so please share any feedback.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:00:21):**  Today we check in with Fabio Sakamoto of Rizoma Agro, who just raised a 25 million brazilian  
**[0:00:26-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:00:26):**  row, which is about 3.7 million euros or 4.3 million dollars, Green Bond, the first ever  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:00:32):**  in agriculture, certified by the Climate Bond Initiative, led by Sean Kidney, who we interviewed  
**[0:00:37-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:00:37):**  last year.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:00:38):**  And we're checking in with Ian McSweeney of the Agrarian Trust, who shares how much has  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:00:41):**  happened at the Agrarian Trust around land ownership in the commons in the US, how they  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:00:47):**  have been acquiring farms into the commons and how they've launched 12 community-centered  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:00:52):**  agrarian commons throughout 10 states in the US.  
**[0:00:56-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:00:56):**  Why this show Soil Builders?  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:00:57):**  I believe that most change in regenerative agriculture and food will come from, and is  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:01:01):**  coming from, entrepreneurs building ways to regenerate soil at scale.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:01:05):**  I call these Soil Builders.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:01:07):**  Soil Builders are entrepreneurial farmers, agtech companies, investment funds, food startups,  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:01:12):**  new seed cooperatives, teams within food companies, robot startups, investment vehicles, etc,  
**[0:01:17-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:01:17):**  etc, etc.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:01:18):**  All regenerating soil beyond their own farm gate and with more than their own money.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:01:23):**  This series allows the community of the podcast, which is you, full of funders, investors and  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:01:27):**  fellow soil builders to follow their progress, their challenges and their breakthroughs.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:01:32):**  I hope you enjoy it and please reach out with any comments, feedback and ideas.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:01:36):**  First up, a short update from Fabio Sakamoto.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:01:40):**  Why am I so excited about green bonds in Region Ag?  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:01:42):**  Because it shows that Region Ag can attract traditional, maybe even lower cost capital,  
**[0:01:46-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:01:46):**  and thus scale.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:01:47):**  Green bonds are an enormous market and so far have largely ignored agriculture.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:01:52):**  So this could be the first, and let's hope this, of many green bonds in the space.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:01:56):**  Hi Fabio, congrats with the launch of the first ever green bond certified by the Climate  
**[0:02:01-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:02:01):**  Bond Initiative in agriculture.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:02:04):**  How did this come about?  
**[0:02:05-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:02:05):**  Why did you decide to raise a green bond?  
**[0:02:07-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:02:07):**  Hi Keren, thank you.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:02:10):**  We've been thinking about a green bond for quite some time now.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:02:13):**  As you know, our central thesis at Risso Magro is that regenerative agriculture will scale  
**[0:02:19-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:02:19):**  because it is a good business and in being a good business, we should be able to access  
**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:02:26):**  mainstream capital.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:02:27):**  Yeah, so we've been studying this topic for a while.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:02:31):**  I know CBI had been looking at this and developing the criteria for agriculture for some time.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:02:37):**  They're very serious.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:02:40):**  So when they opened the criteria, we were ready.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:02:43):**  We had all the information.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:02:45):**  We were, you know, hats off to my team for being very quick.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:02:50):**  And yeah, so this is how we got to admit the first green bond in the world for agriculture.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:02:56):**  And it is an honor.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:02:57):**  And yeah, and for me, what was great about the process was that it confirms our hypothesis.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:03:03):**  The green bond was sold out in two hours.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:03:07):**  It was oversubscribed by more than four times.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:03:11):**  And we didn't know any of the investors that bought the bond and when we talked to some  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:03:16):**  of them, we realized they were not investors that usually invest in agriculture or investors  
**[0:03:22-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:03:22):**  that are necessarily impact investors looking for sustainability.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:03:26):**  When I talked to them, they said, well, we bought the bond because we think you have  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:03:30):**  a good business, which to me is the biggest compliment I could receive and which makes  
**[0:03:36-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:03:36):**  me very optimistic about how fast Regen Ag can grow with this type of market access.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:03:45):**  And what will you use this green bond for, which was, by the way, heavily oversubscribed?  
**[0:03:50-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:03:50):**  This green bond will be used mainly on investments on our existing farm.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:03:57):**  So here at Rizoma Agro, we are trying to produce regenerative organic at the same cost as conventional.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:04:04):**  And right now, our priorities are in expanding our bio inputs factory where we multiply fungi  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:04:10):**  and bacteria that we use as crop protection.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:04:15):**  We're also expanding our composting and compost tea operation.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:04:19):**  We are investing in ag tech tools to digitalize our farm management.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:04:25):**  We're also investing in a few machines.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:04:27):**  So that's our priorities here.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:04:29):**  And a smaller part of the green bond will also be used to exchange short term working  
**[0:04:35-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:04:35):**  capital debt for longer term debt.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:04:38):**  So thus strengthening our balance sheets and creating a more resilient operation.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:04:44):**  And what will you do differently next time?  
**[0:04:46-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:04:46):**  What have you learned, obviously, if you're going to raise another green bond at some  
**[0:04:49-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:04:49):**  point in the future?  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:04:51):**  I think there will be a next one, Koen, because we've been pretty busy with our expansion  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:04:56):**  plans for 2021.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:04:58):**  And because this first experience was very positive for us, not much I would change.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:05:05):**  What I am considering is opening this next green bond for investors abroad.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:05:10):**  We had some inquiries, but the first emission was just for investors in Brazil.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:05:17):**  And if there are any investors listening out there that are interested, please reach out  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:05:21):**  and it would be great to get a sense of level of interest.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:05:26):**  Anything else you would like to share with the podcast community?  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:05:29):**  Koen, I'm just excited about everything that's happening in the space and how quickly it's  
**[0:05:34-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:05:34):**  developing.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:05:35):**  My business partner Pedro helped co-produce the Kiss the Ground documentary that's on  
**[0:05:40-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:05:40):**  Netflix now.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:05:41):**  And I see a lot more people joining the conversation.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:05:44):**  I also see people in the industry, the food companies and in the investment industry,  
**[0:05:51-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:05:51):**  understanding the role and the opportunity that is here.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:05:54):**  So I'm just excited about everything that's happened, even though it wasn't an easy year  
**[0:05:58-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:05:58):**  for the world.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:06:00):**  It was very positive for Regen Ag.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:06:03):**  And it was a pleasure talking to you again.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:06:06):**  Stay safe and take care.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:06:08):**  Next up, an update from Ian about the thorniest of thorny issues in agriculture, land ownership.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:06:13):**  Why are some people born into lots of land and not interested in farming at all?  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:06:17):**  Why are some people who want to farm cannot access any land?  
**[0:06:20-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:06:20):**  And why are others pushed off their ancestral land?  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:06:23):**  And what can we do about all this and what's the role of money?  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:06:25):**  The Agrarian Trust is taking on this long and difficult work in the US to make land  
**[0:06:29-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:06:29):**  more accessible, not extractively managed and equitable.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:06:32):**  They have made huge progress since we last talked over two years ago.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:06:35):**  So enjoy this update.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:06:36):**  Hi, Ian, could you give us an update on what has happened since you were on the podcast  
**[0:06:41-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:06:41):**  more than two years ago?  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:06:43):**  So what has happened over the last two years at Agrarian Trust?  
**[0:06:47-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:06:47):**  We as an organization have grown.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:06:49):**  We've grown our staffing capacity.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:06:52):**  We've grown and manifested our work through the different initiatives we're involved in.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:06:58):**  Agrarian Legal, Faith Lands and Agrarian Commons have really developed into their own bodies  
**[0:07:06-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:07:06):**  of work.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:07:07):**  Each has active work underway.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:07:10):**  Each has staff and focus attending to them.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:07:15):**  Agrarian Commons and Faith Lands both through committee work and network creation and collaborative  
**[0:07:25-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:07:25):**  learning has developed a body of knowledge.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:07:28):**  And that knowledge and learning for both of those individually are being developed into  
**[0:07:34-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:07:34):**  online open source resource toolkits that should be available right around the end of  
**[0:07:41-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:07:41):**  this calendar year to really provide resource examples and knowledge to those in faith communities  
**[0:07:52-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:07:52):**  and those with interest in commons and community centered farm ownership.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:07:59):**  And those toolkits will provide examples, models, templates, resources, learning as  
**[0:08:09-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:08:09):**  open source kind of assets for all communities that seek to use them to expand their work  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:08:17):**  on land ownership, access and tenure.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:08:22):**  Most significant growth over the last two years has been the Agrarian Commons work.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:08:28):**  We've developed relationships, brought together partners and stakeholders in communities.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:08:35):**  And on May 1st of this year, we incorporated 10 community centered local Agrarian Commons  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:08:43):**  in 10 different states across the United States.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:08:47):**  We've since added two additional Agrarian Commons where we now have 12 community centered  
**[0:08:53-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:08:53):**  Agrarian Commons 501c2 land holding entities in 10 different states, California, Washington,  
**[0:09:03-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:09:03):**  Montana, Minnesota, West Virginia, Tennessee, Virginia, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:09:13):**  And those Commons are community centered land holding entities with their own boards, their  
**[0:09:19-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:09:19):**  own identity, their own mission and are moving forward with farm land projects.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:09:29):**  In June of this year, we launched forward our first crowdsource capital raise, a philanthropic  
**[0:09:36-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:09:36):**  capital raise to raise the capital needed to acquire a 104 acre organic farm in central  
**[0:09:44-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:09:44):**  Maine.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:09:45):**  We launched that at the end of June.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:09:48):**  At the end of August, we had raised $480,000 from over 1500 donors from across the country,  
**[0:09:58-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:09:58):**  from across the globe, who donated in on average $144 to make this possible.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:10:06):**  So with that capital raise, we were able to acquire the 104 acre organic farm into the  
**[0:10:15-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:10:15):**  main Agrarian Commons, the little Juba Agrarian Commons, where the majority of that board  
**[0:10:22-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:10:22):**  is new American Somali Bantu community members in Lewiston, Maine.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:10:29):**  And on October 1, we conveyed secure equitable lease tenure to Liberation Farm, a collective  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:10:39):**  farm initiative of the Somali Bantu Community Association.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:10:44):**  So they now have secure tenure and a home to continue to grow food and to expand their  
**[0:10:51-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:10:51):**  ability to address food security and to move towards a community that can hold up and live  
**[0:11:00-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:11:00):**  into a food sovereignty.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:11:03):**  So that farm ownership is in the Agrarian Commons structure.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:11:08):**  We had also taken donation of a farm into the Agrarian Commons structure, donation of  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:11:14):**  a farm on Whidbey Island at the end of 2019.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:11:19):**  So presently, the model has two farms in ownership within the model.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:11:25):**  We have a number of other farm projects.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:11:27):**  In total, we have 17 farm projects that we've done initial evaluation and vetting and exploration  
**[0:11:36-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:11:36):**  of and have agreements in place to move forward, engage people, raise capital, acquire the  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:11:43):**  farm, complete the real estate due diligence, in some cases accept the donation of farm  
**[0:11:49-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:11:49):**  in, in others.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:11:51):**  It's a discounted acquisition of farm in, but to acquire those farms into the structure  
**[0:11:57-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:11:57):**  and convey lease tenure out.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:12:00):**  Regarding the Agrarian Trust, what is the key news here?  
**[0:12:04-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:12:04):**  Well, really, as we're sharing the key news of Agrarian Trust is the launch of the Agrarian  
**[0:12:11-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:12:11):**  Commons model.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:12:13):**  The fact that we have 12 community centered nonprofit boards that have come together local  
**[0:12:22-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:12:22):**  to their community valuing a new way to hold land, to own land and farms, a new way to  
**[0:12:30-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:12:30):**  convey tenure and a new way to address equity is, is considerable.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:12:37):**  The fact that there's recognition for the importance of addressing ownership, tenure  
**[0:12:43-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:12:43):**  and equity in farming and expanding the work of land trusts to focus in these areas is  
**[0:12:52-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:12:52):**  significant.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:12:54):**  This is a new innovative model in the United States.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:13:00):**  This type of structure does not exist in the United States until we brought it forward.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:13:05):**  So, you know, there's kind of significance to that.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:13:11):**  It also doesn't exist at this scale at all either.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:13:14):**  So the kind of scale of 12 community centered Agrarian Commons across 10 states across the  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:13:22):**  United States of America is significant.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:13:26):**  Additionally, really the way we've stepped forward with this work and engaged with a  
**[0:13:32-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:13:32):**  crowdsource capital raise to raise philanthropic dollars that, you know, there is a lot of  
**[0:13:40-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:13:40):**  activity with online fundraising platforms that exists over the last 10 years or so.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:13:49):**  What we did was we created our own internal platform to raise that capital.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:13:55):**  So that is unique in and of itself.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:13:58):**  And we also raised significant capital over $480,000 in a very short amount of time from  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:14:06):**  over 1500 donors.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:14:10):**  That's significant.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:14:12):**  The crowdsource platforms that exist do not raise money to acquire farms or land in general.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:14:21):**  Those that are focused on agriculture, it's much smaller dollar raises for buildings,  
**[0:14:28-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:14:28):**  infrastructure type needs.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:14:30):**  So our work to create our own version of a crowdsource fundraising structure and then  
**[0:14:38-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:14:38):**  raise the significant amount of capital needed to acquire a farm is really significant and  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:14:47):**  unique in the model.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:14:51):**  Also speaking to just the number of people that gave to that campaign, over 1500 people  
**[0:14:57-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:14:57):**  is significant.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:14:59):**  And the reality is that of these, you know, we have 17 total farms we're moving forward  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:15:05):**  on.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:15:07):**  Of these 17 total farms, the farms involve their farm communities, their CSA membership,  
**[0:15:17-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:15:17):**  and the other board members and stakeholders on each of these local agrarian commons, their  
**[0:15:24-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:15:24):**  communities and networks.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:15:27):**  We have a kind of aggregate community now engaged in the agrarian commons that has over  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:15:37):**  a quarter million social media followers in total across all these entities.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:15:43):**  So you know, our ability to replicate those type of crowdsource fundraisers where the  
**[0:15:50-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:15:50):**  average donation was $144 and engage multiple other communities across the United States  
**[0:16:00-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:16:00):**  to give similar, you know, to give $50, to give $100, to give $200 towards transformation  
**[0:16:08-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:16:08):**  of how we connect with land, how land is owned, how tenure is conveyed on that land and how  
**[0:16:15-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:16:15):**  we consider and hold equity in that whole equation has significant promise and it has  
**[0:16:24-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:16:24):**  a real developing and growing energy and momentum towards this work.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:16:30):**  So we finished the project in Maine.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:16:33):**  We also own a farm in Washington on Whidbey Island.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:16:38):**  We're about to launch forward a fundraiser to acquire a farm, a philanthropic fundraiser  
**[0:16:45-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:16:45):**  to acquire a farm in West Virginia, followed by fundraise work and farm projects in Tennessee,  
**[0:16:53-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:16:53):**  Virginia and New Hampshire.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:16:55):**  So that kind of, you know, ready queue of projects that are vetted, that have community  
**[0:17:03-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:17:03):**  engaged and the coalesced communities we have around each of these commons and the farms  
**[0:17:10-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:17:10):**  and the structure by which we can and how we've shown that money can be raised to really  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:17:18):**  transform ownership, equity and tenure is significant.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:17:23):**  And what is happening around the Agrarian Commons in the US?  
**[0:17:29-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:17:29):**  So the Agrarian Commons across the United States are really unique and specific to place.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:17:37):**  From one Agrarian Commons to the next, their focus and priorities and stakeholders involved  
**[0:17:43-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:17:43):**  differ.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:17:45):**  And so each has their own work, their own story and their own vision and priorities.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:17:53):**  You know, from the main little Juba Agrarian Commons that I touched upon that's really  
**[0:17:57-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:17:57):**  focused on bringing food security to the Somali Bantu community in Maine.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:18:05):**  Maine is the least diverse state in the United States of America.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:18:11):**  Maine is a state where first generation black Mainers are 52% food insecure.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:18:18):**  And those rates increase significantly when you deal with new Americans, refugees and  
**[0:18:25-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:18:25):**  immigrants.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:18:26):**  So, you know, the Somali Bantu community in Maine faces significant obstacles yet has  
**[0:18:35-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:18:35):**  come persevered and really developed community and shaped identity of place and is really  
**[0:18:43-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:18:43):**  manifesting an American dream that we all should learn from and be inspired by.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:18:50):**  So centering the work on bringing land security, creating a home and creating a farm for the  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:18:59):**  Somali Bantu community in Maine is significant.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:19:03):**  We have other New England Agrarian Commons in Vermont and in New Hampshire.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:19:10):**  Those Agrarian Commons are really focused on larger organic diversified food production  
**[0:19:18-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:19:18):**  community engaged farm operations.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:19:21):**  So in Maine, there's bread and butter farm, and there's a Eagle's Flight farm in New Hampshire,  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:19:29):**  Brookford farm, Vernon family farm and Normanton farm.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:19:35):**  All of those farms represent kind of a focus on organic regenerative agriculture, a focus  
**[0:19:41-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:19:41):**  on community engagement, and really food production to serve that local community, and in a number  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:19:49):**  of cases to serve the broader regional food system as well.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:19:54):**  So those projects are moving forward with the due diligence of the real estate moving  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:20:00):**  forward to develop fundraising steps forward.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:20:05):**  And so that's the work of those Commons.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:20:07):**  One of those farms will be coming into ownership, it's a donation of farm that will come into  
**[0:20:15-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:20:15):**  this common structure in the near term in the next few months, and others will move  
**[0:20:21-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:20:21):**  forward as fundraising launches and success is achieved in raising the capital.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:20:29):**  Moving from there that a West Virginia Agrarian Commons and fundraise that I mentioned, that's  
**[0:20:37-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:20:37):**  a partnership with county, with nonprofit, with other governmental stakeholders in Fayetteville,  
**[0:20:48-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:20:48):**  West Virginia, and it's around bringing ownership of land and resources locally into the community  
**[0:20:58-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:20:58):**  in a way that's secure and can assure that the land will not be extracted from, the land  
**[0:21:06-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:21:06):**  will not be exploited for a benefit, financial or otherwise, from those from afar, that bringing  
**[0:21:14-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:21:14):**  land into local centered ownership, ensuring secure and affordable, equitable tenure for  
**[0:21:22-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:21:22):**  a farmer led producer cooperative, and a nonprofit farm will allow food production, farm business  
**[0:21:33-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:21:33):**  training, education, food access areas address.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:21:39):**  So really that is the work of West Virginia in what is West Virginia and Montana, another  
**[0:21:46-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:21:46):**  Agrarian Commons, we have a real examples of states across the United States that have  
**[0:21:53-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:21:53):**  seen significant extraction of natural resources to really create the United States, create  
**[0:22:02-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:22:02):**  urban centers, create extractive natural resource wealth that exists.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:22:08):**  So healing those lands, regenerating those lands, bringing ownership into local centered  
**[0:22:15-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:22:15):**  structures, ensuring equity locally is critically important and layering that on regenerative  
**[0:22:24-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:22:24):**  farming that's producing food is that much more important.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:22:27):**  So that's the work of those commons.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:22:31):**  In Tennessee there's two farms, Windy Acres Farm and Long Hungry Creek Farm that represent  
**[0:22:37-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:22:37):**  two of the oldest and first organic farms in the state of Tennessee.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:22:44):**  And Windy Acres Farm represents one of the only organic non-GMO grain farms in middle  
**[0:22:50-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:22:50):**  Tennessee.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:22:52):**  Both are serving local community and the larger regional food systems that serve Nashville  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:22:59):**  and Nashville Metro.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:23:01):**  Nashville is one of the fastest growing mid-sized cities across the country and land pricing  
**[0:23:08-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:23:08):**  and land development creates significant pressures in a city that values its food, values its  
**[0:23:16-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:23:16):**  land.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:23:18):**  And so ensuring these legacy inspirational organic farms can be held in this model to  
**[0:23:27-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:23:27):**  ensure the practices and stewardship continues forward and to ensure that they can transition  
**[0:23:34-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:23:34):**  from one generation to the next.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:23:36):**  Both of these farms are exiting landowners that Windy Acres, Alfred Ferris, the primary  
**[0:23:44-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:23:44):**  farmer just passed away earlier this year in February.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:23:50):**  The other farmer on Long Hungry Creek, Jeff Poppin is nearing retirement in farming.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:23:57):**  So ensuring that next generation farmers have access and secure equitable tenure on the  
**[0:24:04-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:24:04):**  land and ensuring that the legacy and career stewardship that both the Ferris's and Jeff  
**[0:24:13-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:24:13):**  Poppin have carried forward on their land and their farms and with their community will  
**[0:24:18-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:24:18):**  continue on is the work there and continue on as farmland is lost, land transitions into  
**[0:24:28-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:24:28):**  other uses and more people develop and live across the landscape and there's a greater  
**[0:24:37-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:24:37):**  need for local food security and food access.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:24:41):**  Ensuring these farms are islands of health and islands of organic food production and  
**[0:24:49-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:24:49):**  community engagement is critical there.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:24:52):**  So that's some examples, there are more examples of what the commons are up to, but that really  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:24:59):**  paints a picture of the diversity across the commons.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:25:05):**  Companies also work on agrarian commons in the Richmond, Virginia area that's focused  
**[0:25:11-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:25:11):**  on manifesting land justice and addressing racial equity in a way that the commons through  
**[0:25:22-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:25:22):**  a nonprofit can.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:25:23):**  That there's limitations of a nonprofit, there's limitations of the commons, but the structure  
**[0:25:29-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:25:29):**  and what it can bring to bear to manifest a just land ownership tenure relationship  
**[0:25:38-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:25:38):**  that is centered on equity is critically important and land trusts have a significant role to  
**[0:25:47-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:25:47):**  play in that and this agrarian commons and others will be illustrating models by which  
**[0:25:57-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:25:57):**  of that can be addressed.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:25:58):**  So many examples, but those are some of the work of the agrarian commons and the uniqueness  
**[0:26:05-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:26:05):**  of place and people involved.

**[0:26:22-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:26:22):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:26:27):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:26:31-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:26:31):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:26:35):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:26:37-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:26:37):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:26:40):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been following the space since 2011  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:26:45):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:26:50):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:26:53-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:26:53):**  How have we built our decision-making framework, what to focus on with the podcast?

**[0:27:47-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/03/soil-builders-2/#t=0:27:47):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.

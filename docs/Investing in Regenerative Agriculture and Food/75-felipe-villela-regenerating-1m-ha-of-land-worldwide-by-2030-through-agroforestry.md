**[0:00:19-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:00:19):**  commodity crops causing deforestation through working with large corporates.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:00:25):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:00:29):**  Everything as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:00:30):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:00:35):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:00:40):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:00:44):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:00:47):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:50-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:00:50):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:00:53):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:00:58):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:01:03):**  In March last year we launched our Patreon community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:26-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:01:26):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:01:28):**  Today I'm joined by Felipe Filella, co-founder of ReNature, working to regenerate nature  
**[0:01:33-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:01:33):**  through agroforestry.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:01:34):**  They work across the globe on crops like cacao, coffee, citrus fruits, white pepper,  
**[0:01:39-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:01:39):**  rubber, leather and cotton.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:01:41):**  Together with large corporates like Veja.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:01:42):**  Welcome Felipe.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:01:43):**  Hi Kun, how is everything?  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:01:45):**  I'm very good.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:01:46):**  I'm looking forward to a conversation on advanced agroforestry, corporates, nutrient density,  
**[0:01:53-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:01:53):**  trees and everything in between.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:01:54):**  Perfect.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:01:55):**  Awesome.  
**[0:01:56-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:01:56):**  No, that's great to be here.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:01:57):**  Thank you so much for the invitation and looking forward also to share a bit more of ReNature  
**[0:02:02-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:02:02):**  and our work with the mission of reaching the one million hectares by 2030 for regenerated  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:02:10):**  land through regenerative agroforestry.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:02:13):**  And yeah, looking forward to where it's going to lead us, this conversation.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:02:17):**  It's nice to be here.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:02:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:02:19):**  So start with a question about you.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:02:21):**  What brings you to Amsterdam?  
**[0:02:23-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:02:23):**  You're based in Amsterdam, but a lot of the agroforestry work you're doing is around the  
**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:02:26):**  globe.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:02:27):**  And what brings you to agroforestry?  
**[0:02:29-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:02:29):**  Perfect.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:02:30):**  And so first of all, I was raised in a family that has been working with one thousand five  
**[0:02:35-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:02:35):**  hundred hectares, large scale organic citrus farming in Brazil and was near Sao Paulo.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:02:42):**  So actually my grandparent, he brought the lemon Thai tea species to Brazil.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:02:48):**  And then basically they started doing citrus farming for a long time, over 60 years.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:02:56):**  And I was always involved in agriculture, organic agriculture.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:03:00):**  And since my family gave me the conditions and also the possibility to explore around  
**[0:03:07-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:03:07):**  the globe, other farms, I went to Africa, I went to the US, I went to Canada.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:03:13):**  And I saw there was a lot of challenges.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:03:17):**  And I came back to Brazil thinking, hey, you know, I'm traveling all over the world.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:03:21):**  I don't even know my own country really well.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:03:23):**  So I decided to go to the Amazon.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:03:25):**  And I saw and I was amazed by the knowledge that the indigenous people inside Amazon,  
**[0:03:32-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:03:32):**  they're, you know, treating nature and making everything from coming from the forest.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:03:38):**  And when I left the Amazon, I saw the massive deforestation for soybean, cattle ranching  
**[0:03:43-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:03:43):**  and the logging industries.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:03:45):**  And I was terrified by the way we are managing the natural resources in that region.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:03:50):**  And I thought like, how deep can we go?  
**[0:03:52-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:03:52):**  I know we need to extract resources for commodity use for corporates, but how responsibly is  
**[0:03:59-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:03:59):**  actually being done.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:04:00):**  So I came back home and I felt like, okay, I went to dig and visit every single agroforestry,  
**[0:04:08-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:04:08):**  regenerative agriculture, organic agriculture.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:04:11):**  You can name all the names, farms that can inspire me enough to see how we can actually  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:04:18):**  make a transition in a global perspective.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:04:22):**  But basically there was a second trip around the world, but the first trip when your family  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:04:26):**  gave you the space to explore, did you visit the conventional chemical side of agriculture?  
**[0:04:31-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:04:31):**  Did you visit your organic side?  
**[0:04:32-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:04:32):**  Did you visit the regenerative side?  
**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:04:34):**  What gave you, what did you explore and why?  
**[0:04:37-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:04:37):**  Yeah, very good question.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:04:39):**  I basically went to dig into all these conventional traditional systems, but looking to like grains,  
**[0:04:48-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:04:48):**  but also looking to a tropical, more like pipe cocoa, coffee, especially mostly.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:04:55):**  And I visualized the differences between the conventional organic and beyond organic kind  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:05:01):**  of regenerative more in line with agroforestry systems.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:05:05):**  And the type of agriculture my family has been always working was organic, but I saw  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:05:09):**  that there was a lot of knowledge and science behind regenerative and agroforestry practices  
**[0:05:15-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:05:15):**  that I went deeper into it.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:05:17):**  And then I basically saw there was a lot of experts in the field and especially in Brazil.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:05:24):**  And one of the main reasons, because people in Brazil, they have been doing this for over  
**[0:05:28-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:05:28):**  60 years.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:05:29):**  And I was amazed by how much knowledge is there, but they don't have access to highly  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:05:35):**  impactful projects that could be developed from their side.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:05:41):**  So why is Brazil such a hotbed of agroforestry and regenerative agriculture development?  
**[0:05:49-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:05:49):**  And for people that don't know, definitely start Googling and start diving into it because  
**[0:05:52-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:05:52):**  there's so much happening there.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:05:54):**  And the question is always why there?  
**[0:05:55-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:05:55):**  And you're saying it's been doing for 60 years.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:05:57):**  So why in the last 60 years has so much been done on understanding these kinds of systems  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:06:03):**  involving very often trees?  
**[0:06:06-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:06:06):**  Perfect.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:06:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:06:08):**  Well, in Brazil, if you dig into the KPIs, it's really on community development.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:06:14):**  So people there, they really work collaboratively to bring cooperatives that they can communicate  
**[0:06:20-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:06:20):**  and then exchange their learnings.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:06:23):**  And I think for being a very community type of culture there, things can disseminate easier  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:06:32):**  than in other cultures, which is more individualistic, let's say.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:06:36):**  And in Brazil, the knowledge of the agroforestry has been done also mostly because 85% of Brazil's  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:06:43):**  food security comes from smallholder farmers.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:06:47):**  And these farmers, they always have been exchanging their experiences and learnings.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:06:52):**  And this has been something that really inspired the agroforestry and regenerative agriculture  
**[0:06:57-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:06:57):**  movement to spread faster.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:06:59):**  And I think in some other countries, it's still growing, but it hasn't been done faster  
**[0:07:05-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:07:05):**  as in Brazil at the moment.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:07:06):**  And so you did this second tour, you went very deep into regenerative ag and agroforestry,  
**[0:07:12-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:07:12):**  and then you decided to set up ReNature.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:07:14):**  How did that come about?  
**[0:07:16-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:07:16):**  Perfect.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:07:17):**  And so yeah, I saw there was a lot of knowledge and experts in the field on the ground.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:07:22):**  I myself wanted to go very deep into the knowledge of it.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:07:27):**  But then I saw there was a really big gap between the dialogue of these experts with  
**[0:07:33-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:07:33):**  companies that has in their supply chain more than hundreds or thousands of farmers that  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:07:40):**  are supplying them with their main commodities like coffee, palm oil, or soybean, or whatever.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:07:46):**  And I spotted an opportunity to actually bring access of these experts to help these companies  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:07:54):**  and corporates to do the transition to regenerative ag and agroforestry systems.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:07:59):**  And we decided to start ReNature focusing on two major countries, Brazil and Indonesia,  
**[0:08:06-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:08:06):**  mainly because of the highest deforestation rate was going too fast.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:08:09):**  And then we kicked off in those two countries.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:08:13):**  And then from that on, we would be looking to other climates and also other countries.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:08:19):**  So the biggest source of inspiration for starting ReNature was really how much deforestation  
**[0:08:25-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:08:25):**  was actually being caused by agriculture and how knowledge of these experts in the field  
**[0:08:31-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:08:31):**  of regenerative ag and agroforestry is displaced and could be well incorporated into this corporate  
**[0:08:40-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:08:40):**  sustainability targets of offsetting their footprint space.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:08:43):**  Yeah, so basically you saw a lot of knowledge on the ground and you saw a lot of willingness  
**[0:08:48-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:08:48):**  of corporates to do something.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:08:50):**  And maybe they even mentioned regenerative ag, or they mentioned their value change,  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:08:54):**  but as soon as they were dealing with thousands or hundreds of farmers, it became very, very  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:08:59):**  difficult to manage that and to implement some of these systems at scale.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:09:03):**  So that's a great idea.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:09:04):**  It's a great approach.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:09:06):**  How do you get into these corporates?  
**[0:09:07-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:09:07):**  Because I think many people listening to this podcast would say, I would love to work with  
**[0:09:10-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:09:10):**  Timbaland, or I would love to work with, name another huge company that has somehow food,  
**[0:09:15-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:09:15):**  fiber and oil in their supply chain.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:09:17):**  How did you get into your first, I think it's on the journey, your first customer, your  
**[0:09:22-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:09:22):**  first corporate?  
**[0:09:23-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:09:23):**  How did that happen?  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:09:24):**  Yeah, so the first two ones that as I mentioned, Brazil and Indonesia, was with Far Farm is  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:09:30):**  a company from New York, New York with regenerative fibers for the fashion industry.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:09:35):**  So we started like a cotton production in the Amazon in Para region as a replacement  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:09:42):**  for deforestation practices used for cassava flower.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:09:46):**  And then we would help these communities.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:09:48):**  It's 40 families that were using, making cassava flower from deforestation.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:09:55):**  And now they have a generation of income from the cotton and other natural fibers for the  
**[0:10:00-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:10:00):**  fashion industry.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:10:01):**  So it's a small company that now are kind of changing the fashion industry slowly in  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:10:08):**  the, and then they were accelerated by a fashion for good here in Amsterdam.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:10:13):**  And now they're also joining forces with Vision.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:10:16):**  And that's one of our potential partners also in the future, as you mentioned before.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:10:22):**  And then Indonesia, we started with Versteegin, this Dutch company, which works with spices  
**[0:10:26-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:10:26):**  and mainly pepper, onion, and turmeric and cinnamon.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:10:33):**  And then we're planting with them white pepper in the Banca Island.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:10:37):**  We started as a pilot with of one hectare, what we call all the farm.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:10:42):**  And then as soon as we showcase the impact metrics of the project in the ecosystem services  
**[0:10:49-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:10:49):**  perspective, but also in the social and economic, showing how much you could potentially reach.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:10:56):**  And then they finance the scalability of this project.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:11:00):**  And we started as a pilot model farm.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:11:02):**  And now as they obtain the results, they are willing to scale that for all the 500 farmers,  
**[0:11:08-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:11:08):**  which is very interesting to see that there is the willingness to also scale this opportunities  
**[0:11:14-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:11:14):**  of a regressive practices.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:11:16):**  And is this approach of a model farm then basically shown to the corporate what could  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:11:22):**  be done in agroforestry because everybody hears about it, but it's probably difficult  
**[0:11:26-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:11:26):**  to imagine in my own supply chain.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:11:28):**  And then basically scaling, is that the model you're, I'm using model twice, is that the  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:11:33):**  model you're using and why are using that specific approach when it comes to big corporates  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:11:38):**  that could maybe also do a lot more at once if they wanted to?  
**[0:11:42-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:11:42):**  Yeah, no, indeed.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:11:44):**  Like most of our proposals, we focus on developing either a model farm or a model school.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:11:50):**  A model farm is one demonstration plot.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:11:54):**  It can vary from one hectare to 10 to 15 to 20, for example.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:11:59):**  And this corporate can obtain the results of the impact that it's causing in the food  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:12:06):**  security element and also the soil regeneration, carbon sequestration, and then also the economical  
**[0:12:12-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:12:12):**  viability of the design.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:12:15):**  And then we have the model school, which is basically as they obtain the results and they  
**[0:12:20-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:12:20):**  are secure of the scale of this model, then they can build an infrastructure to host farmers  
**[0:12:27-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:12:27):**  and their agronomists.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:12:29):**  So they can really, we can really give capacity building for them to upscale that model for  
**[0:12:35-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:12:35):**  all their production units.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:12:38):**  And then the third layer goes beyond, which we haven't launched yet, but it's the transition  
**[0:12:42-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:12:42):**  package where we are basically creating a toolbox of all the necessary steps for farmers  
**[0:12:50-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:12:50):**  to do the transition.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:12:52):**  So from seedlings and the materials and tools and also financial support and the knowledge  
**[0:12:58-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:12:58):**  from a regenerative ag to enable these farmers to go through this transition phase where  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:13:04):**  we want to launch this year.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:13:08):**  Just going back to your question about the corporates, like, I mean, it's the ones you  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:13:13):**  should have mentioned, we were talking to them like Timberland and then Veja and Espresso.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:13:19):**  You know, what's interesting that most of them, they are really like struggling with  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:13:24):**  the climate and resilience within their crops.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:13:28):**  Like in Espresso, for instance, they have like 1,200 farmers, which are really decreasing  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:13:33):**  their production of coffee in Brazil, mainly because of the high desertification happening  
**[0:13:39-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:13:39):**  in that region.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:13:40):**  And they really need to change fast the way coffee is being produced.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:13:44):**  So most of them, they come to us with like, you know, mentioning their challenges.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:13:50):**  And I think now it's growing, of course, there's a lot of challenges.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:13:53):**  Like I went to pitch in Adidas, for example, here in Harlem.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:13:56):**  And you know, they have such a huge supply chain that she doesn't even know that, you  
**[0:14:02-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:14:02):**  know, cotton was coming for their production units and for their clothes and everything.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:14:09):**  The woman even said, oh, you should talk to someone then in Bangkok, which is actually  
**[0:14:14-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:14:14):**  producing the cotton because we really don't know what's going on there.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:14:19):**  So there is a huge gap in the supply chain and most of sustainability efforts is going  
**[0:14:23-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:14:23):**  to the end of supply chain, like reusing, recycling and not really looking to the root  
**[0:14:27-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:14:27):**  cause, which is the soil.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:14:28):**  So it's a big challenge to convince the stakeholders.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:14:33):**  And just to paint a picture, because I think it's time we dive a bit deeper into agroforestry  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:14:38):**  and tropic agroforestry or advanced agroforestry, what you're doing.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:14:42):**  Let's take the case of the coffee farmers.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:14:44):**  You're saying their big challenge is justification and soil degeneration, basically.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:14:50):**  What would a regenerative agroforestry coffee system look like and how would that compare  
**[0:14:56-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:14:56):**  to a non regenerative one?  
**[0:14:58-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:14:58):**  And in this case, it's annoying that we're on a podcast and we cannot show any pictures,  
**[0:15:01-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:15:01):**  but so be as visual as possible.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:15:03):**  What would be the difference between a regenerative coffee system, coffee producing system and  
**[0:15:08-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:15:08):**  a non regenerative and extractive one?  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:15:11):**  Well, that's very good.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:15:13):**  So the traditional coffee plantation is a, it's only coffee in rows and where you pass  
**[0:15:20-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:15:20):**  with the machine and you can harvest them, you can pass and inject the pesticides, fertilizers.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:15:27):**  So it's basically a monoculture of coffee.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:15:29):**  And then the regenerative agroforestry coffee farm we're doing in Brazil, it's a 10 hectares  
**[0:15:34-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:15:34):**  we already started and then it's going to reach 200 by 2022.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:15:40):**  It's basically rows of coffee that we planted and we planted banana in the same rows so  
**[0:15:48-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:15:48):**  that it can provide shade in the beginning of the coffee growth.  
**[0:15:54-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:15:54):**  And then in the same rows, you also have peanuts to help also with nitrogen fixing and also  
**[0:16:02-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:16:02):**  with providing another source of income for the farmer.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:16:05):**  And then in the other rows, between these rows of coffee, then you have African mahogany  
**[0:16:13-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:16:13):**  and also you have macadamia.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:16:16):**  And so you can spread the diversity into African mahogany to cut the wood from three to five  
**[0:16:25-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:16:25):**  years time so that you can use for wood chips to fill in the rows of the coffee to become  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:16:34):**  as fast as possible independent from external inputs.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:16:38):**  And so that you can really use this as a biomass cover in the crops of coffee and also provide  
**[0:16:44-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:16:44):**  shade through time.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:16:46):**  And the macadamia is an excellent revenue crop that it can give a lot of good source  
**[0:16:54-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:16:54):**  of income in the long term for the farmers.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:16:57):**  So we prospect each revenue streams and how long it will take to harvest each of these  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:17:04):**  major species in the design so that the farmer can distribute that along his market.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:17:10):**  Yes, for some farmers, it's like a logistic breakdown, but some farmers that are willing  
**[0:17:17-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:17:17):**  to adopt these practices, they can actually generate two times as profit as the conventional.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:17:23):**  And they can even with even having less trees of coffee in one piece of hectare, they can  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:17:30):**  even have a higher yield of coffee in the conventional.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:17:34):**  What about the yield, but coffee is a shade tree at the end and produces better, seems  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:17:41):**  to be producing better, at least in your examples, in a, let's say, more nurturing environment  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:17:46):**  than it is a monoculture kept alive by a lot of spraying and a lot of preying, probably.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:17:51):**  So the yields are as good and maybe and potentially even better just on the coffee case, which  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:17:56):**  means that all the others are basically extra cash flow.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:18:00):**  Exactly.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:18:01):**  Exactly.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:18:02):**  And maybe that's also one of the reasons why it's growing so fast in Brazil, because everything  
**[0:18:05-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:18:05):**  grows fast.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:18:06):**  But in these cases with with trees and with these kind of crops, it seems to be that region  
**[0:18:10-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:18:10):**  egg makes even more sense compared to highly mechanized grain, et cetera, where we still  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:18:16):**  where we're definitely we don't have those same margins and the same possibilities to  
**[0:18:21-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:18:21):**  easily switch or to easily transition.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:18:23):**  Exactly.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:18:24):**  Exactly.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:18:25):**  Like another reason why Minas Gerais in Brazil in the Serrado region, where now soybeans  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:18:31):**  took over, you know, the reason why coffee start like becoming less attractive business  
**[0:18:36-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:18:36):**  is because soybean has been expanded and subsidies for soybean has been growing from the government.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:18:43):**  And coffee actually now we are bringing this economic value of it back so that we can also  
**[0:18:52-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:18:52):**  create like a good business proposition for farmers in that region, which is massively  
**[0:18:58-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:18:58):**  deforesting for soybean practices.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:19:00):**  So it's an interesting case where the coffee, yes, needs shade.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:19:04):**  The same with cacao.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:19:06):**  And it's still having less freeze of coffee and cacao in the same amount of land.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:19:11):**  You can actually yield more.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:19:12):**  So it's a yeah, it's those are two crops that has a very successful results, of course,  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:19:17):**  with other kind of like crops, as you can know, with the grains.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:19:22):**  And there's more challenging there.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:19:24):**  And what do you see as the biggest barriers for, let's say, this advanced type of agroforestry  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:19:29):**  with many different crops, many different cash flows, management, etc.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:19:33):**  What are the biggest barriers for it to really take off if the potential and the margins  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:19:38):**  and the profits and also the let's say the resilience is so much better for the farmer?  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:19:43):**  What is holding it back to really spread fast and even faster in Brazil as it's doing that?  
**[0:19:48-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:19:48):**  So basically, I think it's really like the mindset of like understanding that even having  
**[0:19:55-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:19:55):**  less freeze of the major commodity the farmers producing for the company and having other  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:20:02):**  species will benefit their major commodity that they're selling to the company.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:20:06):**  So it's really about understanding that complexity can help them in the process to generate more  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:20:13):**  revenues in the long term and also ensure food security because most of these farmers  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:20:17):**  growing in monoculture fields, these crops, they buy industrialized food and then they  
**[0:20:22-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:20:22):**  get sick.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:20:23):**  They go to hospitals.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:20:24):**  Their children are not motivated anymore to keep farming and they move to cities.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:20:31):**  And I think the KPI of agroforestry is literally on the food security component because they  
**[0:20:37-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:20:37):**  also can eat, feed from their own farm and also like decrease external input costs which  
**[0:20:44-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:20:44):**  organic still relies on as well from organic manure and conventional from agrochemicals.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:20:51):**  And that's the beauty of complexity.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:20:55):**  But of course, not all the farmers are willing to do the high complex systems.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:20:59):**  So we as Renature, we design regenerative agroforestry systems based on also like how  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:07):**  to adopt that to the reality of the farmer.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:10):**  So sometimes very simple systems with two to four species maybe and then some were really  
**[0:21:18-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:18):**  complex with over 100.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:20):**  So it really depends.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:22):**  Systems with over 100?  
**[0:21:24-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:25):**  That's quite interesting.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:26):**  That's really pushing the boundaries of what we think as a companion cropping.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:31):**  Indeed.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:32):**  Must look like a forest basically, like a jungle.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:34):**  Literally and the best coffee of the year this year was announced and then it's actually  
**[0:21:40-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:40):**  coming from a centropic farm which is extremely complex with over 200 species or something.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:44):**  Wow.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:45):**  Yeah, I saw it on LinkedIn.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:46):**  I will try to make sure to link it below.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:48):**  I think you shared something on LinkedIn on that which is of course an absolute fundamental  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:53):**  piece.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:54):**  Like it has to be good food.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:55):**  It has to be good coffee.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:56):**  It has to translate into quality because otherwise the corporates or the niche players, the niche  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:22:02):**  brands that are diving onto regen are not going to keep doing it.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:22:06):**  I mean if it leads to, it's great if it leads to yield, better margins, etc.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:22:09):**  But if it doesn't translate into quality, we're not going to win this war.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:22:13):**  So it's great to see that it actually translates already into amazing coffee and it's winning  
**[0:22:19-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:22:19):**  prizes.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:22:20):**  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:22:21):**  Which helps the complexity helps with that, obviously.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:22:24):**  Indeed, indeed.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:22:25):**  And of course not everyone wants to adopt the complexity of the systems.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:22:30):**  But I think that as you know, like for example, the soybean case in Brazil, there is a soybean  
**[0:22:36-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:22:36):**  farm being done there.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:22:38):**  Of course it was only soybean monoculture field and now they are integrating only one  
**[0:22:42-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:22:42):**  more species called Mombasa grass.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:22:45):**  And this Mombasa grass is a very thick and very like a deep root type of grass which  
**[0:22:51-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:22:51):**  is very fast grown.  
**[0:22:53-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:22:53):**  And then it can slowly start reducing their input costs and uses a cover crop to be more  
**[0:23:01-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:23:01):**  climate resilient soybean and have a more long term soil fertility in the end.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:23:07):**  Only one more species allow these farmers to think, oh, so if this Mombasa grass helped  
**[0:23:12-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:23:12):**  us, maybe another species can also help us.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:23:15):**  And they are already planting some African mahogany, but not in the same row, but a bit  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:23:22):**  distant to kind of also see what could be the role of African mahogany to help them.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:23:27):**  So it's, you know, slowly from simplicity or to complexity, they can understand the  
**[0:23:34-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:23:34):**  process of the...  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:23:35):**  It's a slow journey, but once they're going on it, then it's very difficult to go back  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:23:40):**  and basically continue to add, because I've had discussions with people on cover crops  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:23:44):**  and they started with two or three types and now they're going to 15 different types or  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:23:49):**  20.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:23:50):**  And basically keep saying it has to be more complex to fill all the gaps and to help them.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:23:54):**  And they are going to mixes, to amounts of diversity of mixes and complex mixes that  
**[0:23:59-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:23:59):**  they maybe five years ago thought were absolutely impossible.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:24:02):**  Like why would you put so many, but they all have a role.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:24:04):**  And like it's a continuous journey, which is great for I think us in the sector to see  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:24:08):**  that farmers are really innovating there and really pushing the boundaries of things that  
**[0:24:12-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:24:12):**  we didn't know were possible.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:24:14):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:24:16):**  And in terms of ReNature as a company and on the investment side of things, so where  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:24:20):**  are you as a company now?  
**[0:24:23-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:24:23):**  You've been around for a number of years.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:24:24):**  You are getting into a very interesting phase.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:24:26):**  You've worked with a number of very interesting companies.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:24:28):**  You're in negotiation with a whole group of others.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:24:31):**  Where would you say it's the end of January, 2020, where are you now and where would you  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:24:35):**  like to be like, let's say in a year from now, we'll be talking.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:24:39):**  Perfect.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:24:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:24:41):**  So basically at the moment we are at least having one model farm done for each major  
**[0:24:50-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:24:50):**  commodity, which is causing the first station globally.  
**[0:24:53-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:24:53):**  So we're looking to palm oil, cacao, coffee, cotton, timber, rubber, and also soybean.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:25:02):**  And then we basically want to have a really proof of concept for economical feasibility  
**[0:25:08-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:25:08):**  of these designs.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:25:10):**  And then we aim at having a transition package, which can target thousands of farmers that  
**[0:25:17-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:25:17):**  are working this supply chain.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:25:20):**  So that we can really come with this transition packages to corporates and also impact investors  
**[0:25:25-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:25:25):**  and banks to give micro loans for this transition to happen in a larger amount of farmers involved.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:25:34):**  And so now we have enough data on at least four of these eight target commodities we're  
**[0:25:41-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:25:41):**  looking to.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:25:42):**  The other four we still need to dig more research into it.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:25:46):**  And so we are already scaling the ones that we have, we get enough data and the ones that  
**[0:25:52-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:25:52):**  we still have to work on, we still in this pilot phase with like a soybean and grains  
**[0:25:59-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:25:59):**  mostly.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:00):**  And so, yeah, at the moment our final goal is to really get this proof of the successful  
**[0:26:09-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:09):**  stories in the scale and then still get more data on the ones that needs to be more robust  
**[0:26:18-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:18):**  so that we can scale that in the future as well.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:21):**  And you're also looking to scale the company.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:24):**  You're six people now.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:25):**  And where would you be like at the end of this year?  
**[0:26:28-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:28):**  Where would you like to be, obviously?  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:30):**  Where would you like to be at the end of this year in terms of in terms of people and in  
**[0:26:34-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:34):**  terms of basically projects on the ground?  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:37):**  So we are now six, as you said.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:39):**  Basically, we got the seed investment from Meraki with Fernando, which is your good friend.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:46):**  And we will be in the podcast soon.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:49):**  I know you're listening, Fernando.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:50):**  We have to plan that.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:51):**  Nice.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:52):**  Good.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:53):**  Good.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:54):**  And then, yeah, now then we're going for the next round also now.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:57):**  And so we so the next round of investment we're looking is also for increasing staff  
**[0:27:04-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:27:04):**  because most of our cost is really on staff, basically.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:27:08):**  So we want to expand for this year for 14 people, including more experts, including  
**[0:27:13-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:27:13):**  and also a fund raise managers, also like more banking background people so that we  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:27:21):**  can also having more experts in the financial side because we are very good with implementing  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:27:27):**  projects and also communicating them, marketing, but and measuring impact.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:27:33):**  But we're not very yet good enough with the having more like a more financial background  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:27:41):**  people like coming from banking and well, my dad comes from banking.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:27:46):**  So for us, for me, it would be interesting to have more people in that in segregation.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:27:53):**  Especially as we're going to the transition packet to towards the transition package in  
**[0:27:57-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:27:57):**  the different crops, it would be essential, obviously, to to work on that.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:28:01):**  So you'll be mostly looking to scale the company to serve more of the customers you have and  
**[0:28:07-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:28:07):**  then obviously to continue to collect data on the main deforestation causing crops that  
**[0:28:13-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:28:13):**  you don't have, if you don't feel comfortable that you have enough data yet.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:28:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:28:18):**  And in general, if you would look at, let's say, the impact investing world, who you know  
**[0:28:22-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:28:22):**  quite well, you see it, I at least see a lot of interest in in regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:28:28):**  in forestry and agroforestry.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:28:31):**  What would you tell investors?  
**[0:28:33-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:28:33):**  What they should what should they read?  
**[0:28:35-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:28:35):**  Where should they start?  
**[0:28:36-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:28:36):**  What should they dive into?  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:28:37):**  What should they discover more when they want to make investments in the space in the broadest  
**[0:28:42-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:28:42):**  scale of the world of RegenEgg?  
**[0:28:45-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:28:45):**  What would you advise them to do first?  
**[0:28:47-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:28:47):**  Perfect.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:28:48):**  Just just going quickly, like into a point like because at the moment, we have been receiving  
**[0:28:54-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:28:54):**  like many proposals from like farmers communities around the globe, like from China to Hawaii.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:29:01):**  So we have received around like 50 to 60.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:29:05):**  But 85% of these proposals we have received of farmers saying, hey, can you guys help  
**[0:29:10-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:29:10):**  us?  
**[0:29:11-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:29:11):**  It's mostly they don't have a budget.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:29:13):**  So they expect us, Renature, to come with this with the financial injection.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:29:19):**  And 15 only comes from these corporates like Verstehe, Far Farm and Espresso that they  
**[0:29:26-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:29:26):**  have the financial already in place to foreign nations.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:29:30):**  So all this 85%, we're aiming at working with the blended finance instruments.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:29:36):**  So like bringing a letter of intention from a company like Veja, for instance, saying,  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:29:42):**  hey, we are willing to buy the cotton and rubber coming from Renature Agroforestry Farms.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:29:47):**  And then we come with this letter to the impact investor to pay perhaps half of the investment  
**[0:29:54-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:29:54):**  and then having another player to play the other half.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:29:58):**  So you can finance, co-finance these projects which doesn't have the budget in place.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:30:05):**  Some of them, they have ROY.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:30:07):**  Some of them they don't.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:30:08):**  So it really depends.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:30:09):**  But going back to your question about the impact investors, what I would kind of like,  
**[0:30:16-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:30:16):**  yeah, as given insight of how we could play a role in this role, I think it's really about  
**[0:30:23-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:30:23):**  like understanding also like that regenerative ag and agroforestry is not like input-based  
**[0:30:30-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:30:30):**  agriculture.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:30:31):**  It's a knowledge-based agriculture.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:30:34):**  So that means that we are bringing the capabilities for farmers to become more resilient and more  
**[0:30:41-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:30:41):**  also self-independent from external resources.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:30:48):**  So that said, it's really about like understanding that the role of consultancy of the expertise  
**[0:30:54-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:30:54):**  in this role of regenerative ag and agroforestry, it's a key role to play to advise corporates  
**[0:31:01-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:31:01):**  and companies to do the transition.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:31:03):**  And most of investors, they are really afraid of this world of consultancy and advice.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:31:09):**  But it is something that is extremely necessary at the moment of where we are in this transition  
**[0:31:15-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:31:15):**  from conventional to regenerative.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:31:19):**  And yeah, so that's one.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:31:21):**  And two is also to kind of see that there are companies like Veja that are willing to  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:31:29):**  transition and they come with these letters of intention to do transition.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:31:34):**  And they are already working with like hundreds or even thousands of farmers that produce  
**[0:31:38-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:31:38):**  their major commodity.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:31:41):**  And you, as our impact investors in this world of investment could also look into opportunities  
**[0:31:48-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:31:48):**  to play a role there.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:31:50):**  One is a project base and one is also the role of consultancy and work with the knowledge  
**[0:31:58-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:31:58):**  transfer.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:31:59):**  And it's a follow-up question I'd like to ask.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:32:02):**  What if you would be the investor?  
**[0:32:04-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:32:04):**  Let's say you're in charge of an investment fund.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:32:07):**  So it's definitely on the investment side of things of $1 billion, which is an insane  
**[0:32:12-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:32:12):**  large amount.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:32:13):**  And I don't think any of us will be in charge of that anytime soon.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:32:17):**  But I think this space will attract a lot of finance in the next years.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:32:20):**  And we in the sector need to be ready to absorb that.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:32:22):**  We need to have the infrastructure, the ideas and the mindset to deal with all those zeros,  
**[0:32:27-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:32:27):**  basically.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:32:28):**  So if you tomorrow morning would wake up and you're in charge of an investment fund this  
**[0:32:32-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:32:32):**  size, what would you do?  
**[0:32:34-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:32:34):**  How would you invest it?  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:32:35):**  How would you spread it to the best of your knowledge, obviously, to look for both a financial  
**[0:32:39-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:32:39):**  but definitely also an impact return?  
**[0:32:41-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:32:41):**  Okay, so basically what we would do is we would set up a one center of kind of like  
**[0:32:49-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:32:49):**  a university type of school type for each continent so that really the farmers, they  
**[0:32:57-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:32:57):**  can go there and learn from this regenerative ag practices.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:33:06):**  And with these schools, you can host not just people to learn, like farmers and communities  
**[0:33:12-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:33:12):**  and the fraction years, but also you can host a potential partner corporates that they can  
**[0:33:24-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:33:24):**  outsource from the same cooperative of farmers.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:33:27):**  So what do I mean by that?  
**[0:33:28-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:33:28):**  For example, if Timberland needs cotton and vision needs cotton and they're both with  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:33:32):**  the same intentions of bringing regenerative ag as a mainstream.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:33:37):**  So cotton can be very well designed with Moringa, for instance.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:33:43):**  So if you have also a different company working with Moringa, then you can collect this collaboration  
**[0:33:49-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:33:49):**  between different corporates into the same landscape design.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:33:53):**  So what do I mean by that?  
**[0:33:55-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:33:55):**  It's bringing the 17th SDG of partnership for the goals between corporates to get their  
**[0:34:01-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:34:01):**  major crops and commodities outsourcing from the same amount of landscape.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:34:04):**  So you can diversify them and for making a design which makes sense for the species and  
**[0:34:11-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:34:11):**  then outsource this for corporates.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:34:13):**  And they come to the center to exchange their needs as partners.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:34:21):**  And then the fraction years farmers and communities, they can collaborate with giving them their  
**[0:34:26-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:34:26):**  inputs of the learnings from these models.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:34:30):**  And I think this way we can really speed up the process of regeneration globally, because  
**[0:34:34-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:34:34):**  then we can really start making a more efficient use of landscape worldwide.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:34:40):**  And then these farmers, they can really get food secure and having more motivation to  
**[0:34:44-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:34:44):**  keep farming and restoring soil.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:34:47):**  I think it's a very interesting approach.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:34:48):**  It made me think of, I think it's called the rotation or he called it the rotation risotto  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:34:53):**  that Dan Barber, Chef Dan Barber made, because he was saying, I want to take all the other  
**[0:34:58-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:34:58):**  crops of the rotation, not just the grain that we of course take, but to keep the soil  
**[0:35:02-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:35:02):**  growing, you need X amount of other crops to have a rotation and to actually grow this  
**[0:35:06-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:35:06):**  very, very precious Dan Barber grain, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:35:10):**  So I'm not going to use the grain.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:35:11):**  I'm going to use all the other crops and make a risotto out of that, make a plate to celebrate  
**[0:35:14-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:35:14):**  the rotation.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:35:15):**  We have to think in rotations and we have to think in whole landscapes.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:35:18):**  And that probably is more than just thinking in cotton or just thinking in Moringa or just  
**[0:35:22-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:35:22):**  in this case, it's definitely one plus one is much more than two.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:35:26):**  And one plus, if you go to 200 different crops, you get very complicated, but very interesting.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:35:31):**  That's a very interesting, interesting approach.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:35:33):**  And if you could change one thing, so stepping down from your investor role, if you could  
**[0:35:37-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:35:37):**  change one thing overnight, tomorrow morning we wake up and you have changed one thing  
**[0:35:40-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:35:40):**  in the food and ag space, what would it be?  
**[0:35:44-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:35:44):**  Well for me, like what I would particularly change in the food and ag world, it's how  
**[0:35:49-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:35:49):**  we dialogue with farmers.  
**[0:35:54-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:35:54):**  I think the way we're talking to them, it's still, it's more like we're still bringing  
**[0:36:02-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:36:02):**  something for them instead of really like listening to them.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:36:07):**  And I think the role they have, it's extremely important to decide also in the design of  
**[0:36:12-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:36:12):**  the systems, because I have seen a lot of people on the ground thinking that it's the  
**[0:36:20-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:36:20):**  way it should be, like with the return of the value and experts, but it's really about  
**[0:36:27-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:36:27):**  absorbing their knowledge also to incorporate into design.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:36:32):**  For example, in Indonesia, we sat down with these farmers to understand what they would  
**[0:36:36-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:36:36):**  like to eat as well.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:36:38):**  And then we can incorporate that, they feel ownership of the land.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:36:41):**  So they can really be motivated like for all their life and with their children also to  
**[0:36:46-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:36:46):**  keep doing what they're doing.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:36:47):**  So the communication and the dialogue with farmers is something I would like to change.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:36:53):**  I think it's an excellent answer.  
**[0:36:55-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:36:55):**  I don't think anybody mentioned it so far, which it's a crucial piece.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:36:59):**  We've had discussions about it in the podcast and outside the podcast of obviously our view  
**[0:37:04-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:37:04):**  towards farmers that they happily are mining their soils and they should know better and  
**[0:37:09-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:37:09):**  they should do this and they should do that and they should do that, et cetera, et cetera,  
**[0:37:12-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:37:12):**  et cetera.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:37:13):**  At the end of the day, they're working extremely hard in the current system, which we all created  
**[0:37:18-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:37:18):**  and we should all take ownership for.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:37:20):**  And getting out of this mess definitely requires partnering with farmers and sitting down with  
**[0:37:25-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:37:25):**  farmers and actually having a discussion why and how and what could happen instead of coming  
**[0:37:31-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:37:31):**  with your rule book of, okay, I would like this amount of commodity crops compared with  
**[0:37:36-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:37:36):**  this command.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:37:37):**  This is how region X should look like and you should do it, which is a very easy trap  
**[0:37:42-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:37:42):**  to fall into.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:37:43):**  But I think it's extremely dangerous because it has happened more than enough and it's  
**[0:37:47-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:37:47):**  the big part of the reason we're in this mess.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:37:50):**  So I really like the answer.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:37:52):**  And what do you believe to be true about region X that others also in and outside the space  
**[0:37:57-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:37:57):**  don't believe to be true?  
**[0:37:58-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:37:58):**  And this question comes from John Kemp, who often asks it in a slightly different way  
**[0:38:02-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:38:02):**  in his podcast.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:38:03):**  Well, my idea to be true is that trees doesn't always need to be in the design of the regenerative  
**[0:38:11-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:38:11):**  agro, but it will be better.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:38:13):**  I'm not saying it has to be because sometimes the farmer, as I said, doesn't want.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:38:21):**  But it always improve soil fertility, soil regeneration, soil carbon stock in every level  
**[0:38:28-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:38:28):**  you can imagine.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:38:30):**  Trees really have a role to play in the designing of landscapes and not every landscape, I mean,  
**[0:38:36-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:38:36):**  but most of landscapes, they really would appreciate to have a tree that can fulfill  
**[0:38:44-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:38:44):**  the needs.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:38:45):**  Because when you talk about tree, people think they think of just random trees, but there  
**[0:38:52-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:38:52):**  is trees that really have a fulfilling role to design within any kind of crop that you  
**[0:38:57-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:38:57):**  can imagine.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:38:58):**  So I think it's really about what to plant and where.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:39:02):**  And then we can talk if it's going to be a tree or if it's going to be a grass.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:39:05):**  But it's really about the importance of understanding the role of trees in the design of regenerative  
**[0:39:11-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:39:11):**  agro.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:39:12):**  And I feel like, but I don't know if I'm wrong here, that it's much easier in a country like  
**[0:39:17-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:39:17):**  Brazil or a country like Indonesia, where trees have always been, or until very recently,  
**[0:39:21-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:39:21):**  part of the landscape.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:39:22):**  But if you, and this is one of my final questions, I always say that I never do it, but if you  
**[0:39:27-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:39:27):**  move like the agroforestry discussion to more temperate climates, where our idea of trees,  
**[0:39:34-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:39:34):**  let's say in Western Europe is in a forest or in a park, and the idea of agriculture  
**[0:39:38-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:39:38):**  is neat rows of grain or neat rows of soil and very neat rows of commodity crops, what  
**[0:39:45-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:39:45):**  do you see happening in agroforestry outside the more tropical areas?  
**[0:39:48-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:39:48):**  And what excites you there in terms of, because you have put your company in Amsterdam for  
**[0:39:53-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:39:53):**  a reason and not in Brazil or in Indonesia.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:39:56):**  So what do you see the potential in, let's say Europe, America, Australia, in terms of  
**[0:40:02-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:40:02):**  advanced agroforestry?  
**[0:40:04-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:40:04):**  Well, basically, trees have always been in every climate.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:40:13):**  So of course, you see that trees, it has always a role to play.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:40:20):**  Most of these monoculture crops that you have here in temperate climates used to be some  
**[0:40:25-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:40:25):**  forests.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:40:26):**  So when you want to design these kind of crops that it has been designing here, like mostly  
**[0:40:33-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:40:33):**  for livestock, grains, you can always use trees to boost the soil regeneration process  
**[0:40:43-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:40:43):**  with pruning techniques and stuff like that.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:40:46):**  But it really depends.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:40:48):**  So we use a lot of willows, for example, here in the temperate climates, which is very good  
**[0:40:56-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:40:56):**  to also as a water resilient kind of a role in it for the soil.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:41:03):**  And it also grows really fast.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:41:05):**  So you can use the branches also for wood chips and then in the ground to cover crops.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:41:14):**  And I think there's a lot of designs being done in Greece with Mazi farm people, also  
**[0:41:18-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:41:18):**  in Spain with the La Loma Viva and also with Patrick Walmers from European Agroforestry  
**[0:41:27-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:41:27):**  Federation work being done across Europe.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:41:31):**  So I think there's some good cases in temperate climates that it needs to grow, of course.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:41:37):**  I think the EurAff has a goal to reach 50 farmers adopting Agroforestry by 2025, which  
**[0:41:44-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:41:44):**  is very ambitious and I like that.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:41:45):**  It doesn't sound very ambitious.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:41:48):**  Five zero, right?  
**[0:41:49-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:41:49):**  That doesn't sound very ambitious.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:41:50):**  True, true.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:41:51):**  It's the next five years.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:41:52):**  That's 10 years.  
**[0:41:53-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:41:53):**  Anyway, we'll get them on the podcast and explain why that's more than ambitious.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:42:01):**  But do you see the exciting things happening in Brazil with 200 different types?  
**[0:42:06-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:42:06):**  Is that something that the complex version, the very complex version, is that coming to,  
**[0:42:11-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:42:11):**  let's say, Europe yet or that's something we need to wait for?  
**[0:42:15-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:42:15):**  So that's the thing.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:42:16):**  There is very complex systems here in Europe, but they become more like a niche agroforestry  
**[0:42:22-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:42:22):**  for restaurants or for small plots.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:42:27):**  In scale, I don't see complexity having a role in it.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:42:30):**  I see more simplified systems as the Patrick Walmers have been there also working with.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:42:35):**  Sorry, you don't see a role for it or you don't see it yet, but it could potentially,  
**[0:42:40-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:42:40):**  complexity could play a role in the future.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:42:42):**  Could, but it's going to take longer and it really relies on the expectations from the  
**[0:42:48-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:42:48):**  farmers.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:42:49):**  So we as Renatio have a questionnaire for farmers and they can respond and how would  
**[0:42:53-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:42:53):**  they like to see their farm in the future.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:42:56):**  And then they can really kind of give estimation for us how complex, how simple they would  
**[0:43:00-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:43:00):**  like.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:43:01):**  But I think it will take time for that to kick off in complexity wise in Europe, in  
**[0:43:08-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:43:08):**  contemporary climate.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:43:10):**  It's going to get there slowly.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:43:12):**  And I think it's a process of simplifying the systems, which is more aesthetic, attractive  
**[0:43:18-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:43:18):**  for farmers to start adopting.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:43:19):**  And then you can get to the complex in the future.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:43:22):**  A bit like the soy farmer you mentioned that is putting in one extra, in this case, one  
**[0:43:28-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:43:28):**  extra grass, actually one extra crop, and then now starts thinking about trees and then  
**[0:43:31-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:43:31):**  slowly goes to more complex.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:43:34):**  Also because a lot of times the margins are very thin here.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:43:37):**  People are on extreme stress.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:43:39):**  So the risks, if you're, let's say your farmland, I mean the Netherlands now is extremely expensive.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:43:44):**  The risks you're running by introducing even one extra crop are enormous and they're very,  
**[0:43:50-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:43:50):**  very close to the edge constantly.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:43:51):**  So it's very understandable, very risk averse.  
**[0:43:55-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:43:55):**  But also another point that I thought of is because of the ecosystem services that you  
**[0:44:02-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:44:02):**  can actually abstract from more complex systems, it's higher.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:44:08):**  If the laws and regulations on the EU level can actually start giving credits to this  
**[0:44:14-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:44:14):**  ecosystem services faster than in emergent countries, it means that the complex systems  
**[0:44:20-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:44:20):**  can go faster here as well.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:44:23):**  So it can help to accelerate the process.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:44:28):**  Yeah, it can speed up the process.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:44:32):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:44:33):**  I want to thank you so much, Philippe, for your time and a fascinating insight in how  
**[0:44:38-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:44:38):**  to work with corporates, advanced agroforestry complexity.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:44:42):**  And I don't think it's the last time we chat, but thank you for this first one.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:44:46):**  And I'm looking forward to checking in how the growth and the scale up and all the model  
**[0:44:51-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:44:51):**  farms are going.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:44:52):**  Perfect.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:44:53):**  Thank you so much for inviting me.

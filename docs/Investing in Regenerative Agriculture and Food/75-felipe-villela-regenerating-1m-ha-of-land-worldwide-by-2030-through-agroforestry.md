**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:00:14):**  Join me for a discussion on advanced syntropic agroforestry and how to change the extractive  commodity crops causing deforestation through working with large corporates.  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:00:29):**  Everything as if the planet mattered.  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:00:40):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:50-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:00:50):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:01:03):**  In March last year we launched our Patreon community to make it easy for fans to support  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former

**[0:01:26-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:01:26):**  Thank you.  Today I'm joined by Felipe Filella, co-founder of ReNature, working to regenerate nature  through agroforestry.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:01:34):**  They work across the globe on crops like cacao, coffee, citrus fruits, white pepper,  rubber, leather and cotton.  Together with large corporates like Veja.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:01:42):**  Welcome Felipe.  Hi Kun, how is everything?  I'm very good.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:01:46):**  I'm looking forward to a conversation on advanced agroforestry, corporates, nutrient density,  trees and everything in between.  Perfect.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:01:55):**  Awesome.  No, that's great to be here.  Thank you so much for the invitation and looking forward also to share a bit more of ReNature  
**[0:02:02-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:02:02):**  and our work with the mission of reaching the one million hectares by 2030 for regenerated  land through regenerative agroforestry.  And yeah, looking forward to where it's going to lead us, this conversation.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:02:17):**  It's nice to be here.  Yeah.  So start with a question about you.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:02:21):**  What brings you to Amsterdam?  You're based in Amsterdam, but a lot of the agroforestry work you're doing is around the  globe.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:02:27):**  And what brings you to agroforestry?  Perfect.  And so first of all, I was raised in a family that has been working with one thousand five  
**[0:02:35-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:02:35):**  hundred hectares, large scale organic citrus farming in Brazil and was near Sao Paulo.  So actually my grandparent, he brought the lemon Thai tea species to Brazil.  And then basically they started doing citrus farming for a long time, over 60 years.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:02:56):**  And I was always involved in agriculture, organic agriculture.  And since my family gave me the conditions and also the possibility to explore around  the globe, other farms, I went to Africa, I went to the US, I went to Canada.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:03:13):**  And I saw there was a lot of challenges.  And I came back to Brazil thinking, hey, you know, I'm traveling all over the world.  I don't even know my own country really well.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:03:23):**  So I decided to go to the Amazon.  And I saw and I was amazed by the knowledge that the indigenous people inside Amazon,  they're, you know, treating nature and making everything from coming from the forest.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:03:38):**  And when I left the Amazon, I saw the massive deforestation for soybean, cattle ranching  and the logging industries.  And I was terrified by the way we are managing the natural resources in that region.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:03:50):**  And I thought like, how deep can we go?  I know we need to extract resources for commodity use for corporates, but how responsibly is  actually being done.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:04:00):**  So I came back home and I felt like, okay, I went to dig and visit every single agroforestry,  regenerative agriculture, organic agriculture.  You can name all the names, farms that can inspire me enough to see how we can actually  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:04:18):**  make a transition in a global perspective.  But basically there was a second trip around the world, but the first trip when your family  gave you the space to explore, did you visit the conventional chemical side of agriculture?  
**[0:04:31-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:04:31):**  Did you visit your organic side?  Did you visit the regenerative side?  What gave you, what did you explore and why?  
**[0:04:37-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:04:37):**  Yeah, very good question.  I basically went to dig into all these conventional traditional systems, but looking to like grains,  but also looking to a tropical, more like pipe cocoa, coffee, especially mostly.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:04:55):**  And I visualized the differences between the conventional organic and beyond organic kind  of regenerative more in line with agroforestry systems.  And the type of agriculture my family has been always working was organic, but I saw  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:05:09):**  that there was a lot of knowledge and science behind regenerative and agroforestry practices  that I went deeper into it.  And then I basically saw there was a lot of experts in the field and especially in Brazil.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:05:24):**  And one of the main reasons, because people in Brazil, they have been doing this for over  60 years.  And I was amazed by how much knowledge is there, but they don't have access to highly  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:05:35):**  impactful projects that could be developed from their side.  So why is Brazil such a hotbed of agroforestry and regenerative agriculture development?  And for people that don't know, definitely start Googling and start diving into it because  
**[0:05:52-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:05:52):**  there's so much happening there.  And the question is always why there?  And you're saying it's been doing for 60 years.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:05:57):**  So why in the last 60 years has so much been done on understanding these kinds of systems  involving very often trees?  Perfect.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:06:07):**  Yeah.  Well, in Brazil, if you dig into the KPIs, it's really on community development.  So people there, they really work collaboratively to bring cooperatives that they can communicate  
**[0:06:20-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:06:20):**  and then exchange their learnings.  And I think for being a very community type of culture there, things can disseminate easier  than in other cultures, which is more individualistic, let's say.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:06:36):**  And in Brazil, the knowledge of the agroforestry has been done also mostly because 85% of Brazil's  food security comes from smallholder farmers.  And these farmers, they always have been exchanging their experiences and learnings.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:06:52):**  And this has been something that really inspired the agroforestry and regenerative agriculture  movement to spread faster.  And I think in some other countries, it's still growing, but it hasn't been done faster  
**[0:07:05-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:07:05):**  as in Brazil at the moment.  And so you did this second tour, you went very deep into regenerative ag and agroforestry,  and then you decided to set up ReNature.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:07:14):**  How did that come about?  Perfect.  And so yeah, I saw there was a lot of knowledge and experts in the field on the ground.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:07:22):**  I myself wanted to go very deep into the knowledge of it.  But then I saw there was a really big gap between the dialogue of these experts with  companies that has in their supply chain more than hundreds or thousands of farmers that  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:07:40):**  are supplying them with their main commodities like coffee, palm oil, or soybean, or whatever.  And I spotted an opportunity to actually bring access of these experts to help these companies  and corporates to do the transition to regenerative ag and agroforestry systems.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:07:59):**  And we decided to start ReNature focusing on two major countries, Brazil and Indonesia,  mainly because of the highest deforestation rate was going too fast.  And then we kicked off in those two countries.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:08:13):**  And then from that on, we would be looking to other climates and also other countries.  So the biggest source of inspiration for starting ReNature was really how much deforestation  was actually being caused by agriculture and how knowledge of these experts in the field  
**[0:08:31-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:08:31):**  of regenerative ag and agroforestry is displaced and could be well incorporated into this corporate  sustainability targets of offsetting their footprint space.  Yeah, so basically you saw a lot of knowledge on the ground and you saw a lot of willingness  
**[0:08:48-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:08:48):**  of corporates to do something.  And maybe they even mentioned regenerative ag, or they mentioned their value change,  but as soon as they were dealing with thousands or hundreds of farmers, it became very, very  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:08:59):**  difficult to manage that and to implement some of these systems at scale.  So that's a great idea.  It's a great approach.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:09:06):**  How do you get into these corporates?  Because I think many people listening to this podcast would say, I would love to work with  Timbaland, or I would love to work with, name another huge company that has somehow food,  
**[0:09:15-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:09:15):**  fiber and oil in their supply chain.  How did you get into your first, I think it's on the journey, your first customer, your  first corporate?  
**[0:09:23-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:09:23):**  How did that happen?  Yeah, so the first two ones that as I mentioned, Brazil and Indonesia, was with Far Farm is  a company from New York, New York with regenerative fibers for the fashion industry.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:09:35):**  So we started like a cotton production in the Amazon in Para region as a replacement  for deforestation practices used for cassava flower.  And then we would help these communities.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:09:48):**  It's 40 families that were using, making cassava flower from deforestation.  And now they have a generation of income from the cotton and other natural fibers for the  fashion industry.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:10:01):**  So it's a small company that now are kind of changing the fashion industry slowly in  the, and then they were accelerated by a fashion for good here in Amsterdam.  And now they're also joining forces with Vision.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:10:16):**  And that's one of our potential partners also in the future, as you mentioned before.  And then Indonesia, we started with Versteegin, this Dutch company, which works with spices  and mainly pepper, onion, and turmeric and cinnamon.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:10:33):**  And then we're planting with them white pepper in the Banca Island.  We started as a pilot with of one hectare, what we call all the farm.  And then as soon as we showcase the impact metrics of the project in the ecosystem services  
**[0:10:49-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:10:49):**  perspective, but also in the social and economic, showing how much you could potentially reach.  And then they finance the scalability of this project.  And we started as a pilot model farm.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:11:02):**  And now as they obtain the results, they are willing to scale that for all the 500 farmers,  which is very interesting to see that there is the willingness to also scale this opportunities  of a regressive practices.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:11:16):**  And is this approach of a model farm then basically shown to the corporate what could  be done in agroforestry because everybody hears about it, but it's probably difficult  to imagine in my own supply chain.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:11:28):**  And then basically scaling, is that the model you're, I'm using model twice, is that the  model you're using and why are using that specific approach when it comes to big corporates  that could maybe also do a lot more at once if they wanted to?  
**[0:11:42-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:11:42):**  Yeah, no, indeed.  Like most of our proposals, we focus on developing either a model farm or a model school.  A model farm is one demonstration plot.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:11:54):**  It can vary from one hectare to 10 to 15 to 20, for example.  And this corporate can obtain the results of the impact that it's causing in the food  security element and also the soil regeneration, carbon sequestration, and then also the economical  
**[0:12:12-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:12:12):**  viability of the design.  And then we have the model school, which is basically as they obtain the results and they  are secure of the scale of this model, then they can build an infrastructure to host farmers  
**[0:12:27-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:12:27):**  and their agronomists.  So they can really, we can really give capacity building for them to upscale that model for  all their production units.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:12:38):**  And then the third layer goes beyond, which we haven't launched yet, but it's the transition  package where we are basically creating a toolbox of all the necessary steps for farmers  to do the transition.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:12:52):**  So from seedlings and the materials and tools and also financial support and the knowledge  from a regenerative ag to enable these farmers to go through this transition phase where  we want to launch this year.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:13:08):**  Just going back to your question about the corporates, like, I mean, it's the ones you  should have mentioned, we were talking to them like Timberland and then Veja and Espresso.  You know, what's interesting that most of them, they are really like struggling with  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:13:24):**  the climate and resilience within their crops.  Like in Espresso, for instance, they have like 1,200 farmers, which are really decreasing  their production of coffee in Brazil, mainly because of the high desertification happening  
**[0:13:39-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:13:39):**  in that region.  And they really need to change fast the way coffee is being produced.  So most of them, they come to us with like, you know, mentioning their challenges.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:13:50):**  And I think now it's growing, of course, there's a lot of challenges.  Like I went to pitch in Adidas, for example, here in Harlem.  And you know, they have such a huge supply chain that she doesn't even know that, you  
**[0:14:02-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:14:02):**  know, cotton was coming for their production units and for their clothes and everything.  The woman even said, oh, you should talk to someone then in Bangkok, which is actually  producing the cotton because we really don't know what's going on there.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:14:19):**  So there is a huge gap in the supply chain and most of sustainability efforts is going  to the end of supply chain, like reusing, recycling and not really looking to the root  cause, which is the soil.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:14:28):**  So it's a big challenge to convince the stakeholders.  And just to paint a picture, because I think it's time we dive a bit deeper into agroforestry  and tropic agroforestry or advanced agroforestry, what you're doing.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:14:42):**  Let's take the case of the coffee farmers.  You're saying their big challenge is justification and soil degeneration, basically.  What would a regenerative agroforestry coffee system look like and how would that compare  
**[0:14:56-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:14:56):**  to a non regenerative one?  And in this case, it's annoying that we're on a podcast and we cannot show any pictures,  but so be as visual as possible.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:15:03):**  What would be the difference between a regenerative coffee system, coffee producing system and  a non regenerative and extractive one?  Well, that's very good.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:15:13):**  So the traditional coffee plantation is a, it's only coffee in rows and where you pass  with the machine and you can harvest them, you can pass and inject the pesticides, fertilizers.  So it's basically a monoculture of coffee.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:15:29):**  And then the regenerative agroforestry coffee farm we're doing in Brazil, it's a 10 hectares  we already started and then it's going to reach 200 by 2022.  It's basically rows of coffee that we planted and we planted banana in the same rows so  
**[0:15:48-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:15:48):**  that it can provide shade in the beginning of the coffee growth.  And then in the same rows, you also have peanuts to help also with nitrogen fixing and also  with providing another source of income for the farmer.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:16:05):**  And then in the other rows, between these rows of coffee, then you have African mahogany  and also you have macadamia.  And so you can spread the diversity into African mahogany to cut the wood from three to five  
**[0:16:25-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:16:25):**  years time so that you can use for wood chips to fill in the rows of the coffee to become  as fast as possible independent from external inputs.  And so that you can really use this as a biomass cover in the crops of coffee and also provide  
**[0:16:44-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:16:44):**  shade through time.  And the macadamia is an excellent revenue crop that it can give a lot of good source  of income in the long term for the farmers.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:16:57):**  So we prospect each revenue streams and how long it will take to harvest each of these  major species in the design so that the farmer can distribute that along his market.  Yes, for some farmers, it's like a logistic breakdown, but some farmers that are willing  
**[0:17:17-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:17:17):**  to adopt these practices, they can actually generate two times as profit as the conventional.  And they can even with even having less trees of coffee in one piece of hectare, they can  even have a higher yield of coffee in the conventional.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:17:34):**  What about the yield, but coffee is a shade tree at the end and produces better, seems  to be producing better, at least in your examples, in a, let's say, more nurturing environment  than it is a monoculture kept alive by a lot of spraying and a lot of preying, probably.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:17:51):**  So the yields are as good and maybe and potentially even better just on the coffee case, which  means that all the others are basically extra cash flow.  Exactly.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:18:01):**  Exactly.  And maybe that's also one of the reasons why it's growing so fast in Brazil, because everything  grows fast.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:18:06):**  But in these cases with with trees and with these kind of crops, it seems to be that region  egg makes even more sense compared to highly mechanized grain, et cetera, where we still  where we're definitely we don't have those same margins and the same possibilities to  
**[0:18:21-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:18:21):**  easily switch or to easily transition.  Exactly.  Exactly.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:18:25):**  Like another reason why Minas Gerais in Brazil in the Serrado region, where now soybeans  took over, you know, the reason why coffee start like becoming less attractive business  is because soybean has been expanded and subsidies for soybean has been growing from the government.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:18:43):**  And coffee actually now we are bringing this economic value of it back so that we can also  create like a good business proposition for farmers in that region, which is massively  deforesting for soybean practices.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:19:00):**  So it's an interesting case where the coffee, yes, needs shade.  The same with cacao.  And it's still having less freeze of coffee and cacao in the same amount of land.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:19:11):**  You can actually yield more.  So it's a yeah, it's those are two crops that has a very successful results, of course,  with other kind of like crops, as you can know, with the grains.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:19:22):**  And there's more challenging there.  And what do you see as the biggest barriers for, let's say, this advanced type of agroforestry  with many different crops, many different cash flows, management, etc.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:19:33):**  What are the biggest barriers for it to really take off if the potential and the margins  and the profits and also the let's say the resilience is so much better for the farmer?  What is holding it back to really spread fast and even faster in Brazil as it's doing that?  
**[0:19:48-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:19:48):**  So basically, I think it's really like the mindset of like understanding that even having  less freeze of the major commodity the farmers producing for the company and having other  species will benefit their major commodity that they're selling to the company.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:20:06):**  So it's really about understanding that complexity can help them in the process to generate more  revenues in the long term and also ensure food security because most of these farmers  growing in monoculture fields, these crops, they buy industrialized food and then they  
**[0:20:22-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:20:22):**  get sick.  They go to hospitals.  Their children are not motivated anymore to keep farming and they move to cities.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:20:31):**  And I think the KPI of agroforestry is literally on the food security component because they  also can eat, feed from their own farm and also like decrease external input costs which  organic still relies on as well from organic manure and conventional from agrochemicals.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:20:51):**  And that's the beauty of complexity.  But of course, not all the farmers are willing to do the high complex systems.  So we as Renature, we design regenerative agroforestry systems based on also like how  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:07):**  to adopt that to the reality of the farmer.  So sometimes very simple systems with two to four species maybe and then some were really  complex with over 100.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:20):**  So it really depends.  Systems with over 100?  Yeah.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:25):**  That's quite interesting.  That's really pushing the boundaries of what we think as a companion cropping.  Yeah.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:31):**  Indeed.  Must look like a forest basically, like a jungle.  Literally and the best coffee of the year this year was announced and then it's actually  
**[0:21:40-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:40):**  coming from a centropic farm which is extremely complex with over 200 species or something.  Wow.  Yeah, I saw it on LinkedIn.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:46):**  I will try to make sure to link it below.  I think you shared something on LinkedIn on that which is of course an absolute fundamental  piece.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:21:54):**  Like it has to be good food.  It has to be good coffee.  It has to translate into quality because otherwise the corporates or the niche players, the niche  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:22:02):**  brands that are diving onto regen are not going to keep doing it.  I mean if it leads to, it's great if it leads to yield, better margins, etc.  But if it doesn't translate into quality, we're not going to win this war.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:22:13):**  So it's great to see that it actually translates already into amazing coffee and it's winning  prizes.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:22:21):**  Which helps the complexity helps with that, obviously.  Indeed, indeed.  And of course not everyone wants to adopt the complexity of the systems.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:22:30):**  But I think that as you know, like for example, the soybean case in Brazil, there is a soybean  farm being done there.  Of course it was only soybean monoculture field and now they are integrating only one  
**[0:22:42-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:22:42):**  more species called Mombasa grass.  And this Mombasa grass is a very thick and very like a deep root type of grass which  is very fast grown.  
**[0:22:53-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:22:53):**  And then it can slowly start reducing their input costs and uses a cover crop to be more  climate resilient soybean and have a more long term soil fertility in the end.  Only one more species allow these farmers to think, oh, so if this Mombasa grass helped  
**[0:23:12-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:23:12):**  us, maybe another species can also help us.  And they are already planting some African mahogany, but not in the same row, but a bit  distant to kind of also see what could be the role of African mahogany to help them.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:23:27):**  So it's, you know, slowly from simplicity or to complexity, they can understand the  process of the...  It's a slow journey, but once they're going on it, then it's very difficult to go back  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:23:40):**  and basically continue to add, because I've had discussions with people on cover crops  and they started with two or three types and now they're going to 15 different types or  20.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:23:50):**  And basically keep saying it has to be more complex to fill all the gaps and to help them.  And they are going to mixes, to amounts of diversity of mixes and complex mixes that  they maybe five years ago thought were absolutely impossible.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:24:02):**  Like why would you put so many, but they all have a role.  And like it's a continuous journey, which is great for I think us in the sector to see  that farmers are really innovating there and really pushing the boundaries of things that  
**[0:24:12-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:24:12):**  we didn't know were possible.  Yeah, exactly.  And in terms of ReNature as a company and on the investment side of things, so where  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:24:20):**  are you as a company now?  You've been around for a number of years.  You are getting into a very interesting phase.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:24:26):**  You've worked with a number of very interesting companies.  You're in negotiation with a whole group of others.  Where would you say it's the end of January, 2020, where are you now and where would you  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:24:35):**  like to be like, let's say in a year from now, we'll be talking.  Perfect.  Yeah.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:24:41):**  So basically at the moment we are at least having one model farm done for each major  commodity, which is causing the first station globally.  So we're looking to palm oil, cacao, coffee, cotton, timber, rubber, and also soybean.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:25:02):**  And then we basically want to have a really proof of concept for economical feasibility  of these designs.  And then we aim at having a transition package, which can target thousands of farmers that  
**[0:25:17-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:25:17):**  are working this supply chain.  So that we can really come with this transition packages to corporates and also impact investors  and banks to give micro loans for this transition to happen in a larger amount of farmers involved.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:25:34):**  And so now we have enough data on at least four of these eight target commodities we're  looking to.  The other four we still need to dig more research into it.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:25:46):**  And so we are already scaling the ones that we have, we get enough data and the ones that  we still have to work on, we still in this pilot phase with like a soybean and grains  mostly.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:00):**  And so, yeah, at the moment our final goal is to really get this proof of the successful  stories in the scale and then still get more data on the ones that needs to be more robust  so that we can scale that in the future as well.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:21):**  And you're also looking to scale the company.  You're six people now.  And where would you be like at the end of this year?  
**[0:26:28-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:28):**  Where would you like to be, obviously?  Where would you like to be at the end of this year in terms of in terms of people and in  terms of basically projects on the ground?  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:37):**  So we are now six, as you said.  Basically, we got the seed investment from Meraki with Fernando, which is your good friend.  And we will be in the podcast soon.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:49):**  I know you're listening, Fernando.  We have to plan that.  Nice.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:52):**  Good.  Good.  And then, yeah, now then we're going for the next round also now.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:26:57):**  And so we so the next round of investment we're looking is also for increasing staff  because most of our cost is really on staff, basically.  So we want to expand for this year for 14 people, including more experts, including  
**[0:27:13-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:27:13):**  and also a fund raise managers, also like more banking background people so that we  can also having more experts in the financial side because we are very good with implementing  projects and also communicating them, marketing, but and measuring impact.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:27:33):**  But we're not very yet good enough with the having more like a more financial background  people like coming from banking and well, my dad comes from banking.  So for us, for me, it would be interesting to have more people in that in segregation.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:27:53):**  Especially as we're going to the transition packet to towards the transition package in  the different crops, it would be essential, obviously, to to work on that.  So you'll be mostly looking to scale the company to serve more of the customers you have and  
**[0:28:07-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:28:07):**  then obviously to continue to collect data on the main deforestation causing crops that  you don't have, if you don't feel comfortable that you have enough data yet.  Yeah.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:28:18):**  And in general, if you would look at, let's say, the impact investing world, who you know  quite well, you see it, I at least see a lot of interest in in regenerative agriculture,  in forestry and agroforestry.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:28:31):**  What would you tell investors?  What they should what should they read?  Where should they start?  
**[0:28:36-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:28:36):**  What should they dive into?  What should they discover more when they want to make investments in the space in the broadest  scale of the world of RegenEgg?  
**[0:28:45-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:28:45):**  What would you advise them to do first?  Perfect.  Just just going quickly, like into a point like because at the moment, we have been receiving  
**[0:28:54-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:28:54):**  like many proposals from like farmers communities around the globe, like from China to Hawaii.  So we have received around like 50 to 60.  But 85% of these proposals we have received of farmers saying, hey, can you guys help  
**[0:29:10-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:29:10):**  us?  It's mostly they don't have a budget.  So they expect us, Renature, to come with this with the financial injection.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:29:19):**  And 15 only comes from these corporates like Verstehe, Far Farm and Espresso that they  have the financial already in place to foreign nations.  So all this 85%, we're aiming at working with the blended finance instruments.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:29:36):**  So like bringing a letter of intention from a company like Veja, for instance, saying,  hey, we are willing to buy the cotton and rubber coming from Renature Agroforestry Farms.  And then we come with this letter to the impact investor to pay perhaps half of the investment  
**[0:29:54-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:29:54):**  and then having another player to play the other half.  So you can finance, co-finance these projects which doesn't have the budget in place.  Some of them, they have ROY.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:30:07):**  Some of them they don't.  So it really depends.  But going back to your question about the impact investors, what I would kind of like,  
**[0:30:16-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:30:16):**  yeah, as given insight of how we could play a role in this role, I think it's really about  like understanding also like that regenerative ag and agroforestry is not like input-based  agriculture.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:30:31):**  It's a knowledge-based agriculture.  So that means that we are bringing the capabilities for farmers to become more resilient and more  also self-independent from external resources.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:30:48):**  So that said, it's really about like understanding that the role of consultancy of the expertise  in this role of regenerative ag and agroforestry, it's a key role to play to advise corporates  and companies to do the transition.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:31:03):**  And most of investors, they are really afraid of this world of consultancy and advice.  But it is something that is extremely necessary at the moment of where we are in this transition  from conventional to regenerative.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:31:19):**  And yeah, so that's one.  And two is also to kind of see that there are companies like Veja that are willing to  transition and they come with these letters of intention to do transition.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:31:34):**  And they are already working with like hundreds or even thousands of farmers that produce  their major commodity.  And you, as our impact investors in this world of investment could also look into opportunities  
**[0:31:48-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:31:48):**  to play a role there.  One is a project base and one is also the role of consultancy and work with the knowledge  transfer.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:31:59):**  And it's a follow-up question I'd like to ask.  What if you would be the investor?  Let's say you're in charge of an investment fund.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:32:07):**  So it's definitely on the investment side of things of $1 billion, which is an insane  large amount.  And I don't think any of us will be in charge of that anytime soon.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:32:17):**  But I think this space will attract a lot of finance in the next years.  And we in the sector need to be ready to absorb that.  We need to have the infrastructure, the ideas and the mindset to deal with all those zeros,  
**[0:32:27-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:32:27):**  basically.  So if you tomorrow morning would wake up and you're in charge of an investment fund this  size, what would you do?  
**[0:32:34-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:32:34):**  How would you invest it?  How would you spread it to the best of your knowledge, obviously, to look for both a financial  but definitely also an impact return?  
**[0:32:41-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:32:41):**  Okay, so basically what we would do is we would set up a one center of kind of like  a university type of school type for each continent so that really the farmers, they  can go there and learn from this regenerative ag practices.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:33:06):**  And with these schools, you can host not just people to learn, like farmers and communities  and the fraction years, but also you can host a potential partner corporates that they can  outsource from the same cooperative of farmers.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:33:27):**  So what do I mean by that?  For example, if Timberland needs cotton and vision needs cotton and they're both with  the same intentions of bringing regenerative ag as a mainstream.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:33:37):**  So cotton can be very well designed with Moringa, for instance.  So if you have also a different company working with Moringa, then you can collect this collaboration  between different corporates into the same landscape design.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:33:53):**  So what do I mean by that?  It's bringing the 17th SDG of partnership for the goals between corporates to get their  major crops and commodities outsourcing from the same amount of landscape.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:34:04):**  So you can diversify them and for making a design which makes sense for the species and  then outsource this for corporates.  And they come to the center to exchange their needs as partners.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:34:21):**  And then the fraction years farmers and communities, they can collaborate with giving them their  inputs of the learnings from these models.  And I think this way we can really speed up the process of regeneration globally, because  
**[0:34:34-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:34:34):**  then we can really start making a more efficient use of landscape worldwide.  And then these farmers, they can really get food secure and having more motivation to  keep farming and restoring soil.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:34:47):**  I think it's a very interesting approach.  It made me think of, I think it's called the rotation or he called it the rotation risotto  that Dan Barber, Chef Dan Barber made, because he was saying, I want to take all the other  
**[0:34:58-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:34:58):**  crops of the rotation, not just the grain that we of course take, but to keep the soil  growing, you need X amount of other crops to have a rotation and to actually grow this  very, very precious Dan Barber grain, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:35:10):**  So I'm not going to use the grain.  I'm going to use all the other crops and make a risotto out of that, make a plate to celebrate  the rotation.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:35:15):**  We have to think in rotations and we have to think in whole landscapes.  And that probably is more than just thinking in cotton or just thinking in Moringa or just  in this case, it's definitely one plus one is much more than two.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:35:26):**  And one plus, if you go to 200 different crops, you get very complicated, but very interesting.  That's a very interesting, interesting approach.  And if you could change one thing, so stepping down from your investor role, if you could  
**[0:35:37-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:35:37):**  change one thing overnight, tomorrow morning we wake up and you have changed one thing  in the food and ag space, what would it be?  Well for me, like what I would particularly change in the food and ag world, it's how  
**[0:35:49-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:35:49):**  we dialogue with farmers.  I think the way we're talking to them, it's still, it's more like we're still bringing  something for them instead of really like listening to them.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:36:07):**  And I think the role they have, it's extremely important to decide also in the design of  the systems, because I have seen a lot of people on the ground thinking that it's the  way it should be, like with the return of the value and experts, but it's really about  
**[0:36:27-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:36:27):**  absorbing their knowledge also to incorporate into design.  For example, in Indonesia, we sat down with these farmers to understand what they would  like to eat as well.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:36:38):**  And then we can incorporate that, they feel ownership of the land.  So they can really be motivated like for all their life and with their children also to  keep doing what they're doing.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:36:47):**  So the communication and the dialogue with farmers is something I would like to change.  I think it's an excellent answer.  I don't think anybody mentioned it so far, which it's a crucial piece.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:36:59):**  We've had discussions about it in the podcast and outside the podcast of obviously our view  towards farmers that they happily are mining their soils and they should know better and  they should do this and they should do that and they should do that, et cetera, et cetera,  
**[0:37:12-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:37:12):**  et cetera.  At the end of the day, they're working extremely hard in the current system, which we all created  and we should all take ownership for.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:37:20):**  And getting out of this mess definitely requires partnering with farmers and sitting down with  farmers and actually having a discussion why and how and what could happen instead of coming  with your rule book of, okay, I would like this amount of commodity crops compared with  
**[0:37:36-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:37:36):**  this command.  This is how region X should look like and you should do it, which is a very easy trap  to fall into.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:37:43):**  But I think it's extremely dangerous because it has happened more than enough and it's  the big part of the reason we're in this mess.  So I really like the answer.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:37:52):**  And what do you believe to be true about region X that others also in and outside the space  don't believe to be true?  And this question comes from John Kemp, who often asks it in a slightly different way  
**[0:38:02-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:38:02):**  in his podcast.  Well, my idea to be true is that trees doesn't always need to be in the design of the regenerative  agro, but it will be better.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:38:13):**  I'm not saying it has to be because sometimes the farmer, as I said, doesn't want.  But it always improve soil fertility, soil regeneration, soil carbon stock in every level  you can imagine.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:38:30):**  Trees really have a role to play in the designing of landscapes and not every landscape, I mean,  but most of landscapes, they really would appreciate to have a tree that can fulfill  the needs.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:38:45):**  Because when you talk about tree, people think they think of just random trees, but there  is trees that really have a fulfilling role to design within any kind of crop that you  can imagine.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:38:58):**  So I think it's really about what to plant and where.  And then we can talk if it's going to be a tree or if it's going to be a grass.  But it's really about the importance of understanding the role of trees in the design of regenerative  
**[0:39:11-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:39:11):**  agro.  And I feel like, but I don't know if I'm wrong here, that it's much easier in a country like  Brazil or a country like Indonesia, where trees have always been, or until very recently,  
**[0:39:21-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:39:21):**  part of the landscape.  But if you, and this is one of my final questions, I always say that I never do it, but if you  move like the agroforestry discussion to more temperate climates, where our idea of trees,  
**[0:39:34-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:39:34):**  let's say in Western Europe is in a forest or in a park, and the idea of agriculture  is neat rows of grain or neat rows of soil and very neat rows of commodity crops, what  do you see happening in agroforestry outside the more tropical areas?  
**[0:39:48-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:39:48):**  And what excites you there in terms of, because you have put your company in Amsterdam for  a reason and not in Brazil or in Indonesia.  So what do you see the potential in, let's say Europe, America, Australia, in terms of  
**[0:40:02-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:40:02):**  advanced agroforestry?  Well, basically, trees have always been in every climate.  So of course, you see that trees, it has always a role to play.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:40:20):**  Most of these monoculture crops that you have here in temperate climates used to be some  forests.  So when you want to design these kind of crops that it has been designing here, like mostly  
**[0:40:33-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:40:33):**  for livestock, grains, you can always use trees to boost the soil regeneration process  with pruning techniques and stuff like that.  But it really depends.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:40:48):**  So we use a lot of willows, for example, here in the temperate climates, which is very good  to also as a water resilient kind of a role in it for the soil.  And it also grows really fast.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:41:05):**  So you can use the branches also for wood chips and then in the ground to cover crops.  And I think there's a lot of designs being done in Greece with Mazi farm people, also  in Spain with the La Loma Viva and also with Patrick Walmers from European Agroforestry  
**[0:41:27-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:41:27):**  Federation work being done across Europe.  So I think there's some good cases in temperate climates that it needs to grow, of course.  I think the EurAff has a goal to reach 50 farmers adopting Agroforestry by 2025, which  
**[0:41:44-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:41:44):**  is very ambitious and I like that.  It doesn't sound very ambitious.  Five zero, right?  
**[0:41:49-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:41:49):**  That doesn't sound very ambitious.  True, true.  It's the next five years.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:41:52):**  That's 10 years.  Anyway, we'll get them on the podcast and explain why that's more than ambitious.  But do you see the exciting things happening in Brazil with 200 different types?  
**[0:42:06-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:42:06):**  Is that something that the complex version, the very complex version, is that coming to,  let's say, Europe yet or that's something we need to wait for?  So that's the thing.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:42:16):**  There is very complex systems here in Europe, but they become more like a niche agroforestry  for restaurants or for small plots.  In scale, I don't see complexity having a role in it.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:42:30):**  I see more simplified systems as the Patrick Walmers have been there also working with.  Sorry, you don't see a role for it or you don't see it yet, but it could potentially,  complexity could play a role in the future.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:42:42):**  Could, but it's going to take longer and it really relies on the expectations from the  farmers.  So we as Renatio have a questionnaire for farmers and they can respond and how would  
**[0:42:53-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:42:53):**  they like to see their farm in the future.  And then they can really kind of give estimation for us how complex, how simple they would  like.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:43:01):**  But I think it will take time for that to kick off in complexity wise in Europe, in  contemporary climate.  It's going to get there slowly.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:43:12):**  And I think it's a process of simplifying the systems, which is more aesthetic, attractive  for farmers to start adopting.  And then you can get to the complex in the future.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:43:22):**  A bit like the soy farmer you mentioned that is putting in one extra, in this case, one  extra grass, actually one extra crop, and then now starts thinking about trees and then  slowly goes to more complex.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:43:34):**  Also because a lot of times the margins are very thin here.  People are on extreme stress.  So the risks, if you're, let's say your farmland, I mean the Netherlands now is extremely expensive.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:43:44):**  The risks you're running by introducing even one extra crop are enormous and they're very,  very close to the edge constantly.  So it's very understandable, very risk averse.  
**[0:43:55-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:43:55):**  But also another point that I thought of is because of the ecosystem services that you  can actually abstract from more complex systems, it's higher.  If the laws and regulations on the EU level can actually start giving credits to this  
**[0:44:14-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:44:14):**  ecosystem services faster than in emergent countries, it means that the complex systems  can go faster here as well.  So it can help to accelerate the process.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:44:28):**  Yeah, it can speed up the process.  Absolutely.  I want to thank you so much, Philippe, for your time and a fascinating insight in how  
**[0:44:38-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:44:38):**  to work with corporates, advanced agroforestry complexity.  And I don't think it's the last time we chat, but thank you for this first one.  And I'm looking forward to checking in how the growth and the scale up and all the model  
**[0:44:51-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:44:51):**  farms are going.  Perfect.  Thank you so much for inviting me.

**[0:46:07-0:46:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:46:07):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:46:20):**  Why are we doing this course?  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question,  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  
**[0:46:30-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:46:30):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  How have we built our decision making framework?  
**[0:46:40-0:46:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:46:40):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees?  What questions should you ask?  
**[0:46:46-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:46:46):**  What is happening in the space?  What should you read?  What should you listen?  
**[0:46:50-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:46:50):**  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course?  
**[0:46:55-0:47:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:46:55):**  You the soil builders and investors in the space, the soil builders, people working in  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing,  platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line  
**[0:47:09-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:47:09):**  designers, holistic management consultants, et cetera, et cetera.  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  
**[0:47:21-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:47:21):**  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies,  et cetera.  Is this course free?  
**[0:47:29-0:47:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:47:29):**  No, this is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:47:42):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:47:51):**  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:48:00):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:48:15-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:48:15):**  if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:48:26):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:48:33):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/09/felipe-villela/#t=0:48:41):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.

**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:00:13):**  You will listen to an interview about food quality and the fact that some of the food  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:00:17):**  you buy, for example apples and spinach, have absolutely no nutrients in it.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:00:22):**  Even if you buy organic, even if you buy local, you're going to learn more about the immense  
**[0:00:27-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:00:27):**  challenges and opportunities of introducing quality back into the food system.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:00:35):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture â€“ Investing as if  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:00:39):**  the Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative  
**[0:00:43-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:00:43):**  food and agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate  
**[0:00:48-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:00:48):**  soil, people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:00:54):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:00:57):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:01-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:01:01):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:01:03):**  And it's time that we, as investors, big and small, and consumers, start paying much  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:01:08):**  more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:01:13):**  In March last year we launched our Patreon community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:17-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:01:17):**  our work.

**[0:01:36-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:01:36):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:01:38):**  Welcome to another interview.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:01:39):**  Today I'm interviewing Greg Schumacher, co-founder of Deke Origin, a biochemistry  
**[0:01:43-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:01:43):**  data company located in Boston.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:01:45):**  They enable people throughout the global food system to accurately answer critical questions  
**[0:01:50-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:01:50):**  like how is food changing throughout the supply chain and are we getting what we're paying  
**[0:01:54-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:01:54):**  for?  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:01:55):**  As most people know, I'm fascinated about the link between healthy soils, healthy produce,  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:01:59):**  healthy gut, healthy people, and especially if that leads to healthy ecosystems.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:02:03):**  So I think we have a lot to discuss.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:02:05):**  Welcome Greg.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:02:06):**  Thank you for having me.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:02:07):**  Nice to talk to you.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:02:08):**  To ask the personal question, what brings you into the food and agriculture space?  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:02:12):**  Oh boy.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:02:13):**  Well, I kind of stumbled into this space.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:02:14):**  I am not a farmer, not a chef.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:02:17):**  I don't have a food science background at all.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:02:19):**  I was living in China with my family, not for a number of years, but several years ago,  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:02:26):**  and started just thinking about what we were eating, what I was putting into my body and  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:02:31):**  what I was feeding my family.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:02:34):**  Sometimes it would have odd effects and I wouldn't know why.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:02:36):**  It would be so random and sometimes quite upsetting.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:02:41):**  And so I thought, hey, we live in a world now where the answers to any question seems  
**[0:02:48-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:02:48):**  like they're just a few keystrokes away.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:02:50):**  And so I started doing a little research into what am I eating and quickly discovered, man,  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:02:56):**  when you start asking that question, it just opens up Pandora's box and there aren't really  
**[0:03:01-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:03:01):**  any simple answers.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:03:02):**  In fact, there's just lots more questions.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:03:05):**  And so it became something that at the time was extremely frustrating for me.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:03:10):**  And then it's all of a sudden, I don't know, some moment in time happened and it became  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:03:16):**  sort of my life's work or my passion.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:03:20):**  I wanted to try to figure this out, you know, as stubborn as I might be.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:03:23):**  And so ever since then, I have been all in on trying to understand food and food systems.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:03:29):**  And that led you to co-found a biochemistry company.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:03:34):**  Can you explain a bit how you got to start TEEQ Origin?  
**[0:03:38-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:03:38):**  And I mean, it's a long story, but we'd love to know a bit about the background.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:03:42):**  And then obviously, we're going to talk about where you're now and where you're going.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:03:45):**  But let's see how you got to where you're now.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:03:48):**  When you realize, okay, it's not it's not just I'm not just a consumer, I actually want  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:03:51):**  to work and dedicate a lot of my time into this space.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:03:55):**  What did you do?  
**[0:03:56-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:03:56):**  Well, so I blame my daughter, who was 14 years old at the time.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:03:59):**  And she knew that I had an interest in this now.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:04:02):**  And sort of, you know, my new obsession was food safety and understanding food.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:04:07):**  And I just coincidentally happened to be working alongside Tesco manufacturing some consumer  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:04:12):**  products, including Android phones in and around China.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:04:16):**  And so I had that sort of lens on any way of making products.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:04:20):**  And my daughter came to me one day with this idea that she'd seen on the internet.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:04:24):**  And it was a Kickstarter campaign for a product called SIO.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:04:28):**  And SIO, maybe lots of your listeners already know it's been around for a while now, is  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:04:32):**  essentially a handheld spectrometer looks like a key fob, essentially shines light at  
**[0:04:37-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:04:37):**  organic material, it connects to a device, a phone, essentially via Bluetooth.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:04:43):**  And the idea is that it would scan this light, go up to a database, and it would return an  
**[0:04:47-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:04:47):**  answer to say, Hey, here's what this is.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:04:50):**  So hey, I've never seen anything like that before.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:04:52):**  I thought it was really cool.  
**[0:04:54-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:04:54):**  My longtime colleague who I work very closely with now for decades, I shared it with him.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:05:00):**  And we said, Wow, this is something really worth looking at.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:05:02):**  And again, because we have the lens of making Android phones and other consumer devices,  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:05:07):**  it sort of fit in along with this desire to understand food.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:05:12):**  So we looked into that a little bit deeper.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:05:13):**  And we quickly realized, hey, this is a great concept.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:05:16):**  But technically or scientifically speaking, hey, there's a lot of holes in it, because  
**[0:05:19-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:05:19):**  it sort of relied on consumers to crowdsource, you know, the data upload, hey, here's what  
**[0:05:25-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:05:25):**  I think I'm about to scan.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:05:27):**  And then I scan something and those two bits of information go up into the cloud.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:05:31):**  And so there's a lot of room for error.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:05:32):**  Obviously, I have to know what I'm scanning, I could gain the system, I could be wrong,  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:05:36):**  I could call it an apple and really, it's a pear.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:05:39):**  And so it was a great idea.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:05:41):**  But you know, that could be better.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:05:43):**  So what we thought is, hey, because we're working alongside this massive food company,  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:05:46):**  what if you could take the same concept, but you instead of relying on consumers or the  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:05:50):**  crowd to create these data sets, what if you could do it in the supply chain?  
**[0:05:55-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:05:55):**  What if you could do it either on the farm, or at least closer to the farm, and then move  
**[0:05:58-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:05:58):**  it forward to the consumer.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:06:00):**  And so basically, that's the sort of the journey we set out on to build something like that.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:06:05):**  And we actually built a number of prototypes into a phone and to a phone case that worked,  
**[0:06:11-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:06:11):**  believe it or not.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:06:12):**  But what we quickly discovered is one, there probably wasn't a market for that.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:06:15):**  And two, even if there was a market for that, there were no referential data sets, or there  
**[0:06:20-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:06:20):**  was no contextual information that you can access, even if you could build an instrument  
**[0:06:24-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:06:24):**  that would do what we were hoping to do, and others were hoping to do as well.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:06:28):**  So basically, there wasn't a way of I'm scanning my Apple, and then a device or software or  
**[0:06:34-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:06:34):**  whatever interface you use, could tell you this is good, or this is better than another  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:06:40):**  Apple you scanned maybe yesterday or another one you're scanning today.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:06:44):**  There was no context to the data that the scanner could provide.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:06:49):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:06:50):**  So there's a lot of devices out there today.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:06:52):**  And there's a lot of AI based companies that sort of make claim that the technology is  
**[0:06:57-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:06:57):**  able to do that, but it's impossible.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:06:59):**  Today, there's only one way to truly determine information about that Apple, and that is  
**[0:07:05-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:07:05):**  to test it in a lab.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:07:07):**  You have to send it off, and it has to be analyzed chemically.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:07:09):**  And once it's analyzed chemically, then you can say, okay, well, here's what's actually  
**[0:07:13-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:07:13):**  happening inside of that Apple.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:07:15):**  But without doing that, there are no magic devices or magic algorithms that could tell  
**[0:07:19-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:07:19):**  you that information without accessing that chemical analysis.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:07:22):**  Do you think there will be data sampling?  
**[0:07:24-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:07:24):**  So that's what we've created with Teak Origins.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:07:26):**  So essentially what we've done, and we can go back in time and talk a little bit more  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:07:30):**  about how we got from that stage to today, but essentially what we figured out now, and  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:07:34):**  it took us the good part of five or six years to do so, is that...  
**[0:07:39-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:07:39):**  So we'll take a food.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:07:40):**  Let's just stick with apples for the moment.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:07:41):**  We'll say, okay, we have an Apple.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:07:44):**  There may be 200 different things that you can measure about that Apple, but in reality,  
**[0:07:48-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:07:48):**  there's probably 10 things that matter the most.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:07:50):**  Hey, the moisture content and sugar and vitamin C and malic acid, maybe some antioxidants,  
**[0:07:57-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:07:57):**  but the other 190 plus things don't really matter.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:08:00):**  And so we'll take those handful of important things that matter.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:08:04):**  They don't really matter for, let's say, the Tesco, they don't really matter for me as  
**[0:08:08-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:08:08):**  a consumer, or they don't matter because they're connected to the others and the others function  
**[0:08:12-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:08:12):**  as a proxy.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:08:13):**  Yeah, a little bit of all of the above.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:08:15):**  They're just...  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:08:16):**  You think about Apple, hey, it's important to me as it's crisp, it's either sweet or  
**[0:08:21-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:08:21):**  tart depending on my taste.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:08:22):**  I'm eating it for most likely health purposes, so I want there to be some vitamins in there,  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:08:28):**  but there are probably some obscure minerals in there that one, almost are hard to detect  
**[0:08:33-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:08:33):**  and two, maybe don't really actually make a difference.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:08:36):**  So we had to start somewhere.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:08:38):**  So we say, again, for most foods, it's anywhere between eight and 20 individual things that  
**[0:08:43-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:08:43):**  we say, here's what's important, food.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:08:46):**  So we'll take that Apple and then we'll create what we call a critical composition profile.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:08:51):**  So here's what is important from a supply chain and here's what's important from a consumer  
**[0:08:54-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:08:54):**  standpoint and here are the individual components that make up these different things.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:09:00):**  And then we'll essentially deconstruct that Apple in our lab.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:09:03):**  So we have a full food laboratory here in Boston and we'll deconstruct each one of those  
**[0:09:09-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:09:09):**  analytes.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:09:10):**  So we'll look and test for vitamin C and moisture and sugar and whatever else we deem important.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:09:15):**  And we'll do that until we're satisfied that, hey, we know what apples look like from many  
**[0:09:21-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:09:21):**  different directions.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:09:22):**  And we'll do hundreds and hundreds of samples of that, just like any other food lab would  
**[0:09:25-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:09:25):**  do.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:09:26):**  And you would do that with one type of Apple or with all the different ones?  
**[0:09:29-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:09:29):**  It depends.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:09:30):**  So with apples, we have to do multiple varieties.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:09:32):**  In the case of blueberries and spinach, what we found so far is that you actually, blueberries  
**[0:09:37-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:09:37):**  are blueberry for the most part, whether it's grown in Maine here in the US or Chile or  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:09:42):**  in Spain, for the most part, a blueberry model works regardless of where it's grown.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:09:47):**  For apples, there's a lot of variability in the different types of cultivars.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:09:52):**  And so for apples, we have to get very specific for Braeburn or for Gala or for Fuji.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:09:57):**  And grapes, you would have a green grape model and you have a red grape model.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:10:00):**  So it all depends on the type of food.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:10:03):**  So once we've done the lab work, which is the part that most technology companies want  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:10:08):**  to skip because that's the hard part and the time consuming part.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:10:12):**  But we've done a deep dive now on apples.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:10:14):**  We take all that information and we essentially create a digital data model.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:10:19):**  So we digitize that information and we say, OK, we create two models.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:10:23):**  The first model is a classifier model.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:10:24):**  And that's the easy one.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:10:25):**  So we say, OK, based on all these different factors, we build a model that says, I'm going  
**[0:10:29-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:10:29):**  to take a handheld spectrometer off the shelf.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:10:32):**  So lots of companies make these things.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:10:34):**  And when I scan the piece of food using that classifier model, I'll be able to determine  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:10:39):**  without telling that device anything that, hey, this is an apple.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:10:43):**  If I've successfully done that, then it goes to the next model, which is a predictive model  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:10:48):**  that says, OK, now that I know it's an apple, I'm going to look at all the different things  
**[0:10:52-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:10:52):**  that we're measuring.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:10:53):**  I'm going to look at the moisture content and vitamin C and sugars and so on.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:10:56):**  And I'm going to make a prediction of the levels of those analytes inside of that particular  
**[0:11:02-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:11:02):**  apple.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:11:03):**  And I'm going to return to you individual scores of each one of those analytes.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:11:06):**  And I'm going to give you a combined score that says, here's the overall quality of that  
**[0:11:10-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:11:10):**  particular apple.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:11:12):**  So not apples in general, not the concept of an apple, but that actual apple in your  
**[0:11:15-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:11:15):**  hand.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:11:16):**  And that does it based on the spectrometer data that's getting out of the off the shelf  
**[0:11:23-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:11:23):**  device that you use?  
**[0:11:25-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:11:25):**  That's right.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:11:26):**  So we take a high fidelity lab model and we basically dumb it down, if you will, to a  
**[0:11:31-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:11:31):**  model that works on a field device.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:11:34):**  So you've essentially taken a low cost device that is out in the field, whether it's on  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:11:39):**  a farm or a retail store or ultimately maybe a consumer's hand.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:11:43):**  And you've made it as powerful as a spectrometer and other devices that normally you would  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:11:48):**  only find in the laboratory.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:11:50):**  And what does it serve?  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:11:52):**  Let's say me as a let's say I'm Tesco or a giant food retailer.  
**[0:11:58-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:11:58):**  Why would I want to know?  
**[0:11:59-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:11:59):**  I mean, why would I want to know that it's an apple?  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:12:02):**  Probably I can tell by myself, but especially the second part, what does it help me to do  
**[0:12:07-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:12:07):**  my job better?  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:12:08):**  Well, so today, you know, if lots of applications, so if I'm a retailer or if I'm anywhere in  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:12:13):**  the supply chain, there is, regardless of how sophisticated the company is, so whether  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:12:18):**  I'm Amazon on the far end of sophistication or I'm an average retailer on the low end  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:12:23):**  of sophistication, I essentially use the same methods to determine quality.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:12:28):**  I'll receive a shipment of apples or peaches or whatever, and I go through a very rudimentary  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:12:33):**  archaic way of determining is this what I ordered?  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:12:37):**  I maybe taste it, I smell it, I'll do some bricks testing, I'll feel it, you know, I'll  
**[0:12:43-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:12:43):**  tell me how old it is, I'll know what region it's from, what farm it's from.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:12:47):**  But it's art, it's not science.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:12:49):**  And so if you think about that, now I'm now the front lines of Tesco, to use your example,  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:12:55):**  for this multi-billion dollar retailer, and I'm using these archaic ways of determining  
**[0:13:00-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:13:00):**  quality and then it enters into my system and I have to get it through that system and  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:13:03):**  to use a consumer as fresh and as high quality as possible.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:13:07):**  Well, in reality, I have no idea what I just received, and therefore I have no idea what  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:13:12):**  I'm in turn selling you.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:13:14):**  And so when you actually take this technology that we developed and you scan that apple,  
**[0:13:18-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:13:18):**  you find out that it is oftentimes 25 or 50 X off of what the nutritional label says should  
**[0:13:26-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:13:26):**  be there.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:13:27):**  Wow.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:13:28):**  That's a lot.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:13:29):**  And we just assumed that the retailers knew that.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:13:31):**  And of course, as entrepreneurs, we're thinking, okay, well, Hey, you know, the proverbial  
**[0:13:34-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:13:34):**  man is out to get us as consumers.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:13:36):**  And then we quickly realized they had no idea this was news to the retailer.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:13:41):**  So people that have been in the industry their entire careers and have bought billions and  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:13:45):**  billions of dollars or pounds or euros worth of produce, or meat or anything else have  
**[0:13:50-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:13:50):**  truly no idea what they're actually buying and putting into their own supply chains.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:13:53):**  So the nutrition value could be so much lower or higher, probably not as what your model  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:13:59):**  would predict and say in this apple or in this piece of meat, there should be XYZ.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:14:04):**  And you see that there's absolutely nothing even near to that.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:14:09):**  It leads to a very interesting conversation with the supplier, I can imagine.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:14:12):**  Well, that's right.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:14:13):**  And so that's the other side.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:14:15):**  So now you're thinking, okay, well, hey, then now this is going to be a tool that retailers  
**[0:14:18-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:14:18):**  are going to use to beat up suppliers.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:14:21):**  But in reality, this is also a great tool for farmers and suppliers, because they didn't  
**[0:14:25-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:14:25):**  know either.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:14:26):**  And now if you have this tool in the field, you instead of saying, look, I'm going to,  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:14:31):**  I'm just going to hedge, I'm going to harvest all my apples, and then I'm going to come  
**[0:14:35-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:14:35):**  up with some blended price and throw away the ones that look terrible, or I know are  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:14:38):**  bad and kind of give you a blended price.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:14:40):**  But now if I can start to actually sort of dynamically assess each one of these and say,  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:14:44):**  well, you know what, these are actually tens out of tens, and hey, these are mid range  
**[0:14:49-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:14:49):**  quality and so on and so on.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:14:51):**  I might be able as a farmer to, you know, to get a better price, or I may actually be  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:14:55):**  able to use this technology, which we've seen in some pilots to harvest differently.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:15:00):**  So maybe I need to harvest these apples a little bit earlier, a little bit later, maybe  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:15:04):**  do something different, because the technology is so mobile, and you can do it while the  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:15:08):**  apples are still on the tree or the food is still on the ground.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:15:12):**  You can actually start to make different decisions before harvest.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:15:15):**  Which completely changes.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:15:16):**  I mean, it gets to that question you actually ask on the website.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:15:21):**  So how is food changing through the supply chain?  
**[0:15:24-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:15:24):**  And especially how's the quality of food changing through supply chain, especially as many products  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:15:28):**  are being harvested, maybe not ready or not at top quality.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:15:33):**  And then we sort of bring them through the whole chain to get to the local supermarket,  
**[0:15:37-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:15:37):**  to get to local shop.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:15:39):**  And they're basically changed as a product.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:15:41):**  And with this, you can follow and see, okay, where is the quality really going down?  
**[0:15:46-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:15:46):**  And how can I intervene with that?  
**[0:15:48-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:15:48):**  That's right.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:15:49):**  So we did a pilot with Tesco actually in Asia a while back where they were shipping grapes  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:15:55):**  from Chile to their operations in Thailand, retail stores in Thailand.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:15:59):**  And they were wasting, I think it was upwards of a million dollars a month in grapes, because  
**[0:16:05-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:16:05):**  of course, by the time they arrived from Chile, which is a huge shipment time, most of the  
**[0:16:11-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:16:11):**  shipments were spoiled.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:16:12):**  And so now with a technology like this, you can actually assess the quality before they  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:16:15):**  leave the shipping point and make a determination to say, you know what, these grapes will never  
**[0:16:20-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:16:20):**  make it all the way to Thailand.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:16:22):**  It's a whatever, 32 day trip and these grapes aren't going to survive 32 days.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:16:26):**  So you can pick the ones that might survive that or you can ship them differently to Thailand  
**[0:16:30-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:16:30):**  or you can ship them somewhere else.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:16:33):**  And so as a result of doing that, they greatly reduce waste and we're able to sort of dynamically  
**[0:16:38-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:16:38):**  route food from the port of origin.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:16:41):**  And what's the most surprising, there are probably many stories here, maybe I open up  
**[0:16:45-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:16:45):**  Pandora box, but what's the most surprising moment you've had in working with this quality  
**[0:16:51-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:16:51):**  focused, but still very mobile, let's say handheld devices plus obviously the models?  
**[0:16:58-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:16:58):**  I think the biggest surprise, well, there's two.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:17:01):**  One is I sort of touched on a second ago and that is that those in the supply chains, the  
**[0:17:07-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:17:07):**  so-called experts had no idea that this existed out there.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:17:10):**  I think everyone sort of understood, yes, of course over time an apple degrades, but  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:17:15):**  I don't think anyone realized that it degrades in a matter of weeks.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:17:19):**  So if you think about apple season is September and October for the most part, and at least  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:17:23):**  in parts of the world that we live in, after about six weeks that apple doesn't have any  
**[0:17:27-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:17:27):**  nutrition left in it.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:17:29):**  It's essentially sugar and water.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:17:31):**  So sorry, if even if it's stored in all the, they claim optimal circumstances and I'm eating,  
**[0:17:38-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:17:38):**  let's say it's September now, actually I'm eating it from basically the year before nutritionally  
**[0:17:43-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:17:43):**  it's pretty much that.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:17:44):**  Yep.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:17:45):**  It doesn't matter how you store it.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:17:46):**  So regardless of whether it's stored in MCP one, which is the suspended state that they  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:17:51):**  keep apples in or frozen, if you freeze it, hey, for the most, you know, not apples, of  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:17:55):**  course, but other foods, it may slow the degrades degradation down.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:17:59):**  But, but ultimately it happens.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:18:02):**  So if you're eating apples in January or February or certainly the spring and summer, hey, it's,  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:18:07):**  it's better than a Snickers bar, but essentially it's a, it's a sugar bomb.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:18:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:18:13):**  So that, that was a surprise.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:18:15):**  The second surprise though, is that price means nothing.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:18:20):**  So regardless of how much I'm paying for this as a consumer, essentially that price doesn't  
**[0:18:26-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:18:26):**  equate quality.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:18:27):**  So even if I'm going to a higher end retailer or buying in a farmer's markets or maybe buying  
**[0:18:32-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:18:32):**  organic versus conventional from a nutritional standpoint.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:18:35):**  So if we get the environmental footprint for a minute, there are really no differences.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:18:39):**  So if I go to a particular market, say London or Boston or we're at, and I look at apples  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:18:45):**  right now, right now is not a good time because it's kind of a blend of in season and out  
**[0:18:49-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:18:49):**  of season.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:18:50):**  Let's say in July I looked at apples.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:18:53):**  Apples essentially are bad everywhere in July or February in a market.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:18:57):**  Yeah, because if you find them at a farmer's market, it means they've been stored as well.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:19:00):**  That's right.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:19:01):**  But as a consumer, I'm thinking, well, but there's vast differences in the pricing of  
**[0:19:05-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:19:05):**  that.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:19:06):**  So I think that's where you start to realize, well, I'm buying a story, which, Hey, in some  
**[0:19:11-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:19:11):**  cases that's okay.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:19:12):**  Sometimes I like buying a story, but I want to know about that.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:19:15):**  I want to know that if I'm buying an apple and I'm paying 4.99 for that apple in July,  
**[0:19:21-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:19:21):**  I want to know that why I'm paying 4.99 for it.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:19:23):**  I like the retailer.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:19:24):**  I like the experience.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:19:25):**  Maybe it's extra sweet or whatever, but I don't want to believe that that 4.99 apple  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:19:30):**  has the same nutrition as it does in October when it's right off of a tree.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:19:34):**  And so really what we're trying to get to is not, Hey, stop eating apples.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:19:37):**  That's the last thing we want people to hear.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:19:39):**  It's more about, I just want people to make a more informed decision about that apple.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:19:43):**  So the whole discussion around local gets a whole new chapter, but especially the discussion  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:19:51):**  around seasonal and being as close to the farm or the producer as possible, because  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:19:57):**  if you're saying, let's stay with apples, it takes a few weeks.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:20:01):**  It obviously means the longer the less.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:20:04):**  I mean, is it a linear, like it depends probably how you store it, but is it a linear way down  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:20:09):**  and literally like if I eat it off the, let's say if I eat it off the tree or even eat it  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:20:14):**  a few weeks later, it is already a different apple.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:20:18):**  Well the answer is yes, but the, how do you get to that?  
**[0:20:22-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:20:22):**  Yes.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:20:23):**  Are always a little bit different.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:20:24):**  In some cases it's the effects of the supply chain.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:20:27):**  How was it shipped?  
**[0:20:28-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:20:28):**  You know, how was it stored?  
**[0:20:29-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:20:29):**  You know, temperature, humidity, things like that.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:20:31):**  In other cases it's how it was grown.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:20:33):**  So sticking with the apple example for a minute, in 2017 when we first started this living  
**[0:20:39-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:20:39):**  in New England, we went around to all the different New England orchards and we picked  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:20:42):**  apples right from a tree and we would have them back in our lab within the hour.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:20:47):**  So our team went out there and picked them, put them in the lab, tested them.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:20:50):**  And as you'd imagine, the nutrient contents were off the chart.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:20:54):**  Sometimes three, four, five X of what the label said should be in those apples for vitamin  
**[0:20:58-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:20:58):**  Cs and antioxidants and things like that.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:21:01):**  We went to the same orchards in 2018, exact same orchards, some cases the same row of  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:21:07):**  trees and picked the apples and took them to the lab within an hour and tested them.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:21:12):**  And we could find almost no hint of vitamin C in the apples.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:21:17):**  And so of course right away we thought, well, we have a technology problem, we have broken  
**[0:21:21-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:21:21):**  models or something happened in the lab or whatever.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:21:23):**  Machine is broken.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:21:24):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:21:25):**  And so, you know, of course we did it again and we tested things and all the scientists  
**[0:21:29-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:21:29):**  had a, you know, a week and a half of freak out and we realized, nope, everything works  
**[0:21:33-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:21:33):**  fine.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:21:34):**  They're just for whatever reason.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:21:36):**  And the farmer didn't know and we didn't know, but hey, the same apples or the apples from  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:21:41):**  the same orchards didn't have any vitamin C right off the tree.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:21:45):**  And so we looked into, you know, it was a little bit hotter, a little wetter season,  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:21:50):**  but the reality is there was just, there's no historical data to tell you why these apples  
**[0:21:54-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:21:54):**  were less nutritious despite being hours old.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:21:58):**  So it's really, I mean, we're getting to the farmer's level now and obviously with the  
**[0:22:02-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:22:02):**  tree it's sort of easier because you can go back to the same tree every year, but the  
**[0:22:08-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:22:08):**  management plus in this case, weather conditions probably fundamentally changed the product  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:22:14):**  in the sense that there's some years there's no vitamin C in your apple, even if you take  
**[0:22:20-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:22:20):**  it from the tree.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:22:21):**  That's right.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:22:22):**  Even if it's fresh off the tree, even if you went to a, you know, you pick orchard and  
**[0:22:25-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:22:25):**  with a family and picked an apple, there's no guarantee.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:22:27):**  So that was a long answer to, that was shocking for us to learn that.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:22:32):**  You just assumed, Hey, if I pick an apple off a tree, it doesn't get any fresher and  
**[0:22:36-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:22:36):**  any more nutritious than that.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:22:37):**  And where did you go from there?  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:22:39):**  Because it also sort of is, it's such a big thing when you discover that like basically  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:22:43):**  anything you see in the supermarket, you have no idea what's in it, even if you look at  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:22:47):**  the label and even if you pick it yourself, there's still zero guarantee that you get  
**[0:22:53-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:22:53):**  the nutritional values you want.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:22:55):**  Did it make you very pessimistic or what was the next step after that in terms of teak  
**[0:23:00-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:23:00):**  origin and your work?  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:23:01):**  Well, I think it, you know, it's, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a little discouraging,  
**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:23:06):**  but at the same time you're thinking, you can't fix the problem, right?  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:23:09):**  And this is the, to me, bigger topic we can get into someday about the food system.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:23:15):**  We pretend like we're fixing it, but it's hard to fix problems until you sort of face  
**[0:23:19-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:23:19):**  into reality.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:23:20):**  And so even though personally it was a little discouraging as a consumer, you're thinking,  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:23:24):**  okay, well at least now we're starting to get to some ground truth so we can start to  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:23:28):**  then rebuild and figure out, okay, well now we know this about apples and something else,  
**[0:23:33-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:23:33):**  spinach, for example, we learned it was seven days.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:23:35):**  After seven days, all the nutrients are essentially gone from spinach regardless of how it shipped  
**[0:23:39-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:23:39):**  or stored.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:23:40):**  Including frozen.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:23:41):**  Including frozen.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:23:42):**  Yep.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:23:43):**  So where we went is we said, okay, look, we're going to start with produce.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:23:47):**  So essentially the technology that we've created does three things.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:23:51):**  One is that determines quality, let's say nutritional quality or nutritional contents.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:23:56):**  The second thing it does is identifies adulteration.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:23:58):**  And then the third thing is authentication.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:24:01):**  So hey, is this truly Atlantic caught salmon or is it farmed salmon or is this Cabernet  
**[0:24:08-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:24:08):**  Sauvignon from this particular vineyard or not?  
**[0:24:11-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:24:11):**  Or is this wheat from a particular farm?  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:24:13):**  Or has this milk been adulterated or has this olive oil been adulterated?  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:24:17):**  I mean, all the ones you mentioned now, I think ones where there is an incredible amount  
**[0:24:21-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:24:21):**  of fraud and an incredible amount of changes happening.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:24:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:24:25):**  So they're probably good places to start.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:24:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:24:27):**  So we said, okay, well, let's start where we think we can have the largest impact.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:24:32):**  Each one of those, of course, has massive impact.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:24:33):**  But let's start where we kind of have some critical mass.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:24:36):**  And so we said, let's finish off this produce thing because apples are just kind of a place  
**[0:24:40-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:24:40):**  we started.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:24:41):**  And the time of year we actually started Teak Origin, it just sort of worked out where,  
**[0:24:46-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:24:46):**  you know, hey, apples, we were coming into apple season.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:24:48):**  So just in terms of impact, because I think it's interesting for investors to go through  
**[0:24:52-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:24:52):**  that process as well.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:24:53):**  So you see this basically, like the curtain is being pulled away, you suddenly see that  
**[0:24:58-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:24:58):**  everything you've been eating and working on, you don't know.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:25:02):**  And you've developed this technology to actually start knowing more of that.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:25:06):**  And you decided to not focus on olive oil, not focus on wine, which could have been very  
**[0:25:11-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:25:11):**  interesting from a different perspective.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:25:14):**  But you say that the most impact we can make is in produce.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:25:17):**  Can you explain a bit why you thought that and decided because you had to focus and you  
**[0:25:22-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:25:22):**  couldn't do all of it, obviously, not only because you started in apples, but I think  
**[0:25:25-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:25:25):**  there's there's more reason behind it.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:25:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:25:27):**  So what we've done now is we've created essentially models for the top 12 produce items, which  
**[0:25:33-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:25:33):**  represent about 60% of the fresh produce market.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:25:36):**  And the idea there is, hey, quality is something that's much easier to impact because of sort  
**[0:25:44-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:25:44):**  of two things.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:25:45):**  One is on the supply chain side of things, the example I gave about grapes at Tesco and,  
**[0:25:48-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:25:48):**  you know, getting things through the supply chain faster or more efficiently, we feel  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:25:52):**  like we could we could influence or affect change there quickly and start to have a positive  
**[0:25:57-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:25:57):**  impact.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:25:58):**  Secondly, on sort of the more anecdotal side of things, everyone we told the story to,  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:26:03):**  we've told it to thousands of years about sort of the peak origin concept.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:26:08):**  The thing that sort of resonated the most with people were simple things like the apple  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:26:12):**  story.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:26:13):**  I didn't realize that if I wanted to get the vitamin C equivalent of an apple, in some  
**[0:26:18-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:26:18):**  cases, I'd have to eat 25 apples to get that vitamin C. And so people could relate to that.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:26:23):**  It wasn't talking about farm caught salmon and Atlantic caught salmon.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:26:28):**  Hey, some people care about that.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:26:29):**  Some people don't know what you're talking about.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:26:31):**  Hey, some people don't care about whether my wine is real or not.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:26:34):**  But everyone related to the apple story, everyone related to leafy greens and spinach or produce  
**[0:26:40-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:26:40):**  and freshness.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:26:41):**  And so we thought that was just a good place to start from both a consumer standpoint to  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:26:45):**  get them sort of aware of this and starting to question and think about their food and  
**[0:26:50-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:26:50):**  for the supply chain to jump into action.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:26:52):**  And probably there's an enormous amount of waste in terms of freshness and not freshness  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:26:56):**  anymore like you mentioned with the grapes.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:26:58):**  I mean, wine can stay a bit longer and olive oil and maybe caught salmon if it's frozen.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:27:04):**  But everything else, especially in the produce aisle, a lot of that never gets sold for different  
**[0:27:11-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:27:11):**  reasons and thrown away.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:27:13):**  That's right.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:27:14):**  That's exactly right.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:27:15):**  And we kind of made a decision and it was a tough one because they were entrepreneurs.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:27:20):**  But we said if we could get the retailers on board with this, the downside of that is,  
**[0:27:26-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:27:26):**  hey, they're difficult to work with and they're not exactly forward thinkers and they don't  
**[0:27:30-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:27:30):**  move quickly and they don't adopt technology.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:27:32):**  But you need a client because you already excluded consumers as potential clients.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:27:37):**  And you need it.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:27:38):**  You need a client with access to the full supply chain and be able to measure quality  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:27:43):**  at the port in Chile of grapes, but also in Thailand and how they actually arrive.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:27:48):**  That's exactly right.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:27:49):**  You needed someone with scale that has the ability to sort of push back into the supply  
**[0:27:52-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:27:52):**  chain and affect change and someone who then can in turn reach the consumers, a large amount  
**[0:27:57-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:27:57):**  of consumers and say, OK, hey, we've now made we now made improvements.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:28:01):**  And so you can get better food to people or at least you can encourage better food decisions  
**[0:28:05-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:28:05):**  to more people faster.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:28:08):**  And so that's where we decided to start with this technology is sort of with the retailers,  
**[0:28:11-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:28:11):**  knowing that wasn't necessarily the easiest decision, but it wasn't going to make your  
**[0:28:15-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:28:15):**  life easier.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:28:16):**  But yeah, yeah.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:28:17):**  But but that's what we thought we could have the biggest impact.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:28:20):**  That's right.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:28:21):**  And I mean, it's absolutely fascinating.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:28:24):**  Have you seen I mean, we're you mentioned the spinach and the other produce you're working  
**[0:28:29-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:28:29):**  on in terms of management of soil, I think to get back to the podcast and regenerative  
**[0:28:35-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:28:35):**  agriculture.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:28:37):**  Have you seen anything there?  
**[0:28:38-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:28:38):**  And you mentioned organic versus nonorganic doesn't make any difference.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:28:41):**  If you look at the nutrition value, because in July, both of them are bad anyway, if you  
**[0:28:46-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:28:46):**  consider apples in our area of the world.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:28:49):**  What have you seen in terms of management?  
**[0:28:51-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:28:51):**  What have you seen in terms of the farms you may be visited?  
**[0:28:53-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:28:53):**  What have you seen there?  
**[0:28:55-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:28:55):**  And is there this holy connection that everybody talks about of healthy soils and healthy produce  
**[0:29:00-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:29:00):**  and does healthy gut?  
**[0:29:02-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:29:02):**  What have you seen there?  
**[0:29:03-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:29:03):**  Well, so I'll say first that we haven't done a lot of looking into specific changes or  
**[0:29:10-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:29:10):**  practices on a farm.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:29:11):**  In fact, I think you're going to be seeing him in a few weeks, David Montgomery.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:29:15):**  We actually have had a number of conversations with him where we're actually going to work  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:29:19):**  alongside David and his wife to do some studies on, you know, different types of practices.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:29:23):**  So hey, here's a farm that's practicing regenerative agriculture, and here's one that's not and  
**[0:29:28-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:29:28):**  what are the differences?  
**[0:29:29-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:29:29):**  So side by side comparisons.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:29:31):**  That would be amazing because he's they're bringing out a book.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:29:33):**  That's right.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:29:34):**  Minis wife, right?  
**[0:29:35-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:29:35):**  Yeah, specifically on this connection.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:29:36):**  I had him on the show two years ago, maybe on growing a revolution, like the current  
**[0:29:41-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:29:41):**  book on his journey in regend.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:29:43):**  Well, that's how we ended up talking.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:29:45):**  So he was speaking at an event that I was at recently.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:29:48):**  And he said, Hey, I'm having a difficult time writing my latest book because I can't get  
**[0:29:52-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:29:52):**  access.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:29:53):**  There's no data out there.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:29:54):**  And so I'm trying to prove, hey, that this regenerative agriculture is better, or it  
**[0:29:59-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:29:59):**  produces better food, but I can't find any data to support that.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:30:02):**  And so then we started talking anyway.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:30:04):**  But I will say this, that what we have been able to prove is I can tell the difference.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:30:09):**  So as I build this model up, and it seems like we're sticking with apples.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:30:13):**  So as I build the apple model up, you can choose any other crop, but that was our family.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:30:18):**  I mean, from all your conversations, it's such an easy, something that everybody probably  
**[0:30:22-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:30:22):**  eats every now and then.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:30:24):**  That's right.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:30:25):**  Exactly.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:30:26):**  Everyone knows the apple, right?  
**[0:30:27-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:30:27):**  Apple today, as I build the apple model, if I know the orchard that it came from, then  
**[0:30:33-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:30:33):**  we have a 96% accuracy in predicting the farm or the orchard where it came from.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:30:39):**  So if I know that farm A is using a very specific type of practice or doing something specific  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:30:45):**  with its soil and farm B is not, or they're doing something different now as a buyer,  
**[0:30:50-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:30:50):**  whether I'm a consumer or a supply chain customer, and I want to prove that, Hey, these apples  
**[0:30:56-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:30:56):**  or this wheat or whatever it is, is coming from farm A that's using these types of practices.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:31:00):**  I can at least validate that because the challenge today, I think from what I understand in the  
**[0:31:06-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:31:06):**  supply chain and the time I've spent in it is all the farms are, you know, a lot of farmers  
**[0:31:10-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:31:10):**  are trying to do the right thing and do better things and investing in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:31:14):**  But once it hits the supply chain, then things are just called food or they're just called  
**[0:31:18-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:31:18):**  apples or it's just called grain.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:31:20):**  And so it's really difficult to differentiate between the different growing practices.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:31:25):**  And so at least we're not the end all be all solution, but we're a solution that you're  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:31:29):**  able to say, okay, Hey, I know I can prove that this came from, from this farmer that  
**[0:31:34-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:31:34):**  are doing the right things.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:31:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:31:36):**  I can, I think you see it.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:31:37):**  A lot of farmers almost are pushed into selling directly because the market and the commodity  
**[0:31:43-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:31:43):**  market just doesn't value quality.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:31:46):**  And if they've done all the work, like you said, they invested, they spent a lot of time  
**[0:31:49-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:31:49):**  building their soil and the market just pays the commodity price.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:31:54):**  It sort of doesn't make sense.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:31:55):**  And you see a lot of them actually go trying to go directly.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:31:58):**  But of course, if you have a scale and probably that's been limiting, has been limiting the  
**[0:32:02-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:32:02):**  region egg movement that besides if you're too big, basically to go to the farmer's market  
**[0:32:06-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:32:06):**  every Saturday to sell your stuff, then you sort of are left out of this movement so far.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:32:12):**  And you see now some big retailers or some big food producers actually start to look  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:32:16):**  more and more into quality because of, of products like and technologies like yourself.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:32:21):**  And because there hasn't been any focus or any demand or any moment that basically retailers  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:32:27):**  or suppliers could actually ask for a certain kind of quality and then could actually test  
**[0:32:31-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:32:31):**  if you could actually do that, unless going to a lab, which is extremely expensive and  
**[0:32:35-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:32:35):**  probably too far from any farm to do so.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:32:38):**  I think that has been limiting the region egg movement for a long time, as you could  
**[0:32:41-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:32:41):**  do small scale and sell direct, which is great.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:32:43):**  But if you do 1000 acre or 1000 hectare farm, it gets into a whole different, you need to  
**[0:32:49-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:32:49):**  sell a lot of direct things to make that work.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:32:51):**  I think that's right on.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:32:52):**  I agree with you 100%.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:32:55):**  And so what are you working on like it's now September 2019?  
**[0:32:59-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:32:59):**  What are you working on now?  
**[0:33:00-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:33:00):**  What are you most excited about?  
**[0:33:02-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:33:02):**  If you can share that obviously, in terms of tick origin?  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:33:05):**  Yeah, so for the last two years, we've been really focused on just making the science  
**[0:33:10-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:33:10):**  work.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:33:11):**  It was important for us to have the scientific community behind us.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:33:14):**  It was important for us to get this right and sort of being not stealth mode, I hate  
**[0:33:19-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:33:19):**  that term, but just very quiet about what we were doing.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:33:21):**  We conducted a number of pilots in the supply chain, but we just wanted to get it right.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:33:26):**  And so now we feel comfortable.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:33:27):**  And you know, our scientists will say, you'll never get it 100%.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:33:30):**  But we're at a point now we're ready to share it with the world.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:33:33):**  So in January of 2020, we're launching what we call the food quality index.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:33:37):**  And essentially, it's these top 12 produce items that we are now out, basically scanning  
**[0:33:44-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:33:44):**  them in multiple markets.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:33:46):**  And when I say scanning, we're just buying them as consumers would buy these foods.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:33:50):**  So you think about grapes and avocados and apples and blueberries and strawberries and  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:33:54):**  spinach and bananas, all the common stuff that regardless of where you live, are the  
**[0:33:59-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:33:59):**  staples, if you will.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:34:01):**  And we're buying those as consumers and at multiple retailers at all different price  
**[0:34:04-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:34:04):**  points.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:34:06):**  And we're just creating this massive data set.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:34:08):**  And in January, we'll share this with consumers in a couple different markets.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:34:13):**  So they can start to interact with this data just to say, wow, you know, did you know this?  
**[0:34:18-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:34:18):**  And it's not meant to say, hey, don't shop at retailer A or did you know retailer B?  
**[0:34:23-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:34:23):**  It's not that at all.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:34:24):**  It's sort of putting the user at the center of this and just saying, hey, this is something  
**[0:34:27-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:34:27):**  that may or may not be aware of, or you may not even care about, but did you know?  
**[0:34:33-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:34:33):**  Simultaneously to that, we are working on some major retail pilots that are building  
**[0:34:39-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:34:39):**  the business case up to say, well, this is not just about dropping a grenade into the  
**[0:34:43-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:34:43):**  marketplace and saying, hey, good luck with that retailer.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:34:46):**  Go everyone for themselves.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:34:47):**  We're saying, okay, now we want to share this information with consumers because we think  
**[0:34:52-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:34:52):**  as consumers, we deserve it.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:34:54):**  But in addition to that, we're building this use case or this business case with these  
**[0:34:57-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:34:57):**  retailers to say, but we're also fixing the problem.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:35:00):**  So it's possible for retailers and producers to bring you solutions to these problems that  
**[0:35:05-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:35:05):**  you may or may not know you've ever had.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:35:08):**  So that is coming in January.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:35:10):**  So now we're just collecting data.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:35:11):**  We're actually building the technology platform and working on these pilots with some of our  
**[0:35:16-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:35:16):**  retail partners.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:35:17):**  That's a very, very busy time.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:35:19):**  Like an image.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:35:20):**  It is.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:35:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:35:22):**  It's exciting because we're getting out of that R and D mode and spending a lot of time  
**[0:35:24-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:35:24):**  in the lab.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:35:25):**  And now we're interacting with the world, which is both exciting and scary.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:35:30):**  And what do you see in terms of when you look at quality in the supply chain and food system?  
**[0:35:35-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:35:35):**  What are the biggest barriers so far?  
**[0:35:38-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:35:38):**  And you mentioned it's impossible to measure.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:35:41):**  Do you think the consumer would be willing to pay for quality as well?  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:35:46):**  I mean, we sort of are doing that because we think organic or we think XYZ is better.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:35:51):**  But what do you see as the biggest barriers beyond the technology platform, beyond knowing  
**[0:35:54-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:35:54):**  what is quality?  
**[0:35:55-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:35:55):**  Because we seem to have, or at least are on the way of fixing that.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:35:59):**  What are other big barriers that you're working on or worried about or other things we as  
**[0:36:04-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:36:04):**  a sector have to fix?  
**[0:36:06-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:36:06):**  It's always that unknown, right?  
**[0:36:07-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:36:07):**  I mean, you know, you worked on something for so long and you're thinking, OK, well,  
**[0:36:11-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:36:11):**  this has to be relevant and useful.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:36:14):**  But the reality is we may share with consumers and people say, hey, who cares?  
**[0:36:18-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:36:18):**  I don't think that's the case because we've done some homework, but there's always that  
**[0:36:22-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:36:22):**  risk of that.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:36:23):**  I think one of the biggest hurdles in the supply chain is time.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:36:27):**  So if you look at some of the retailers today, and I guess I'll use names, so like Aldi,  
**[0:36:33-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:36:33):**  for example, or Walmart or some of the retailers that are high volume and Walmart turns things  
**[0:36:40-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:36:40):**  over very quickly and Aldi, they source their produce very opportunistically.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:36:44):**  Hey, this week I need X number of pallets or truckloads or whatever food.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:36:48):**  I'm going to buy it, put it on my shelf.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:36:50):**  When it's gone, it's gone.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:36:51):**  I'm going to next week I'll buy something different.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:36:54):**  I don't know their policies, so maybe they have much more stringent policies than their  
**[0:36:58-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:36:58):**  peers.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:36:59):**  My gut tells me they don't.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:37:00):**  My gut tells me that their quality tends to be better than their peers.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:37:04):**  And I think it's because they're moving things through very quickly.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:37:07):**  Whereas on the high end of things, if you take a Whole Foods in the US or like a Waitrose  
**[0:37:12-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:37:12):**  in the UK, their quality tends to be not as good.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:37:17):**  And I think it's not because they have lower standards or they're doing anything different  
**[0:37:21-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:37:21):**  other than they're just not moving food through the supply chain as quickly.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:37:24):**  So I don't know how to solve that problem in Whole Foods or a Waitrose, but I do know  
**[0:37:29-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:37:29):**  that we have an update analysis.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:37:31):**  If you can get things moving through quicker than common sense says because quality only  
**[0:37:37-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:37:37):**  lasts so long, you're going to have higher quality in the store or at the consumer end  
**[0:37:42-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:37:42):**  of things.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:37:43):**  That's extremely interesting.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:37:44):**  I mean, it triggers two thoughts.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:37:45):**  One, let's hope we're not starting flying everything to get it as fast as possible from  
**[0:37:50-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:37:50):**  Chile to Thailand and in the case of grapes or anything else.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:37:53):**  And two, probably there will be some, let's say, movements around how to store things  
**[0:37:59-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:37:59):**  differently.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:38:00):**  Well, until now, it seems like that had no impact whatsoever.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:38:03):**  But with technology like this, probably you can start actually measuring, does this peel  
**[0:38:08-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:38:08):**  have a certain effect?  
**[0:38:10-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:38:10):**  Does this gas, et cetera, et cetera?  
**[0:38:12-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:38:12):**  And maybe it starts looking at the management of the farms or the producers.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:38:17):**  But it's interesting that time is such an important factor.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:38:20):**  We often, I don't think, consider it enough to, especially around produce.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:38:25):**  Well, and you said a key thing.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:38:27):**  We definitely don't want to be flying precious food all over the world.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:38:31):**  So the three things that we're measuring and we'll be reporting to consumers, of course,  
**[0:38:35-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:38:35):**  to retailers as well.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:38:36):**  One is the actual quality that we've been talking about.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:38:39):**  The second one is price.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:38:40):**  And then the third thing are miles.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:38:43):**  So how far did this food have to come to get here?  
**[0:38:46-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:38:46):**  And so if you start to look at that from a consumer perspective, you think, okay, well-  
**[0:38:50-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:38:50):**  But also the way of transport in that or just the distance?  
**[0:38:53-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:38:53):**  If we know it, but we don't always know, because right now-  
**[0:38:55-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:38:55):**  You cannot see it probably.  
**[0:38:56-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:38:56):**  Yeah, we can't.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:38:57):**  Does the pressure of a plane have a different effect?  
**[0:39:00-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:39:00):**  That could be interesting.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:39:01):**  That's right.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:39:02):**  But at first, it's just information that the consumer can start to contextualize.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:39:06):**  So if I think, okay, look, I'm shopping at a high-end retailer, and I see the quality  
**[0:39:11-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:39:11):**  score is 60 out of 100.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:39:14):**  So maybe, okay, but it's not fantastic.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:39:17):**  And then I can see, well, hey, but the price is high.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:39:19):**  And hey, in order to get that 60, I've had to, maybe it's local, maybe that became 25  
**[0:39:25-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:39:25):**  miles away.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:39:26):**  So okay, that starts to align with my values, and I get that.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:39:30):**  Or you say, hey, well, maybe there's a 77 out of 100 in terms of quality.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:39:34):**  Hey, the price is much lower, but it had to come 7,000 miles to me.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:39:38):**  So again, this is all a test.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:39:41):**  But as a consumer, you can start to at least understand a little bit more about your food,  
**[0:39:45-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:39:45):**  because today it's a given.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:39:46):**  If I grab an apple, I assume that whatever the label says, regardless of where it's from,  
**[0:39:50-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:39:50):**  it is what it is.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:39:51):**  And we just want to start to change that dynamic and change that thinking to get your mind  
**[0:39:56-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:39:56):**  around this a little bit more.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:39:57):**  And until that happens, it's really hard to drive or to introduce change.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:40:01):**  And you might even get like the apples of this year, like we mentioned before, have  
**[0:40:06-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:40:06):**  an extremely high vitamin C. You almost get a bit of wine talk around this year has been  
**[0:40:12-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:40:12):**  a really good year for apples, not just in terms of quantity, but actually in terms of  
**[0:40:16-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:40:16):**  quality.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:40:17):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:40:18):**  And you think about what this could do for local, because local has always sort of been  
**[0:40:20-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:40:20):**  this fringe thing.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:40:21):**  And for lots of, there's other challenges, but in the case of spinach, which I mentioned  
**[0:40:25-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:40:25):**  earlier, so the reality with spinach and when I say spinach is really leafy greens.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:40:31):**  If you want to eat those for their nutrient contents, then you're going to have to grow  
**[0:40:35-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:40:35):**  it closer to where they're consumed, period.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:40:38):**  You're not going to be able to get leafy greens and spinach from the fields in Southern Mexico  
**[0:40:42-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:40:42):**  to Europe or to the East Coast of the United States in time for them to have any material  
**[0:40:47-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:40:47):**  nutrient contents.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:40:48):**  So now all of a sudden you start to build business cases around having to grow these  
**[0:40:52-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:40:52):**  type of foods closer to where they're consumed or getting your mind around seasonality to  
**[0:40:58-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:40:58):**  what you mentioned earlier.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:41:00):**  You think about what is it now three generations maybe that have no idea about seasonality  
**[0:41:05-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:41:05):**  of food, right?  
**[0:41:06-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:41:06):**  I mean, I think we're, I know I'm old enough anyway to remember, Hey, there was a cherry  
**[0:41:10-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:41:10):**  season and a watermelon season.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:41:12):**  And nowadays that's a concept on my teenage kids.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:41:15):**  They have no idea what I'm talking about.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:41:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:41:18):**  And I think it gets to price as well.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:41:19):**  Everybody's always talking about it.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:41:21):**  It's too expensive to buy good quality.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:41:23):**  I mean, we don't even know what good quality is, but let's say we, in a year from now,  
**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:41:27):**  we know and it's, it's open and everybody can tell, but then suddenly if you have to  
**[0:41:32-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:41:32):**  eat 25 apples to get to the same level of the other Apple that you could also buy, suddenly  
**[0:41:38-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:41:38):**  the whole price difference of a few percent of even 10 or 20% doesn't really matter if  
**[0:41:42-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:41:42):**  you're going for nutrients.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:41:43):**  But I think healthcare will be a very important point there, but we need to know before, before  
**[0:41:48-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:41:48):**  unlocking that.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:41:49):**  And then suddenly the price discussion becomes a completely different, becomes nutrients  
**[0:41:52-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:41:52):**  per Euro per dollar or nutrients per pound.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:41:56):**  And it's very interesting, very scary for anybody in the food system, but also very  
**[0:42:01-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:42:01):**  interesting from especially people semi out like we are.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:42:04):**  Well, it's funny because we've been doing these interviews and I think about three dozen  
**[0:42:09-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:42:09):**  interviews now with retail executives from around the world as we're developing this  
**[0:42:13-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:42:13):**  user experience for our platform.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:42:16):**  And you know, these represent producers and retailers from all around the world.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:42:21):**  And when you talk to them, we call it the split screen effect.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:42:25):**  So when you're telling about this, we're having a conversation similar to the one we're having  
**[0:42:28-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:42:28):**  now when they put their individual or their consumer hat on, they're very interested in  
**[0:42:33-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:42:33):**  this.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:42:34):**  Wow, I want this, or I wish I had this or my wife or my family, this would be very useful.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:42:38):**  I could see how I would use this at home.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:42:41):**  And then something you said just triggered this thought, but then they sort of say, well,  
**[0:42:43-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:42:43):**  wait a minute.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:42:44):**  They put their day job hat back on and they say, well, you can't communicate price.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:42:49):**  That's not right.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:42:50):**  And hey, you can't, you know, this is dangerous to be able to communicate this to public,  
**[0:42:54-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:42:54):**  just sharing quality information.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:42:56):**  And it's like, it's funny to see this sort of Jekyll and Hyde thing happening in their  
**[0:43:01-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:43:01):**  minds.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:43:02):**  You know, they just, it's this traditional mindset of being in the supply chain.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:43:05):**  And then there's this like, oh, wait a minute, but I'm also a consumer too.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:43:08):**  So it's happened, I think in 100% of the conversations we've had so far.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:43:13):**  And it's that difficult because some of these are your clients and do you get tension there  
**[0:43:17-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:43:17):**  as well?  
**[0:43:18-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:43:18):**  Like transparency is great, but only to a certain extent.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:43:21):**  For sure.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:43:22):**  And so part of the reason why we've decided to kind of take this dual approach, Hey, let's  
**[0:43:25-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:43:25):**  share this in a very measured, in a very constrained way with consumers is that these same retailers  
**[0:43:32-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:43:32):**  and these clients have admitted they sort of need that nudge.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:43:35):**  It's not going to be enough for one of their peers to adopt this technology.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:43:38):**  And then, you know, sort of all the dominoes fall.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:43:41):**  They're going to need the tension, you know, retailers tend to make changes when their  
**[0:43:44-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:43:44):**  customers demand change.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:43:46):**  And so I think as much as they sort of resisted and don't necessarily like it, they also get  
**[0:43:51-0:43:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:43:51):**  it until their customers sort of say, well, wait a minute, I looked at this week's results  
**[0:43:55-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:43:55):**  from the food quality index and I see that, Hey, you're not doing so great.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:43:59):**  And that's going to drive change.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:44:02):**  And at the same time, the retailer is going to come from the other direction to say, well,  
**[0:44:06-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:44:06):**  Hey, guess what?  
**[0:44:07-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:44:07):**  We've been working on our avocado problem or we've been working on our blueberry problem.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:44:11):**  So it's never going to perfectly meet in the middle, but we have to take this sort of dual  
**[0:44:15-0:44:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:44:15):**  approach.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:44:16):**  Yeah, I think it makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:44:18):**  I want to be conscious of your time.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:44:19):**  I think there's so much more to cover, but I want to end with a few questions I usually  
**[0:44:24-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:44:24):**  ask.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:44:25):**  And one of that is inspired by it by John Kemp, who I interviewed before, was doing  
**[0:44:29-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:44:29):**  a lot of work on actually fruit quite a bit.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:44:32):**  And what do you believe to be true about modern agriculture could also be region agriculture,  
**[0:44:37-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:44:37):**  would you prefer that others don't believe to be true?  
**[0:44:40-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:44:40):**  I think the scientific worldview is no substitute for human life.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:44:44):**  I don't want food, regenerative agriculture or the modernization of the food system to  
**[0:44:49-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:44:49):**  make the same mistakes that we've made with climate change and other things.  
**[0:44:53-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:44:53):**  If we can't find a way for the masses to understand what this means to me, what does this change?  
**[0:45:01-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:45:01):**  And if you go to a regenerative agriculture conference, you know, Hey, there's 150 different  
**[0:45:05-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:45:05):**  definitions of what it is, and this grass fed, and it's organic and permaculture and  
**[0:45:10-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:45:10):**  whatever.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:45:11):**  And you get that across all sort of the food system these days, everyone's driving change.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:45:15):**  But if we can't easily translate to what it means to an individual consumer or the everyday  
**[0:45:21-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:45:21):**  person, then I think this is going to remain on the fringe.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:45:24):**  And I think we're going to be struggling with this for decades to come, which I think we  
**[0:45:28-0:45:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:45:28):**  both agree we can't afford for that to happen.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:45:31):**  So I think, you know, what we're trying to do is just one small, tiny little piece of  
**[0:45:36-0:45:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:45:36):**  it.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:45:37):**  But I think what we all have to try to do together, much more collectively, is find  
**[0:45:40-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:45:40):**  a way to relate all the work that we're doing to the individual so that they can make better  
**[0:45:45-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:45:45):**  choices in their lives.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:45:48):**  That's why I'm interested in the nutrient density of food and the connection to healthy soil  
**[0:45:52-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:45:52):**  is that it touches you and your children directly, like what you eat, and how it's being grown.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:45:58):**  And we're going to wait for a lot of results with David Montgomery.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:46:02):**  But there is some we see already in some mostly anecdotal evidence, but that connection, if  
**[0:46:08-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:46:08):**  that's such a strong connection, it would be even if you don't care about climate change,  
**[0:46:13-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:46:13):**  even care about drought, if you don't care about agriculture in general, you care about  
**[0:46:17-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:46:17):**  health, or at least you sort of care about you and your children, most people, and that  
**[0:46:22-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:46:22):**  could trigger unlock a lot of demand for people that are growing nutrient dense food in a  
**[0:46:28-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:46:28):**  different way.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:46:29):**  I think that's spot on.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:46:30):**  I think that's right.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:46:31):**  And it might answer actually the question I'm asking now, but if you could change one  
**[0:46:35-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:46:35):**  thing overnight, if you could wave a magic wand and tomorrow morning, we wake up and  
**[0:46:39-0:46:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:46:39):**  Greg has changed something, what would it be in the food system?  
**[0:46:42-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:46:42):**  Could also be in general, but let's stick to it.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:46:44):**  Oh, I was gonna say, yeah, I think, if I can wave a magic wand, it would be for all of  
**[0:46:53-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:46:53):**  us to have the tools and the desire to understand what we're putting in our bodies, how it affects  
**[0:46:59-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:46:59):**  our health and how those decisions reverberate across our communities and our planet.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:47:06):**  And I say tools because they don't exist, but also the desire, which doesn't always  
**[0:47:10-0:47:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:47:10):**  exist.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:47:11):**  So I think those are two, as we were sort of joking beforehand, two giant mountains  
**[0:47:16-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:47:16):**  that we still have to climb.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:47:17):**  And I see those as two different mountains, creating that desire and building the tools.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:47:22):**  Yeah, we were joking before for the interview, we're in the food system and the more you  
**[0:47:27-0:47:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:47:27):**  know, the more difficult it is and the more you see actually it has to change.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:47:30):**  And it seems like we're climbing a mountain and the mountain keeps growing.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:47:33):**  We don't even see the size and the stone we're pushing up keeps getting bigger as well.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:47:37):**  It starts to snow, et cetera.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:47:38):**  But it's a fun, interesting and very, very rewarding at least for me.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:47:42):**  Cannot speak for me right so far.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:47:45):**  But yeah, there probably will be two mountains here, the ones you're describing now.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:47:49):**  Yes, I agree.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:47:51):**  It's maddening and it's rewarding at the same time.  
**[0:47:53-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:47:53):**  And I can't imagine doing anything different with my life, however long that might be.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:47:58):**  I cannot imagine a better way to finish the interview.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:48:02):**  I think it was extremely interesting.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:48:03):**  I wish you a lot of luck launching this in January.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:48:06):**  I think it's going to create the shockwave, maybe not through a hand grenade, maybe through  
**[0:48:10-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:48:10):**  a stone in a pond.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:48:11):**  But it's going to probably pull the curtain on a lot of things we thought we knew about  
**[0:48:16-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:48:16):**  food and we actually don't.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:48:17):**  So thank you for your time, for your hard work, and I'll definitely be checking in probably

**[0:51:52-0:51:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:51:52):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:51:53-0:51:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:51:53):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:51:55-0:51:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:51:55):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:51:58-0:52:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:51:58):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:52:01):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/15/greg-shewmaker/#t=0:52:03):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.

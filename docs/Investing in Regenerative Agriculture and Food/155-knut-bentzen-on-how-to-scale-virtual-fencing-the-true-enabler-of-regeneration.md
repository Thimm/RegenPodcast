### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2022-00-04)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com slash course or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  The potential of managed grazing of ruminants is enormous on food quality, protein production,  soil carbon, water quality, animal welfare and a lot more.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:00:23):**  So could virtual fencing be the enabler to scale this seriously during the next decade  of regeneration?  And what is needed for that?  This is a conversation with a CEO that has experience in scaling up technology companies  and who is coming into the regeneration space.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:00:37):**  We talk about farmers and their stories, profit, methane research and transitions.  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  the planet mattered.  A podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:01:00):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers, start paying much more  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:01:18):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  our work.  And so many of you have joined as a member.  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:01:34):**  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.

Welcome to another episode of the podcast today, the second in a series of interviews,  
**[0:01:53-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:01:53):**  unpacking the potential of virtual fencing with the team of no fence.  And today we have the CEO Knut Benson.  Welcome Knut.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks a lot, Koen.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:01):**  And you had a quite a considerable working life before joining a virtual fencing company.  So what brought you to that and how did you end up in soil?  It's a good question really.  And a quite considerable working life.  Yeah, I'm 59.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:13):**  So I didn't want to say you're old.  That wasn't my implication, but you have a lot, let's say better.  You have a lot of experience.  I do.  I do.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:22):**  And why did I do it?  I think there's several reasons.  It's I have to say just emotionally, I totally fell for the concept when I heard what it  was about.  It happened quite traditionally.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:32):**  So I got this call from a headhunter and I'd even misheard the name.  So I thought they said it was a company with IOT and virtual.  They said, I thought I said no sense.  That didn't make any sense to me at all.  I didn't understand what it was.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:46):**  No offense.  I looked it up.  I totally fell for it.  Why did I do so?  I guess being at my age and being of my generation, I kind of feel that it's time to give back  
**[0:02:57-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:57):**  a bit to society.  I feel that consciously or unconsciously, we've been utilizing nature in a way which  hasn't been sustainable.  And being a Norwegian, being brought up and being so fortunate to be in a cabin in the  summers, which was way up in the mountains in Norway, going up to local farmer, helping  
**[0:03:14-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:03:14):**  herd in the cows, making the cows and all these things.  I always had a close connection to agriculture and to farming and to livestock.  So when this opportunity comes up, it's a Norwegian patent.  I felt I could use all my experience from the last 14 years and other companies I've  been in.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:03:33):**  Well, there was just no question.  I just had to jump at it.  So yeah, here I am.  And how has been the journey?  Because it's been since, let's say, summer last year, 2021.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:03:42):**  That's like four or five months.  How has been this crash course of grazing and fencing?  And what's the biggest surprise?  I wonder if the biggest surprise in one way was that something I learned as a kid in school  about the photosynthesis is so important and that it sort of had been totally off my mind  
**[0:04:04-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:04:04):**  for so many years.  And I do believe I'm quite a conscious person with regard to nature.  I'm involved.  I've been on a board in a foundation that supports prevention of plastic pollution of  the ocean.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:04:16):**  I'm a freediver.  I've been close to nature all my life.  But seeing and understanding the impacts of that, and also having seen David Attenborough  tell me about how the atmosphere actually was made out of the photosynthesis from the  algae in the ocean in the beginning, and how the early ruminants like dinosaurs were sort  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:04:37):**  of keeping that whole cycle alive and now seeing how it's done and can be done regenerative  and managed racing and silver pasture and so forth.  It really blew my mind.  Yeah, I thought, what a fantastic gift to be able to be part of such a journey and contribute.  For sure, you had to explain it to people that are completely new to, let's say, grazing  
**[0:04:57-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:04:57):**  as well.  So if you would say, if somebody will knock on the door and says, I'm very interested  in nature and photosynthesis, but what does it have to do with grazing?  What would be your few sentences to get that hook and then explain?  I mean, the complexity is impossible in a few sentences, but to explain enough for that  
**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:05:13):**  person to get super excited or interested to dig further, because that's what I see  often on the podcast as well.  The importance of that simple between brackets concept is mind boggling, but at the same  time, you don't want to overload somebody with too much information.  So how would you, if you meet somebody in the hallway of a conference, which hopefully  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:05:30):**  will happen soon in person, what would be your conversation there if somebody said,  I'm interested in the photosynthesis, what does it have to do with grazing?  Yeah, I think the number one thing you need to find out, if people actually know what  the photosynthesis does, right?  But the sheer fact that it takes carbon dioxide out of the air and sequestrates carbon and  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:05:48):**  releases oxygen, that whole process, that it's accelerated by grazing.  And I think the best explanation I've heard so far is from a fellow here in Norway who  also has a podcast.  And he made the comparison between the way ruminants were grazing back before humans  domesticated them and that they were hunted by predators.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:06:09):**  They were herding together in tight little herds, grazing and competing for the food.  And then they would leave their dumps and then would move on and let the grass rest.  And that circle of getting stressed and then have rest, just like a muscle.  If you want to train a muscle, you stress it hard and then you let it rest.  The problem comes if you overtrain it or you don't train it, that's the same thing with  
**[0:06:32-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:06:32):**  the soil.  And simply the fact that the bacteria that is in the stomachs of the ruminants actually  is needed for that circle to go proper on in the soil.  It just makes total sense.  Which is very interesting because people would say just that fact that the animal is needed  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:06:51):**  is already a very interesting point that many people overlook.  Like it's not enough to put a big fence around a nature area that we want to preserve and  then hope that it regenerates, which it might do in a certain way.  But with animals, with ruminants mostly included in that, which could be wild, which could  be not, but managed in a certain way, because there it comes back, like it's the management  
**[0:07:12-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:07:12):**  of, it can be sped up considerably or even without that it won't take off entirely.  Like it's the need of livestock and animals, grazing animals in regeneration.  Is something that many people didn't get their heads around yet.  The second question is, should we eat them or not?  I think that's a whole different discussion on the vegan side of things, but the use between  
**[0:07:33-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:07:33):**  brackets because I'm not saying it in a bad way of animals as a tool in regeneration is  something that we still, I still find many people that completely overlook that.  Like grass with animals or grass without animals is a very different thing or a forest with  or a landscape with or without.  There's a very different potential in terms of photosynthesis and in terms of does the  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:07:52):**  amount of solar energy we can take and the amount of life biomass, et cetera.  Do you see that as well?  Very often that that surprise like, ah, we actually potentially need animals in this  process of regeneration?  So far I haven't.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:08:05):**  I don't know.  Maybe it's because I live in Norway as well, but I think there's a lot of people who are  quite close to nature as such there.  So to see that link quite closely, maybe it's because I speak to people that are in that  situation.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:08:19):**  It's very different if I went to some of the gaming halls or whatever and I spoke to young  people that aren't that close necessarily.  I don't know.  But I think in general, people have a pretty good understanding that nature hasn't really  invented a whole lot that is unproductive or goes the wrong way, right?  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:08:38):**  There's a circle of life that makes a lot of sense to most people.  Maybe by actually also pointing out some of the opposites, you get a lot of understanding.  So well, over millions of years, nature has developed things like the ruminants, like  the cow, for instance, and like the goat.  And they typically grass in different areas and the giraffe grasses in different areas  
**[0:09:01-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:09:01):**  as well.  And they're sort of specialized for those specific types of food that they have.  And that whole ecosystem around them simply works.  So if you take the opposite, why does it make sense to put a machine between the pasture  and the ruminant?  
**[0:09:16-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:09:16):**  That just makes sense.  So putting the machine between the grass and the cow, when the cow is the most efficient  grazing machine there is.  Yeah, that also helps people intuitively see it, I think.  But then getting more research into this is clearly a way to help educate everyone, I  
**[0:09:34-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:09:34):**  think, including ourselves, right?  We're kind of rediscovering something which has been there for a long time.  Now, do we need to understand more of it?  That's the beauty of science, isn't it?  And then the next step is sort of like, you're still talking to that person in the hallway  
**[0:09:48-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:09:48):**  of a conference to the technology to virtual fencing.  How do you describe that in a few sentences to someone that never heard about it before?  And basically never heard about it before?  Like, what does that mean?  Just like you heard it wrong, maybe the first time like, oh, it's devices, and it makes  
**[0:10:04-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:10:04):**  no sense.  Like, what would you say that?  Well, I try to explain simply what it is.  And most people heard about it.  If you told people in urban areas, you know, they know about geofencing of pushbikes, right?  
**[0:10:16-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:10:16):**  So that's basically the same principle, right?  You use the GPS, but simply helping them understand that the way you normally would fence.  And what's in is either a physical fence or an electrical fence.  And this basically takes that whole concept and attaches it to the animal itself.  Instead of just letting the animal feel the border of the fence when it hits the barbed  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:10:36):**  wire or hits the electrical fence, you actually have a sound system that gives the animal  predictability.  So before it enters that border, it will hear this beep beep beep beep sound that sort of  tells it that here's the border.  And they learn it so quick.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:10:53):**  To me telling the stories about animals that do this and also this is funny story, you  know, see yourself is always the beauty, right?  And there's this goat that one of our founders has.  And it's she's such a clever little girl that goat, she knows where the fence goes, and  she passes past it just to grab what she wants.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:11:12):**  And then she turns about and goes back before she gets an impulse.  So that's how smart these animals are.  And you see how it works on another one.  One of the cows is called the fence trimmer because she consistently goes around the fence,  you can always trace that particular animal and see where the fence is actually going.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:11:31):**  So telling these stories about how the animals behave when they're using the technology,  that's a good thing.  And then, of course, the app and putting all this in the hands of the farmer.  So you come with this scale up experience in a very different industry, the virtual  conferencing industry.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:11:46):**  I mean, there's the word virtual, but that's all that is.  And you bring that to agriculture, to land use and to technology, like there is definitely  an exponential piece in that definitely a scalable piece.  But there's also a very old industry, a very large industry.  What do you see, let's say, what's the biggest barrier?  
**[0:12:02-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:12:02):**  What do you see now?  You've been a few months in the company and looking around the sector as for this to really  to really take off.  And like in 10 years, most fencing, or most, let's say most animals are managed in this  way.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:12:14):**  Most fencing has disappeared.  What is stopping from doing that?  I think there's many things.  I think it's hard to sort of pick like one particular thing.  It's interesting that you mentioned my own industry because video conferencing, I think,  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:12:29):**  really became the big hit when people had to, right?  The pandemic hit and the pandemic did more for video conferencing than 20 years of marketing  and sales.  So what do we need for virtual fencing that people have to, is it like a ban on fencing  or that suddenly, like what would be that, or is it climate?  
**[0:12:49-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:12:49):**  And like, what would be that push that we might need or farmers might need?  I'm almost thinking back three, four, five years when I started free diving and I got  into an environment where people were very concerned about plastic pollution in the ocean.  And then there was a whale that stranded on the coast of Norway that had so many plastic  bags inside it, it died because of that.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:13:12):**  It really opened the eyes of the public.  And then I think almost within a year when people really sort of saw the connection,  people were smart.  People aren't stupid, they're smart.  So when they see the real connection, then they will act accordingly.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:13:26):**  And this is what happened, I think, when it comes to plastic pollution, you see how society  has turned around and made plastic pollution in the ocean like one of the real big things  on the agenda.  I believe that when you start to see what UN says about the rate at which we're losing  our topsoil, I think maybe what people need to do is to sort of see the practical aspects  
**[0:13:47-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:13:47):**  of it.  If you take the whole picture, it almost becomes overwhelming for us all, doesn't it?  Too much.  Yeah.  Because the topsoil is always interesting, but only for the geeks of us that are deep  
**[0:13:59-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:13:59):**  in it.  Like a whale on a beach is filled with plastic or filled with plastic is a very, I mean,  everybody sees that.  Like there's no way to look around.  And I don't know, I'm not wishing for something like that in regeneration, but do you feel  
**[0:14:14-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:14):**  like what is the moment there?  Maybe there are different moments in different places.  Like maybe it's a very local thing, like a certain bushfire that never happened or a  certain heat wave or a certain flood or a certain something that triggers looking differently  at soil.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:27):**  I don't know.  I don't know if it's going to be on a country level.  I'm thinking what could trigger action around this and action of almost everybody or enough  of a minority that it actually triggers something.  We'll look back at that and say, ah, those were the points.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:39):**  I don't know.  We won't pick them now probably, but it's like topsoil loses so slow and it's so fast,  but it's so slow.  And if you look at it, that it's simply, yeah, it's been going on for 60, 70, sometimes hundreds,  sometimes thousands of years.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:53):**  And yeah, we worried about it, but it's not, it doesn't get on top of the agenda.  True.  But the political landscape is incredibly important here as well, I believe.  And I think that when you start to see signs coming with more and more proof, that will  also change one of the most important things I think in this whole landscape.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:15:12):**  And that is the way we are running subsidies across agriculture in all nations and continents,  because it is a heavily subsidized industry.  And that is the simplest way to do it.  Again, like you said, I've been working for a global company now for almost 15 years and  traveled a lot to the US, to Asia, Europe.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:15:33):**  And what I've seen is there's such a change when people are doing something about subsidies.  In the region, electric cars have sort of been the big thing because electrical power  was so cheap and is so cheap, or it wasn't so cheap, at least in Norway.  So it's been a huge effort to change people's behaviors into buying electrical cars.  And it's been massively successful.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:16:01):**  So I believe Norway with 5 million people, where the country buying most, not per capita,  but the country buying most Teslas for a while, right?  So subsidies.  It was like nine out of 10 new cars were for a while and still are.  So that brings it to a question like if you could change one thing overnight, there's  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:16:20):**  usually a question I ask a bit at the end, but I'm curious now, you have a magic wand,  what would you use it for if you could change one thing overnight?  In the food and agriculture regeneration or in general, would you take all subsidies away?  Would you create that level playing field?  What would you do?  
**[0:16:33-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:16:33):**  Or something completely different?  Your question came up as a result of us talking about subsidies, right?  And I think that's a natural place to put that question.  And I think if you can do something across the board, that will be it.  So there's a number of companies that are working with virtual fencing at the moment.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:16:51):**  So no offense being one of them.  And I think we will all need some time to succeed and to scale and all these things,  right?  But what can accelerate it the most?  Yes, of course, the funding of us and getting more players into the field.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:17:03):**  Sure.  So I think that getting funding for farmers to drive that type of behavior and let virtual  fencing be an enabler for managed racing and regenerative farming.  I think that is the largest thing you could do.  So definitely the magic wand would be used at subsidies for sure.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:17:21):**  And would it be to subsidize, let's say like the Norwegian car example, the good behavior  or the better behavior, or would you be actually more interested if you had any way magic power  to take away all the subsidies in the food and agriculture system that predominantly  are subsidizing the CAFOs, the factory farms, plowing, etc, etc?  What would you target if you had magic power anyway, what would you target?  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:17:42):**  I didn't put one word down, Colin, because we were cheating with you.  Now you said a couple of questions up front, right?  So that magic wand, I put one word in there, I put holistic, I think it's really necessary  to think about these things in a holistic way.  If you do just one thing, it can be a good thing, but it ends up wrong anyway, doesn't  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:18:01):**  it?  So yeah, biodiversity is a good word in terms of regenerative, isn't it?  And I think it's a good principle in general too.  So I would probably try to think about it holistically, try to reduce them.  Also, you've got to give people a chance to change their ways, right?  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:18:15):**  Be able to do that overnight and you need to understand that.  You know Roger's adoptions curve, right?  It says the early innovators and so forth, and the new majority and so on.  And you need to allow some time to take place and not to run in, but trying to think holistically.  And it's funny, isn't it?  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:18:32):**  It's almost like if you buy a new car of a new brand and you don't even notice that brand  before, but when you bought it, you see those cars all over the place, right?  And there's colors, yeah.  And it's a bit the same thing here.  We just started to take interest in these things.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:18:46):**  So my office here in Norway is in a startup environment.  And there's another company in this environment called Desert Control.  They're coming up with a solution for nano clay, which basically does the same thing  as the Nile used to do over the desert in Egypt.  It reduces clay into sand and you can turn sand into fertile soil within weeks.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:19:06):**  It's absolutely mind-blowing what they do.  And I think you need a whole aspect of the life cycle.  So you can't do just virtual fencing.  I think that solves it all.  You need to look at the way pesticides is used and you can't take it all away, right?  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:19:18):**  You can start by maybe trying to administrate in a better way so you don't blow everything  down with pesticides and so forth.  So I think trying to think holistically is the right way to do it.  And then that calls for collaboration.  So helping each other, I think, is an extremely important thing here.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:19:37):**  Not trying just to do your own thing, but have some big ears and a big heart and try  to be part of a movement that takes us in the right direction and be open to that.  There are more roles to roam than one, right?  And what do you see for no offense in your role as well?  Like the next, let's say five years, I mean, next year is always a bit tricky.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:19:58):**  Nobody knows what's going to happen this year, but what do you see as the big milestones  or the big things you're looking forward to work on with the team to get these foundational  blocks for regeneration to scale really after that?  I think we have, we keep saying 10 years left or eight years left or nine years left.  So we have a couple of years to put the foundation blocks in place and then the scale needs to  
**[0:20:18-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:20:18):**  happen.  What are you looking forward to in these foundational years over the next couple of years as virtual  fencing becomes more known, bigger, more players, et cetera.  What are your big looking forward to basically in the next couple of years?  All there's the continuous development of the solution and everything, of course.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:20:34):**  But I feel quite fortunate joining no offense because there's a team that's been working  on this for 10 years, more than 10 years.  So at the moment we actually have more than 150 million hours of operation on animals  that proves that this works.  So for us, it's really to be able to scale our production in a good way.  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:20:57):**  Of the devices, basically.  Of the devices, yes.  Because once that is done, we see that farmers are so happy when they get this solution,  both with regard to their profitability, but also with regard to, what should I say?  I was almost going to say peace of mind.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:21:15):**  It's interesting to see.  So profitability helps with peace of mind for sure.  Yeah, that's true too.  But that wasn't what I was referring to.  You know where your animals are, you know where they are, you know, if they're in danger  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:21:27):**  and you know, if they're predators around, I mean, there's a lot, you know, more from  your phone than if you have to go out there to see and look.  Yeah.  And the combination of the two is so strong.  This is also one of my things that I think is important.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:21:43):**  You know, when something new comes up, it doesn't mean you throw all the old stuff overboard.  You may replace some of it with the new stuff, but you keep a lot of what you know is working  for you.  And I think that is the same way here.  You start using this technology, you're still going to do a lot of the stuff you did before,  
**[0:21:58-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:21:58):**  but there's some you won't have to, and there's some things you can do better.  It has a wide range.  Like I said, the profitability is one thing.  Seeing clients and visiting farmers and hearing them.  So there's one farm in the UK.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:22:11):**  So Hinnos 50.  He used to run his own farm and then he started farming professionally for a landowner who  wanted it or it was prequisite, regenerative.  That's the way to do it.  He went through a journey himself and then he started to sort of see the cost of goods  
**[0:22:27-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:22:27):**  and the stuff.  So the traders coming into the farm, that sort of decreased and his profits were up  and sort of just saw the whole thing unfold.  And he had to sort of pinch his own arm and say like, I'm 50 years old.  It took me this long to sort of come into a city.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:22:42):**  And he knew he wouldn't have done it himself.  He did it because he was farming for someone for the owner.  Right?  Yeah, you need, especially in this period, you need, it's still relatively early, even  though you have 150 million, I just want to say one five, zero plus another six of hours  
**[0:22:57-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:22:57):**  of grazing, which is insane to think about just the amount of data.  What we can see there is mind boggling, but still we're relatively early on in the minds  of many farmers.  So it's, you need the ones that are maybe slightly less motivated by short term profit  that have a bit more space because of other jobs or other successful companies or things  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:23:16):**  just to take the plunge and keep creating those hours and keep pushing the technology  and the boundaries and keep you pushing as well to develop further because we're still  in that early adopted curve very early.  Yeah, yeah, you are.  At the same time, I think also that if you look at the demographics, this is the same  
**[0:23:32-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:23:32):**  all over the world.  The age of the farmer is increasing.  So they're getting older and older and getting the new generation to take over is a common  challenge we all have.  Yeah, I think Gabe Brown used to ask, actually still ask us in rooms like saying, okay, how  
**[0:23:46-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:23:46):**  many here feel like they're successful or how many farmers here in the room see their  younger generation taking over?  And there are very few hands that go up when he asked this question.  And it's very sad because we need those hands.  We need the brains.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:24:00):**  We need the energy.  We do.  We do.  At the same time, also keen windsurfer.  So I went to the beach, actually I started wing foiling now.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:24:07):**  So I went to the beach the other day and then there's one of my work colleagues that comes  in and he has a friend from Sweden, young people, they're like a third my age.  And I told him about my new job and this guy from Sweden, he was a computer programmer  and he was all read up on regenerative and the whole thing.  And he knew all about it.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:24:28):**  So I think there is a growing conscience around these things in the younger generation.  So if they can connect those dots, I truly believe that virtual fencing is an enabler  not only for managed grazing, but also for helping the young generation see that technology  can play a part in making this better and also be cooler.  I think that is also there is an element of that, right?  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:24:55):**  They've grown up, they're digital natives, they've grown up that way and it wouldn't  make sense for them to do it any other way.  So hopefully they're selling online anyway, they're using technology to do many other  things of their farm or their operation.  So why not the management as well?  
**[0:25:10-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:25:10):**  Exactly, exactly.  So if you have done the, let's say you've got the manufacturing under control and the  scale up of that, what are other big pieces you're excited about?  I'm extremely excited to see research developing in this space.  And I'm very humbled also for the situation we're sort of standing up against because  
**[0:25:28-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:25:28):**  there's so many things we need to understand better, right?  And sometimes I have to admit I am getting confused, I'm getting uncertain, I'm getting  bewildered because there's so many things you need to take into consideration.  And then I think what helps me is again, sort of going a bit back to nature and looking  at the way nature designed these things.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:25:46):**  If you sort of try to think that that for starters is okay, then you've got something  to run with.  The methane emissions from livestock, for instance, one thing which is lifted up now  that it's more potent and more dangerous.  So if you can sequester carbon dioxide, well, you reach a lot of methane and then you're  
**[0:26:04-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:26:04):**  back to square one.  Well, are you?  And then if you look at the cycle of the ruminant and that it is releasing methane, well, that  has a cycle, it becomes carbon dioxide and that carbon dioxide is then absorbed again  by the photosynthesis and it sort of goes around.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:26:20):**  So it's part of the circle.  So taking parts of that circle out is kind of, I read about an article about some research  going on, on trying to change the DNA so that the ruminant won't create and build as much  methane as it currently does.  Doesn't sound like a very holistic approach.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:26:41):**  Scares me really.  And what it scared me even more was that the word that was used for that DNA experiment  was to vaccinate the cow against methane emissions.  Again, it's a little bit like if we go back to the first principle of training and muscle,  right?  
**[0:26:57-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:26:57):**  So when you're training it, it's painful.  So if you stop doing that, you kind of have to take the holistic approach, I believe.  It's interesting.  We had a discussion with Ross Konzer of Standard Soil and Blue Nest Beef and he's ex-shell,  knows a lot of things about methane, a lot of things about carbon, a lot of things about  
**[0:27:17-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:27:17):**  oil and fossils and all of that.  And did a very interesting, I think it was, no, it wasn't the TEDx talk.  It was some talk on YouTube.  I will link it below.  And I also linked the interview because we did a deep dive on methane as well.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:27:28):**  And there it was interesting.  First of all, the research is very on the ruminant part is very shaky.  It's very early and much of that.  It's probably like the methane, like how do you even measure it is very interesting, of  course, because it's not that we measure it on cows that are outside.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:27:44):**  Yeah, we use, I mean, it's interesting because everybody uses farting, but actually they're  burping.  And we'll see now that actually the diet of cows has, or ruminants has a huge effect on  the quantity of methane.  So it might even be an effect, like a lot of methane might be an effect of a very bad  
**[0:27:58-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:27:58):**  diet or not an holistic diet, let's say.  So that's one thing too.  And you see people now coming up with LG pills, et cetera, of course, we try to come up with  something to sell and supplement, but probably the research shows that if you have a very  healthy pasture, the method is a lot lower.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:28:12):**  And then there's the very easy argument, but we still have to measure it because it's very  difficult to do that because how do you capture that in the pasture that most of the methane  is actually eaten immediately when the cow burps or the ruminant burps by bacteria that  live in a healthy pasture.  So it's a circle that's very close because they literally burp while they're eating.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:28:29):**  And so it's very interesting that it gets, I'm a bit scared with now the attention for  methane is, is basically becomes like a hammer looking for a nail everywhere.  And it might miss the point, not to say that methane isn't, isn't very dangerous because  you see that, especially from big oil and gas operations, like the methane leaks are  incredibly potent.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:28:47):**  And if we can stop that very interesting, but let's not throw out the baby, like the  ruminant with the bathwater, because it's very, very tricky because we don't know a  lot about it.  We know that in K4 operations, methane is a huge issue, but let's understand why there  and not necessarily in a field.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:05):**  And so, but people get very touchy and feely about it immediately.  Like it's a very sensitive thing.  Like it's another thing to reduce livestock and it doesn't talk about management.  It doesn't talk about pasture.  It doesn't talk about why methane actually comes.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:18):**  Is there a role for methane?  Maybe there is a stressor for the ruminant.  Maybe it's not, maybe it has to do with that diet.  Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.  And we don't know all of these things yet.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:26):**  So it's, it's tricky.  It's interesting, but it's tricky too.  And I get a bit nervous when I see it like, Ooh, this is going to be another, another  nail for the hammer that was already looking for reducing livestock anyway.  And they just found another thing to do it.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:38):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that's why when you say, what is the next thing I'm excited for?  That is research.  And we actually try to do that ourselves.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:46):**  We fund and we work together with the universities around the world and also all the markets  we're entering into to get research in different areas on these things, because that knowledge  is something we need and we don't have all the answers at the moment.  I think this is also important.  And this is also maybe me, as you say, having a lot of experience as we put it, having lived  
**[0:30:07-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:30:07):**  for a while.  I've seen the climate of debate change quite substantially over the last decade or so maybe  half the last half decade.  And I think it's important to listen to people that have very different opinions than you,  and also listen to what can be bad about the methane and where is it and so forth and understand  
**[0:30:27-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:30:27):**  it properly.  Cause it's only if we, if you're willing to listen to each other and talk about it, that's  when we learn.  If you just sort of say what we mean and then the others are wrong, we don't go anywhere.  So the research here, I think is incredibly important that we do get independent research  
**[0:30:43-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:30:43):**  that goes in and checks these things out.  And that scares me a little bit because there are lobbies in this world that work for different  interests.  And so trying to get that peer reviewed research in, I think is incredibly important.  Yeah, no, I saw a very interesting, like YouTube fed me an interesting commercial yesterday  
**[0:31:03-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:31:03):**  of Beyond Meat and it was very well done.  Like it was very interesting and very well about peas and things like that.  And I'm not saying beyond is a huge issue, but it is, yeah, it's a very narrow focus  on the solution and on solutions in general.  And it's interesting that they, I mean, they definitely hired a very good marketing agency  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:31:21):**  because the video was amazing, but yeah, we don't have that yet for, let's say the regenerative  grazing or managed grazing ones.  It's a, it's, we're up against quite a strong lobby on both sides.  I think the CAFO industry is extremely strong and extremely well connected, obviously.  But also I see the vegan side is starting to lobby as well with very interesting, with  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:31:42):**  very interesting funding, which is tricky because we're fighting the same fight.  I have a feeling, but it's, I always have the feeling it's a bit like the fossil fuel  industries that, that really made it very, like they spread so much doubt that they just  delayed, they just played the strategy of delay, delay, delay, delay.  And as long as we are discussing with the vegans, of course there's another day of delay,  
**[0:32:01-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:32:01):**  which means, which means simply delay.  And that's like, we, we really have to get our act together.  And this is, this is such an important, I wouldn't say fight, but certainly important  transition and movement we have to go through, regeneration in general.  And it has to, there's a nice article I will put below as well of David Bronner, the founder  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:32:20):**  of Dr. Or not, not the founder, the current CEO of Dr. Bronner's.  And he wrote like the, they are investing quite a bit in different spaces of the regeneration  space.  So when you think about, think of really vegan company, they are investing in very interesting  things when it comes to livestock.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:32:34):**  And he wrote a full blog post, why they're doing that.  And it's called something like Rejarian's Unite or something, because it's very strong  piece on like, this is a fight we need to do together.  And it's a discussion we need to have together.  And we cannot have discussions among each other because it would just take our eyes  
**[0:32:50-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:32:50):**  of the target and take our, and just delay.  It just makes, I wouldn't say the other side, because that doesn't sound holistic, but it,  it gets us another day away from regeneration, which is simply, we cannot afford that.  We cannot afford to keep discussing about methane in this way or that way.  We have to do the research, obviously, but we also have to go to work because there's  
**[0:33:08-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:33:08):**  so much land to be regenerated and so much ocean as well.  Yeah.  Sorry, it was a bit of a rant.  No, I follow you.  I think the important thing though, is to actually be willing again to listen and embrace  
**[0:33:19-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:33:19):**  them.  Hey, isn't it good then that some people want to be vegan and that they're exploring that  way?  Absolutely.  So there should be room for more ways to do things, I believe.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:33:30):**  And we're trying to do management gatherings and workshops in offense to get the clients.  And we had one, something called Neeadrischindesgor, which is a farm in Norway that had been running  relatively for quite some time now.  And they do both livestock and they do crops and their weight had increased the protein  content by running regeneratively, massively.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:33:55):**  So it shows that you can have a really good protein source in from wheat.  And another story we heard back from one of our clients who had been running regeneratively  for a while and comes back and gets feedback from Norwegian food authorities that his cow  meat had higher omega-3 content than salmon.  So if you're starting to do these things right, I think there's so much potential on both  
**[0:34:18-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:34:18):**  sides that we can get a more diverse option for people to choose what they want to do.  And some people will choose for other reasons that they want to do a vegan diet.  No matter if it's done holistically or not on the livestock side, they will still choose  the vegan and please let them do so.  I think there should be room for both.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:34:39):**  I think we can learn from each other, right?  One of the farmers who visited, they had cover crops with 19% protein in them.  I mean, that's just fantastic.  You had an ox in one of the, the product manager actually for an offense, runs a little farm  and they had a bull there.  
**[0:34:54-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:34:54):**  That bull, 18 months of age gained one kilo per day of meat weight in summer from just  eating grass, like plain walking up and eating grass, converting that into protein at such  a rate.  It's just stunning and amazing.  So you're saying there's so much to discover there on the wheat side, on the protein side,  
**[0:35:16-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:35:16):**  on the cover crop side.  I mean, there's a whole world of potential that we only, I mean, I always say, of course,  it's a pun intended, but scratching the surface.  Yeah.  Oh, you got me on that one.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:35:29):**  There's so many we can make, but it's true.  But it's also difficult in a sector that is run, like many farmers are 50, 60 plus.  They logically are not going to take a lot of risks.  And then we're coming in and saying, oh, everything is possible.  We are only scratching the surface and this and this is possible, will be possible.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:35:46):**  In a couple of years.  And of course the scepticism you can see already in the face going, yeah, there's another one  coming with these amazing stories and the rainbows and the pot of gold and et cetera,  et cetera, and the protein content and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And so how do we don't lose the majority of the farmers, even if they want to in that  
**[0:36:03-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:36:03):**  transition that is going to be painful stuff is going to go wrong.  Like colours full of cows at some point, electricity goes off.  I mean, things like cell reception doesn't go well.  Of course, weather doesn't play with us.  Like how do we not lose them in that transition process?  
**[0:36:19-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:36:19):**  Because that's, I think like if you lose them once, then of course they're not going to  take a risk again because that's their livelihood.  Obviously.  I think you're underestimating the curiosity of people.  I think people are curious.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:36:31):**  And this has been driving humanity ever since the early morning, right.  Of times.  And when there are better ways of doing things that comes across, we also competitive.  So yeah, it's almost to me, almost a Darwinistic aspect of the whole thing, I believe.  We're starting to discover that we messed up also in this area a bit and there's fantastic  
**[0:36:55-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:36:55):**  potential to make that right again.  And here we have an area where we're super capable of doing it, cleaning up the oceans  of microplastic.  That's a tough task.  That's a tough task.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:37:10):**  We've already done so much on that side.  That's irreversible.  But when it comes to regenerative, it is absolutely possible.  And I'm firmly in people's ability to change.  I know the Kubler-Ross curve and that in the beginning there's resistance, right.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:37:28):**  And denial even.  And then there's resistance.  And then you're starting to look at the options and then you're getting committed.  And I think this is the curve that people will go through and they will see it.  But you have to make it available to them and you have to sort of show the possibilities.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:37:42):**  And probably a lot more in the carrot than the stick.  But I also believe that in this situation we actually do have both the carrot and the  stick.  The stick is upon us and it's showing in so many ways.  And you asked it in the beginning, what's the sort of single little thing that makes  
**[0:37:59-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:37:59):**  people have a popping moment, like the whale that was short, right.  And this picture that comes back to me, and I think it is a rose who's grabbing a stick  and grabbing a piece of soil that's been not run regeneratively, but been run like with  heavy tilling and heavy, what do you call it, fertilizing over a long time.  And it's just like sand, right.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:38:18):**  It's just, there's no structure, there's no life in that earth, that soil at all.  And we just start like doping.  If you are not happy with your performance and you do testosterone, you know, you do  enough of that and your own body won't produce it anymore because it just relies on what  you're giving it.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:38:33):**  And then you only have that single ingredient.  And that goes back to the holistic piece.  You need a whole, whole biodiversity in the soil.  I think maybe that is something we should try to have a say, get some smart communication  people to really run on that one because people see and understand immediately when it's like  
**[0:38:51-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:38:51):**  sand and dust, it blows away, right?  No, no.  When you get people on a farm, when you get people on farms and have them, I mean, I remember  a groundswell two years ago, two and a half years ago, like the soil tests are always  funny, the infiltration tests, like different pieces, pieces of soil, some well-managed,  
**[0:39:08-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:39:08):**  some well-graced, some not, and then having X amount of water on top and see what comes  out and if it's very clear that everybody understands what is better or not, what holds  more water, et cetera, et cetera.  So those are floating tests, like putting a piece of soil in a cup of water and see  if it completely falls apart immediately or holds structure well.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:39:25):**  I mean, there's, they're very nice, simple tests everybody can do.  We did an interview with Abby Rose of sector manager of soil mentor that really teaches  farmers or shows farmers with a very simple app, how to do that themselves without any  complicated labs, et cetera.  And so there's a lot we can do there and to see it and touch it and feel it, I think you  
**[0:39:41-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:39:41):**  cannot unsee it anymore.  Like once you've seen the potential of non ploughing or continuous cover, et cetera,  you're going to see ploughed fields, just like the car, you're going to see ploughed  fields everywhere and see like, okay, there's still a lot to do, but then let's switch gears  a bit to the financial side of things.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:39:56):**  So I'm funny, because I'm going to mention that they follow the money.  Look at the money going into this at the moment.  So it's this capital side of things that's really understood that this is a moment that's  happening.  And the whole sustainability piece of investment is almost, yeah.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:40:14):**  With all the issues with that, and we have to track and try and keep people accountable  because people put impact now on everything.  Have you seen that?  I mean, it's been only a few months, but in conversations with investors, as you are starting  to prepare for fundraising, obviously, this is not investment advice.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:40:29):**  It might be very clear.  But have you seen, like, of course, there's interest from investors, I can imagine they  knock on doors, et cetera, but is there a full understanding yet?  Like do they come really, I wouldn't say prepared, but understanding of the potential, but also  the issues and the challenges?  
**[0:40:44-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:40:44):**  Or is there a lot of education you see yourself and others of the team doing still on this  virtual fencing?  Because it is technology, there is scale, but it's also agriculture and food, which  scales always less fast than we hope so.  Do you see there's a huge role for you or are you surprised about, let's say, the knowledge  
**[0:41:01-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:41:01):**  of the investors that have been knocking on your door?  I think there's some wide range.  Very diplomatically.  Very nice.  Yeah.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:41:09):**  There's a wide range.  Some surprises.  I mean, so far, but I haven't met with a lot yet.  We have a lot of income and traffic and, you know, we're 30 people, we're busy as hell.  So we really need to prioritize what do we do and what do we not do.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:41:26):**  So we said no to a lot of meetings as such, but we had a few and probably have more now  and going into 2022, as you say, as we're going to do some fundraising.  And I think that there's a mutual need to understand more.  In my head, there's a few things we already know and we can kind of take for granted and  we can work along the lines of, but then you start drilling down to finding the right KPIs  
**[0:41:52-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:41:52):**  and so forth.  And where do you actually say that these are hard metrics that we follow?  Then it becomes a bit more complicated.  And I think that's an educational role for both the capital side and also for the industry  side.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:42:03):**  So our knowledge is varying for sure.  I think, as you said, there is a bit of repainting going on also.  So you can kind of, at least I feel that you can kind of easily tell if there's a personal,  if there's a corporate or if there's just a PowerPoint type of motivation behind because  it shows in the conversations.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:42:24):**  So getting the people that are willing also to take a bit of a stand, I think is important.  This is something we're going to look for.  We're going to be a huge fan of Hamilton.  I don't know if you heard the musical, but there's a line that says, if you stand for  nothing bird, what do you fall for?  
**[0:42:39-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:42:39):**  And it sort of goes around the line of, well, sometimes in life you have to make some bets,  I left a safe job and an incredible crew at my old company that I'm still missing.  And I'm still sometimes when good vibes come up about no offense, I'm sometimes mixing  the name of my old company and this company because there's sort of the good feelings  that they're the drawers right next to each other.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:43:01):**  So getting this to work in a way where you sort of say, hey, do we believe this is right?  And then be willing to take a leap into it with a number of unknowns.  That is also what's in particular, there's a reason it's called venture capital, isn't  it?  Because they're going out on a venture, they make some bets and it makes them believe something  
**[0:43:22-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:43:22):**  and they think that that is right.  And they try to document as much as they can, but at some stage you need to sort of say,  does it all make sense?  And does it seem likely?  And then the real benefits are there for the people who actually dare to take that risk  
**[0:43:37-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:43:37):**  before it becomes evident to everyone because then the market is efficient and then there's  not the same type of money to be earned or glory to be had.  But yes, there is definitely a difference between them.  The interesting thing is to see that there are a significant amount of funds that really  take this seriously and have made it part of their strategy.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:44:00):**  So it's not just a PowerPoint to follow where.  It is a desire to actually make a change and have it as part of their investment strategy.  What we look for also is a bit of that passion because we believe that on this journey you  need to have more than the money and some skill sets.  You need to have some passion and some drive and your funding partner should be that.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:44:24):**  They should be your funding partner.  That's what we believe at least.  We're not in a situation where we think we know best ourselves.  So we think that having that partnership and of course we will be the executing arm of  that partnership, but having it as a partnership we think is incredibly important.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:44:40):**  What if we switch the tables, meaning you will be on the other side, maybe not talking  to no offense, but you will have a considerable fund to invest, let's say a billion dollars  or a billion euros or a billion Norwegian crowns, no probably that's not the same, but  like a lot of money to invest and could be very long-term investments, but definitely  investments.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:44:58):**  What would you focus on and I'm not interested in the exact dollar amount, but I'm interested  what would you prioritize as if you would switch seats with an investor and you had  a considerable fund to put to work?  I think the number one thing is that you do the exact same thing as everyone else.  That's right.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:45:15):**  You look for a product market fit, you look for the people in that organisation and you  look for their ability to scale and you look for the roadblocks down the road as such.  I don't want to be the boring answer you say and you diversify and do the whole thing,  so that's the boring answer.  That's probably what you should do, but I would probably try to look for areas where  
**[0:45:38-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:45:38):**  you can really make substantial changes to something that hasn't been changed for a long  time, see if there's opportunities there.  I know it sounds a bit coloured from where I come from, but I still think that is right  though.  I think that it disqualifies that point of view.  
**[0:45:56-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:45:56):**  If you can really disrupt the way things have been done for a long time with that investment,  that is interesting.  Yes, there's a high risk to it, but in order to do so, it needs to provide some simple  solutions that are scalable and see how you can really scale that.  So what kind of sectors come up?  
**[0:46:17-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:46:17):**  What kind of pieces of, could be anything, it could be literally anything, what comes  to mind, of course, without doing the super deep research, but what other sectors beyond,  let's say, virtual fencing, are you potentially excited about?  Is it around plastics?  Is it around other things, nutrient density?  
**[0:46:34-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:46:34):**  What other sectors would you, or what other pieces of the food and agriculture sector  obviously as well, which you spend time on investigating?  I think I mentioned that one before, right?  It's almost like it's a parallel to re-density of farming and managed grazing.  It's like you're repeating one of nature's old principles and the certification and the  
**[0:46:55-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:46:55):**  ability to do something about that.  And actually, to mention that specifically though, it's using oil and gas technology  to induce clay into sand.  So it's taking what we've learned and it's taking one of the oldest principles that the  Nile did itself into source holes.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:47:12):**  That would definitely be one area that really has caught my mind.  I'm interested to see what the ocean cleanup, what they're able to do and how that could  be taken further.  I just love the story that it's a country fellow, you, isn't it?  It's a Dutch gentleman.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:47:28):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've met him once actually, Royen Slad.  I don't think he remembers me, but I had a coffee with him when he was really 16, 17  once.  Yeah, right.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:47:38):**  Yeah.  No, but because if you take the desert and you take the ocean, those are the two biggest  areas next to soil, aren't they?  That we haven't been focusing on a lot.  Yeah, because you kind of, when sand is sand, then you can't do anything about it.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:47:52):**  It's kind of a lost cause, right?  But if you can start doing something that at scale, that is interesting.  And then the same thing with the ocean cleanup is if you can do something on the ocean cleanup  site at scale, that is interesting.  I've got faith in that you will be able to stop these three main rivers that are just  
**[0:48:10-0:48:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:48:10):**  feeding plastic into the ocean.  So, and you can stop it at the production sites and so forth.  You got people's consciousness around it.  So I got belief in that you can stop those things.  Just got to take a bit of time, but to clean up what we already messed up, that is an area  
**[0:48:27-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:48:27):**  which if you can really start doing something about that, that is super interesting.  So probably hard.  Well, who cares?  Yeah.  If you can do the hard things, then there's a big reward at the end of the journey.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:48:39):**  I want to thank you.  I'm really conscious of your time.  You're extremely busy and it's going to be an extremely busy year.  So I want to thank you so much for your openness and for your time today to share your story  and what excites you about the opportunity of regeneration, but virtual fencing specifically.  
**[0:48:54-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:48:54):**  Thanks a lot, Colin.

**[0:49:32-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:49:32):**  Thank you so much and see you at the next podcast.  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:49:56-0:50:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:49:56):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been following the space since 2011  and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in this space over the last years?  How have we built our decision making framework?  
**[0:50:15-0:50:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:50:15):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask?  What is happening in this space?  What should you read?  What should you listen?  
**[0:50:25-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:50:25):**  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course?  You the soil builders and investors in this space, the soil builders, people working in  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing,  
**[0:50:39-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:50:39):**  platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line  designers, holistic management consultants, et cetera, et cetera.  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital banks, insurance companies,  
**[0:51:01-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:51:01):**  et cetera.  Is this course free?  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:51:10):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  different means.  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  
**[0:51:25-0:51:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:51:25):**  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  So you don't have to ride along.  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky.  
**[0:51:41-0:51:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:51:41):**  How to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to invest  in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find if  you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:52:00):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:52:14):**  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking, click on  the link below, sign up and I'm really looking forward to your feedback.

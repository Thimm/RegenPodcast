**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:00:14):**  The potential of managed grazing of ruminants is enormous on food quality, protein production,  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:00:19):**  soil carbon, water quality, animal welfare and a lot more.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:00:23):**  So could virtual fencing be the enabler to scale this seriously during the next decade  
**[0:00:28-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:00:28):**  of regeneration?  
**[0:00:29-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:00:29):**  And what is needed for that?  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:00:30):**  This is a conversation with a CEO that has experience in scaling up technology companies  
**[0:00:35-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:00:35):**  and who is coming into the regeneration space.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:00:37):**  We talk about farmers and their stories, profit, methane research and transitions.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:00:45):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:49-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:00:49):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:00:50):**  A podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:00:55):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:01:00):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:01:04):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:01:07):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:11-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:01:11):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:01:13):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers, start paying much more  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:01:18):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:01:22):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:26-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:01:26):**  our work.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:01:27):**  And so many of you have joined as a member.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:01:29):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:01:34):**  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.

**[0:01:47-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:01:47):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:01:49):**  Welcome to another episode of the podcast today, the second in a series of interviews,  
**[0:01:53-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:01:53):**  unpacking the potential of virtual fencing with the team of no fence.  
**[0:01:56-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:01:56):**  And today we have the CEO Knut Benson.  
**[0:01:58-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:01:58):**  Welcome Knut.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:01:59):**  Thanks a lot.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:00):**  Thanks a lot, Koen.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:01):**  And you had a quite a considerable working life before joining a virtual fencing company.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:05):**  So what brought you to that and how did you end up in soil?  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:09):**  It's a good question really.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:10):**  And a quite considerable working life.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:12):**  Yeah, I'm 59.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:13):**  So I didn't want to say you're old.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:15):**  That wasn't my implication, but you have a lot, let's say better.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:19):**  You have a lot of experience.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:20):**  I do.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:21):**  I do.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:22):**  And why did I do it?  
**[0:02:23-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:23):**  I think there's several reasons.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:25):**  It's I have to say just emotionally, I totally fell for the concept when I heard what it  
**[0:02:30-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:30):**  was about.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:31):**  It happened quite traditionally.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:32):**  So I got this call from a headhunter and I'd even misheard the name.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:37):**  So I thought they said it was a company with IOT and virtual.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:40):**  They said, I thought I said no sense.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:42):**  That didn't make any sense to me at all.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:44):**  I didn't understand what it was.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:46):**  No offense.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:47):**  I looked it up.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:48):**  I totally fell for it.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:49):**  Why did I do so?  
**[0:02:50-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:50):**  I guess being at my age and being of my generation, I kind of feel that it's time to give back  
**[0:02:57-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:57):**  a bit to society.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:02:58):**  I feel that consciously or unconsciously, we've been utilizing nature in a way which  
**[0:03:02-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:03:02):**  hasn't been sustainable.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:03:04):**  And being a Norwegian, being brought up and being so fortunate to be in a cabin in the  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:03:10):**  summers, which was way up in the mountains in Norway, going up to local farmer, helping  
**[0:03:14-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:03:14):**  herd in the cows, making the cows and all these things.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:03:17):**  I always had a close connection to agriculture and to farming and to livestock.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:03:22):**  So when this opportunity comes up, it's a Norwegian patent.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:03:27):**  I felt I could use all my experience from the last 14 years and other companies I've  
**[0:03:32-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:03:32):**  been in.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:03:33):**  Well, there was just no question.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:03:35):**  I just had to jump at it.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:03:36):**  So yeah, here I am.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:03:38):**  And how has been the journey?  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:03:39):**  Because it's been since, let's say, summer last year, 2021.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:03:42):**  That's like four or five months.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:03:44):**  How has been this crash course of grazing and fencing?  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:03:47):**  And what's the biggest surprise?  
**[0:03:49-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:03:49):**  I wonder if the biggest surprise in one way was that something I learned as a kid in school  
**[0:03:56-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:03:56):**  about the photosynthesis is so important and that it sort of had been totally off my mind  
**[0:04:04-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:04:04):**  for so many years.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:04:05):**  And I do believe I'm quite a conscious person with regard to nature.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:04:09):**  I'm involved.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:04:10):**  I've been on a board in a foundation that supports prevention of plastic pollution of  
**[0:04:15-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:04:15):**  the ocean.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:04:16):**  I'm a freediver.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:04:17):**  I've been close to nature all my life.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:04:19):**  But seeing and understanding the impacts of that, and also having seen David Attenborough  
**[0:04:25-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:04:25):**  tell me about how the atmosphere actually was made out of the photosynthesis from the  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:04:32):**  algae in the ocean in the beginning, and how the early ruminants like dinosaurs were sort  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:04:37):**  of keeping that whole cycle alive and now seeing how it's done and can be done regenerative  
**[0:04:42-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:04:42):**  and managed racing and silver pasture and so forth.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:04:46):**  It really blew my mind.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:04:47):**  Yeah, I thought, what a fantastic gift to be able to be part of such a journey and contribute.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:04:52):**  For sure, you had to explain it to people that are completely new to, let's say, grazing  
**[0:04:57-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:04:57):**  as well.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:04:58):**  So if you would say, if somebody will knock on the door and says, I'm very interested  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:05:02):**  in nature and photosynthesis, but what does it have to do with grazing?  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:05:06):**  What would be your few sentences to get that hook and then explain?  
**[0:05:10-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:05:10):**  I mean, the complexity is impossible in a few sentences, but to explain enough for that  
**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:05:13):**  person to get super excited or interested to dig further, because that's what I see  
**[0:05:17-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:05:17):**  often on the podcast as well.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:05:19):**  The importance of that simple between brackets concept is mind boggling, but at the same  
**[0:05:24-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:05:24):**  time, you don't want to overload somebody with too much information.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:05:26):**  So how would you, if you meet somebody in the hallway of a conference, which hopefully  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:05:30):**  will happen soon in person, what would be your conversation there if somebody said,  
**[0:05:34-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:05:34):**  I'm interested in the photosynthesis, what does it have to do with grazing?  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:05:36):**  Yeah, I think the number one thing you need to find out, if people actually know what  
**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:05:40):**  the photosynthesis does, right?  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:05:43):**  But the sheer fact that it takes carbon dioxide out of the air and sequestrates carbon and  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:05:48):**  releases oxygen, that whole process, that it's accelerated by grazing.  
**[0:05:53-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:05:53):**  And I think the best explanation I've heard so far is from a fellow here in Norway who  
**[0:06:00-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:06:00):**  also has a podcast.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:06:01):**  And he made the comparison between the way ruminants were grazing back before humans  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:06:05):**  domesticated them and that they were hunted by predators.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:06:09):**  They were herding together in tight little herds, grazing and competing for the food.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:06:13):**  And then they would leave their dumps and then would move on and let the grass rest.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:06:18):**  And that circle of getting stressed and then have rest, just like a muscle.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:06:23):**  If you want to train a muscle, you stress it hard and then you let it rest.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:06:27):**  The problem comes if you overtrain it or you don't train it, that's the same thing with  
**[0:06:32-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:06:32):**  the soil.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:06:33):**  And simply the fact that the bacteria that is in the stomachs of the ruminants actually  
**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:06:38):**  is needed for that circle to go proper on in the soil.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:06:43):**  It just makes total sense.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:06:45):**  Which is very interesting because people would say just that fact that the animal is needed  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:06:51):**  is already a very interesting point that many people overlook.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:06:55):**  Like it's not enough to put a big fence around a nature area that we want to preserve and  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:07:00):**  then hope that it regenerates, which it might do in a certain way.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:07:04):**  But with animals, with ruminants mostly included in that, which could be wild, which could  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:07:08):**  be not, but managed in a certain way, because there it comes back, like it's the management  
**[0:07:12-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:07:12):**  of, it can be sped up considerably or even without that it won't take off entirely.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:07:19):**  Like it's the need of livestock and animals, grazing animals in regeneration.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:07:25):**  Is something that many people didn't get their heads around yet.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:07:27):**  The second question is, should we eat them or not?  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:07:29):**  I think that's a whole different discussion on the vegan side of things, but the use between  
**[0:07:33-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:07:33):**  brackets because I'm not saying it in a bad way of animals as a tool in regeneration is  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:07:37):**  something that we still, I still find many people that completely overlook that.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:07:42):**  Like grass with animals or grass without animals is a very different thing or a forest with  
**[0:07:46-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:07:46):**  or a landscape with or without.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:07:48):**  There's a very different potential in terms of photosynthesis and in terms of does the  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:07:52):**  amount of solar energy we can take and the amount of life biomass, et cetera.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:07:56):**  Do you see that as well?  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:07:58):**  Very often that that surprise like, ah, we actually potentially need animals in this  
**[0:08:02-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:08:02):**  process of regeneration?  
**[0:08:04-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:08:04):**  So far I haven't.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:08:05):**  I don't know.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:08:06):**  Maybe it's because I live in Norway as well, but I think there's a lot of people who are  
**[0:08:10-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:08:10):**  quite close to nature as such there.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:08:12):**  So to see that link quite closely, maybe it's because I speak to people that are in that  
**[0:08:18-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:08:18):**  situation.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:08:19):**  It's very different if I went to some of the gaming halls or whatever and I spoke to young  
**[0:08:23-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:08:23):**  people that aren't that close necessarily.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:08:25):**  I don't know.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:08:26):**  But I think in general, people have a pretty good understanding that nature hasn't really  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:08:33):**  invented a whole lot that is unproductive or goes the wrong way, right?  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:08:38):**  There's a circle of life that makes a lot of sense to most people.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:08:43):**  Maybe by actually also pointing out some of the opposites, you get a lot of understanding.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:08:48):**  So well, over millions of years, nature has developed things like the ruminants, like  
**[0:08:54-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:08:54):**  the cow, for instance, and like the goat.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:08:56):**  And they typically grass in different areas and the giraffe grasses in different areas  
**[0:09:01-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:09:01):**  as well.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:09:02):**  And they're sort of specialized for those specific types of food that they have.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:09:05):**  And that whole ecosystem around them simply works.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:09:08):**  So if you take the opposite, why does it make sense to put a machine between the pasture  
**[0:09:15-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:09:15):**  and the ruminant?  
**[0:09:16-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:09:16):**  That just makes sense.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:09:17):**  So putting the machine between the grass and the cow, when the cow is the most efficient  
**[0:09:21-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:09:21):**  grazing machine there is.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:09:23):**  Yeah, that also helps people intuitively see it, I think.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:09:27):**  But then getting more research into this is clearly a way to help educate everyone, I  
**[0:09:34-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:09:34):**  think, including ourselves, right?  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:09:36):**  We're kind of rediscovering something which has been there for a long time.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:09:40):**  Now, do we need to understand more of it?  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:09:43):**  That's the beauty of science, isn't it?  
**[0:09:44-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:09:44):**  And then the next step is sort of like, you're still talking to that person in the hallway  
**[0:09:48-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:09:48):**  of a conference to the technology to virtual fencing.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:09:52):**  How do you describe that in a few sentences to someone that never heard about it before?  
**[0:09:58-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:09:58):**  And basically never heard about it before?  
**[0:09:59-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:09:59):**  Like, what does that mean?  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:10:00):**  Just like you heard it wrong, maybe the first time like, oh, it's devices, and it makes  
**[0:10:04-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:10:04):**  no sense.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:10:05):**  Like, what would you say that?  
**[0:10:07-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:10:07):**  Well, I try to explain simply what it is.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:10:09):**  And most people heard about it.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:10:11):**  If you told people in urban areas, you know, they know about geofencing of pushbikes, right?  
**[0:10:16-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:10:16):**  So that's basically the same principle, right?  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:10:18):**  You use the GPS, but simply helping them understand that the way you normally would fence.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:10:24):**  And what's in is either a physical fence or an electrical fence.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:10:27):**  And this basically takes that whole concept and attaches it to the animal itself.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:10:32):**  Instead of just letting the animal feel the border of the fence when it hits the barbed  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:10:36):**  wire or hits the electrical fence, you actually have a sound system that gives the animal  
**[0:10:41-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:10:41):**  predictability.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:10:42):**  So before it enters that border, it will hear this beep beep beep beep sound that sort of  
**[0:10:48-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:10:48):**  tells it that here's the border.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:10:50):**  And they learn it so quick.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:10:53):**  To me telling the stories about animals that do this and also this is funny story, you  
**[0:10:58-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:10:58):**  know, see yourself is always the beauty, right?  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:11:00):**  And there's this goat that one of our founders has.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:11:04):**  And it's she's such a clever little girl that goat, she knows where the fence goes, and  
**[0:11:10-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:11:10):**  she passes past it just to grab what she wants.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:11:12):**  And then she turns about and goes back before she gets an impulse.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:11:16):**  So that's how smart these animals are.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:11:18):**  And you see how it works on another one.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:11:21):**  One of the cows is called the fence trimmer because she consistently goes around the fence,  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:11:26):**  you can always trace that particular animal and see where the fence is actually going.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:11:31):**  So telling these stories about how the animals behave when they're using the technology,  
**[0:11:35-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:11:35):**  that's a good thing.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:11:36):**  And then, of course, the app and putting all this in the hands of the farmer.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:11:40):**  So you come with this scale up experience in a very different industry, the virtual  
**[0:11:45-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:11:45):**  conferencing industry.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:11:46):**  I mean, there's the word virtual, but that's all that is.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:11:48):**  And you bring that to agriculture, to land use and to technology, like there is definitely  
**[0:11:52-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:11:52):**  an exponential piece in that definitely a scalable piece.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:11:55):**  But there's also a very old industry, a very large industry.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:11:59):**  What do you see, let's say, what's the biggest barrier?  
**[0:12:02-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:12:02):**  What do you see now?  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:12:03):**  You've been a few months in the company and looking around the sector as for this to really  
**[0:12:08-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:12:08):**  to really take off.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:12:09):**  And like in 10 years, most fencing, or most, let's say most animals are managed in this  
**[0:12:13-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:12:13):**  way.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:12:14):**  Most fencing has disappeared.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:12:15):**  What is stopping from doing that?  
**[0:12:17-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:12:17):**  I think there's many things.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:12:18):**  I think it's hard to sort of pick like one particular thing.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:12:23):**  It's interesting that you mentioned my own industry because video conferencing, I think,  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:12:29):**  really became the big hit when people had to, right?  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:12:33):**  The pandemic hit and the pandemic did more for video conferencing than 20 years of marketing  
**[0:12:38-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:12:38):**  and sales.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:12:39):**  So what do we need for virtual fencing that people have to, is it like a ban on fencing  
**[0:12:45-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:12:45):**  or that suddenly, like what would be that, or is it climate?  
**[0:12:49-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:12:49):**  And like, what would be that push that we might need or farmers might need?  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:12:53):**  I'm almost thinking back three, four, five years when I started free diving and I got  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:12:59):**  into an environment where people were very concerned about plastic pollution in the ocean.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:13:04):**  And then there was a whale that stranded on the coast of Norway that had so many plastic  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:13:10):**  bags inside it, it died because of that.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:13:12):**  It really opened the eyes of the public.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:13:14):**  And then I think almost within a year when people really sort of saw the connection,  
**[0:13:19-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:13:19):**  people were smart.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:13:20):**  People aren't stupid, they're smart.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:13:22):**  So when they see the real connection, then they will act accordingly.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:13:26):**  And this is what happened, I think, when it comes to plastic pollution, you see how society  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:13:30):**  has turned around and made plastic pollution in the ocean like one of the real big things  
**[0:13:35-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:13:35):**  on the agenda.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:13:36):**  I believe that when you start to see what UN says about the rate at which we're losing  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:13:42):**  our topsoil, I think maybe what people need to do is to sort of see the practical aspects  
**[0:13:47-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:13:47):**  of it.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:13:48):**  If you take the whole picture, it almost becomes overwhelming for us all, doesn't it?  
**[0:13:52-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:13:52):**  Too much.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:13:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:13:54):**  Because the topsoil is always interesting, but only for the geeks of us that are deep  
**[0:13:59-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:13:59):**  in it.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:00):**  Like a whale on a beach is filled with plastic or filled with plastic is a very, I mean,  
**[0:14:05-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:05):**  everybody sees that.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:06):**  Like there's no way to look around.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:08):**  And I don't know, I'm not wishing for something like that in regeneration, but do you feel  
**[0:14:14-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:14):**  like what is the moment there?  
**[0:14:15-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:15):**  Maybe there are different moments in different places.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:17):**  Like maybe it's a very local thing, like a certain bushfire that never happened or a  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:20):**  certain heat wave or a certain flood or a certain something that triggers looking differently  
**[0:14:26-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:26):**  at soil.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:27):**  I don't know.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:28):**  I don't know if it's going to be on a country level.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:29):**  I'm thinking what could trigger action around this and action of almost everybody or enough  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:33):**  of a minority that it actually triggers something.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:37):**  We'll look back at that and say, ah, those were the points.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:39):**  I don't know.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:40):**  We won't pick them now probably, but it's like topsoil loses so slow and it's so fast,  
**[0:14:45-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:45):**  but it's so slow.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:46):**  And if you look at it, that it's simply, yeah, it's been going on for 60, 70, sometimes hundreds,  
**[0:14:51-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:51):**  sometimes thousands of years.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:53):**  And yeah, we worried about it, but it's not, it doesn't get on top of the agenda.  
**[0:14:57-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:57):**  True.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:14:58):**  But the political landscape is incredibly important here as well, I believe.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:15:02):**  And I think that when you start to see signs coming with more and more proof, that will  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:15:08):**  also change one of the most important things I think in this whole landscape.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:15:12):**  And that is the way we are running subsidies across agriculture in all nations and continents,  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:15:19):**  because it is a heavily subsidized industry.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:15:23):**  And that is the simplest way to do it.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:15:25):**  Again, like you said, I've been working for a global company now for almost 15 years and  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:15:30):**  traveled a lot to the US, to Asia, Europe.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:15:33):**  And what I've seen is there's such a change when people are doing something about subsidies.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:15:42):**  In the region, electric cars have sort of been the big thing because electrical power  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:15:47):**  was so cheap and is so cheap, or it wasn't so cheap, at least in Norway.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:15:51):**  So it's been a huge effort to change people's behaviors into buying electrical cars.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:15:58):**  And it's been massively successful.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:16:01):**  So I believe Norway with 5 million people, where the country buying most, not per capita,  
**[0:16:06-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:16:06):**  but the country buying most Teslas for a while, right?  
**[0:16:09-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:16:09):**  So subsidies.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:16:12):**  It was like nine out of 10 new cars were for a while and still are.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:16:16):**  So that brings it to a question like if you could change one thing overnight, there's  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:16:20):**  usually a question I ask a bit at the end, but I'm curious now, you have a magic wand,  
**[0:16:24-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:16:24):**  what would you use it for if you could change one thing overnight?  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:16:27):**  In the food and agriculture regeneration or in general, would you take all subsidies away?  
**[0:16:31-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:16:31):**  Would you create that level playing field?  
**[0:16:32-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:16:32):**  What would you do?  
**[0:16:33-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:16:33):**  Or something completely different?  
**[0:16:35-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:16:35):**  Your question came up as a result of us talking about subsidies, right?  
**[0:16:38-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:16:38):**  And I think that's a natural place to put that question.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:16:41):**  And I think if you can do something across the board, that will be it.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:16:46):**  So there's a number of companies that are working with virtual fencing at the moment.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:16:51):**  So no offense being one of them.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:16:53):**  And I think we will all need some time to succeed and to scale and all these things,  
**[0:16:57-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:16:57):**  right?  
**[0:16:58-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:16:58):**  But what can accelerate it the most?  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:16:59):**  Yes, of course, the funding of us and getting more players into the field.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:17:03):**  Sure.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:17:04):**  So I think that getting funding for farmers to drive that type of behavior and let virtual  
**[0:17:10-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:17:10):**  fencing be an enabler for managed racing and regenerative farming.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:17:15):**  I think that is the largest thing you could do.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:17:17):**  So definitely the magic wand would be used at subsidies for sure.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:17:21):**  And would it be to subsidize, let's say like the Norwegian car example, the good behavior  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:17:26):**  or the better behavior, or would you be actually more interested if you had any way magic power  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:17:30):**  to take away all the subsidies in the food and agriculture system that predominantly  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:17:35):**  are subsidizing the CAFOs, the factory farms, plowing, etc, etc?  
**[0:17:40-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:17:40):**  What would you target if you had magic power anyway, what would you target?  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:17:42):**  I didn't put one word down, Colin, because we were cheating with you.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:17:46):**  Now you said a couple of questions up front, right?  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:17:48):**  So that magic wand, I put one word in there, I put holistic, I think it's really necessary  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:17:53):**  to think about these things in a holistic way.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:17:57):**  If you do just one thing, it can be a good thing, but it ends up wrong anyway, doesn't  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:18:01):**  it?  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:18:02):**  So yeah, biodiversity is a good word in terms of regenerative, isn't it?  
**[0:18:06-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:18:06):**  And I think it's a good principle in general too.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:18:08):**  So I would probably try to think about it holistically, try to reduce them.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:18:12):**  Also, you've got to give people a chance to change their ways, right?  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:18:15):**  Be able to do that overnight and you need to understand that.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:18:19):**  You know Roger's adoptions curve, right?  
**[0:18:21-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:18:21):**  It says the early innovators and so forth, and the new majority and so on.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:18:24):**  And you need to allow some time to take place and not to run in, but trying to think holistically.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:18:29):**  And it's funny, isn't it?  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:18:32):**  It's almost like if you buy a new car of a new brand and you don't even notice that brand  
**[0:18:37-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:18:37):**  before, but when you bought it, you see those cars all over the place, right?  
**[0:18:40-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:18:40):**  And there's colors, yeah.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:18:41):**  And it's a bit the same thing here.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:18:43):**  We just started to take interest in these things.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:18:46):**  So my office here in Norway is in a startup environment.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:18:50):**  And there's another company in this environment called Desert Control.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:18:53):**  They're coming up with a solution for nano clay, which basically does the same thing  
**[0:18:58-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:18:58):**  as the Nile used to do over the desert in Egypt.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:19:00):**  It reduces clay into sand and you can turn sand into fertile soil within weeks.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:19:06):**  It's absolutely mind-blowing what they do.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:19:08):**  And I think you need a whole aspect of the life cycle.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:19:11):**  So you can't do just virtual fencing.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:19:13):**  I think that solves it all.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:19:15):**  You need to look at the way pesticides is used and you can't take it all away, right?  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:19:18):**  You can start by maybe trying to administrate in a better way so you don't blow everything  
**[0:19:22-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:19:22):**  down with pesticides and so forth.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:19:24):**  So I think trying to think holistically is the right way to do it.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:19:29):**  And then that calls for collaboration.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:19:31):**  So helping each other, I think, is an extremely important thing here.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:19:37):**  Not trying just to do your own thing, but have some big ears and a big heart and try  
**[0:19:41-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:19:41):**  to be part of a movement that takes us in the right direction and be open to that.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:19:48):**  There are more roles to roam than one, right?  
**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:19:51):**  And what do you see for no offense in your role as well?  
**[0:19:54-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:19:54):**  Like the next, let's say five years, I mean, next year is always a bit tricky.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:19:58):**  Nobody knows what's going to happen this year, but what do you see as the big milestones  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:20:02):**  or the big things you're looking forward to work on with the team to get these foundational  
**[0:20:07-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:20:07):**  blocks for regeneration to scale really after that?  
**[0:20:10-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:20:10):**  I think we have, we keep saying 10 years left or eight years left or nine years left.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:20:14):**  So we have a couple of years to put the foundation blocks in place and then the scale needs to  
**[0:20:18-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:20:18):**  happen.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:20:19):**  What are you looking forward to in these foundational years over the next couple of years as virtual  
**[0:20:23-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:20:23):**  fencing becomes more known, bigger, more players, et cetera.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:20:26):**  What are your big looking forward to basically in the next couple of years?  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:20:30):**  All there's the continuous development of the solution and everything, of course.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:20:34):**  But I feel quite fortunate joining no offense because there's a team that's been working  
**[0:20:39-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:20:39):**  on this for 10 years, more than 10 years.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:20:41):**  So at the moment we actually have more than 150 million hours of operation on animals  
**[0:20:48-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:20:48):**  that proves that this works.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:20:50):**  So for us, it's really to be able to scale our production in a good way.  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:20:57):**  Of the devices, basically.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:20:58):**  Of the devices, yes.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:21:00):**  Because once that is done, we see that farmers are so happy when they get this solution,  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:21:08):**  both with regard to their profitability, but also with regard to, what should I say?  
**[0:21:13-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:21:13):**  I was almost going to say peace of mind.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:21:15):**  It's interesting to see.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:21:16):**  So profitability helps with peace of mind for sure.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:21:19):**  Yeah, that's true too.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:21:20):**  But that wasn't what I was referring to.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:21:23):**  You know where your animals are, you know where they are, you know, if they're in danger  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:21:27):**  and you know, if they're predators around, I mean, there's a lot, you know, more from  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:21:32):**  your phone than if you have to go out there to see and look.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:21:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:21:37):**  And the combination of the two is so strong.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:21:39):**  This is also one of my things that I think is important.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:21:43):**  You know, when something new comes up, it doesn't mean you throw all the old stuff overboard.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:21:48):**  You may replace some of it with the new stuff, but you keep a lot of what you know is working  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:21:51):**  for you.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:21:52):**  And I think that is the same way here.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:21:54):**  You start using this technology, you're still going to do a lot of the stuff you did before,  
**[0:21:58-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:21:58):**  but there's some you won't have to, and there's some things you can do better.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:22:01):**  It has a wide range.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:22:02):**  Like I said, the profitability is one thing.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:22:05):**  Seeing clients and visiting farmers and hearing them.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:22:09):**  So there's one farm in the UK.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:22:11):**  So Hinnos 50.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:22:12):**  He used to run his own farm and then he started farming professionally for a landowner who  
**[0:22:16-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:22:16):**  wanted it or it was prequisite, regenerative.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:22:19):**  That's the way to do it.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:22:22):**  He went through a journey himself and then he started to sort of see the cost of goods  
**[0:22:27-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:22:27):**  and the stuff.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:22:28):**  So the traders coming into the farm, that sort of decreased and his profits were up  
**[0:22:33-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:22:33):**  and sort of just saw the whole thing unfold.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:22:35):**  And he had to sort of pinch his own arm and say like, I'm 50 years old.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:22:39):**  It took me this long to sort of come into a city.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:22:42):**  And he knew he wouldn't have done it himself.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:22:44):**  He did it because he was farming for someone for the owner.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:22:48):**  Right?  
**[0:22:49-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:22:49):**  Yeah, you need, especially in this period, you need, it's still relatively early, even  
**[0:22:52-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:22:52):**  though you have 150 million, I just want to say one five, zero plus another six of hours  
**[0:22:57-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:22:57):**  of grazing, which is insane to think about just the amount of data.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:23:01):**  What we can see there is mind boggling, but still we're relatively early on in the minds  
**[0:23:05-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:23:05):**  of many farmers.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:23:06):**  So it's, you need the ones that are maybe slightly less motivated by short term profit  
**[0:23:11-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:23:11):**  that have a bit more space because of other jobs or other successful companies or things  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:23:16):**  just to take the plunge and keep creating those hours and keep pushing the technology  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:23:20):**  and the boundaries and keep you pushing as well to develop further because we're still  
**[0:23:24-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:23:24):**  in that early adopted curve very early.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:23:26):**  Yeah, yeah, you are.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:23:27):**  At the same time, I think also that if you look at the demographics, this is the same  
**[0:23:32-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:23:32):**  all over the world.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:23:33):**  The age of the farmer is increasing.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:23:36):**  So they're getting older and older and getting the new generation to take over is a common  
**[0:23:40-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:23:40):**  challenge we all have.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:23:41):**  Yeah, I think Gabe Brown used to ask, actually still ask us in rooms like saying, okay, how  
**[0:23:46-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:23:46):**  many here feel like they're successful or how many farmers here in the room see their  
**[0:23:52-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:23:52):**  younger generation taking over?  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:23:53):**  And there are very few hands that go up when he asked this question.  
**[0:23:57-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:23:57):**  And it's very sad because we need those hands.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:23:59):**  We need the brains.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:24:00):**  We need the energy.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:24:01):**  We do.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:24:02):**  We do.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:24:03):**  At the same time, also keen windsurfer.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:24:04):**  So I went to the beach, actually I started wing foiling now.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:24:07):**  So I went to the beach the other day and then there's one of my work colleagues that comes  
**[0:24:11-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:24:11):**  in and he has a friend from Sweden, young people, they're like a third my age.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:24:17):**  And I told him about my new job and this guy from Sweden, he was a computer programmer  
**[0:24:22-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:24:22):**  and he was all read up on regenerative and the whole thing.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:24:26):**  And he knew all about it.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:24:28):**  So I think there is a growing conscience around these things in the younger generation.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:24:34):**  So if they can connect those dots, I truly believe that virtual fencing is an enabler  
**[0:24:40-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:24:40):**  not only for managed grazing, but also for helping the young generation see that technology  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:24:47):**  can play a part in making this better and also be cooler.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:24:52):**  I think that is also there is an element of that, right?  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:24:55):**  They've grown up, they're digital natives, they've grown up that way and it wouldn't  
**[0:24:59-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:24:59):**  make sense for them to do it any other way.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:25:01):**  So hopefully they're selling online anyway, they're using technology to do many other  
**[0:25:05-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:25:05):**  things of their farm or their operation.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:25:08):**  So why not the management as well?  
**[0:25:10-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:25:10):**  Exactly, exactly.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:25:11):**  So if you have done the, let's say you've got the manufacturing under control and the  
**[0:25:16-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:25:16):**  scale up of that, what are other big pieces you're excited about?  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:25:19):**  I'm extremely excited to see research developing in this space.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:25:23):**  And I'm very humbled also for the situation we're sort of standing up against because  
**[0:25:28-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:25:28):**  there's so many things we need to understand better, right?  
**[0:25:32-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:25:32):**  And sometimes I have to admit I am getting confused, I'm getting uncertain, I'm getting  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:25:35):**  bewildered because there's so many things you need to take into consideration.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:25:40):**  And then I think what helps me is again, sort of going a bit back to nature and looking  
**[0:25:44-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:25:44):**  at the way nature designed these things.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:25:46):**  If you sort of try to think that that for starters is okay, then you've got something  
**[0:25:51-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:25:51):**  to run with.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:25:53):**  The methane emissions from livestock, for instance, one thing which is lifted up now  
**[0:25:58-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:25:58):**  that it's more potent and more dangerous.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:26:00):**  So if you can sequester carbon dioxide, well, you reach a lot of methane and then you're  
**[0:26:04-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:26:04):**  back to square one.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:26:05):**  Well, are you?  
**[0:26:07-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:26:07):**  And then if you look at the cycle of the ruminant and that it is releasing methane, well, that  
**[0:26:12-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:26:12):**  has a cycle, it becomes carbon dioxide and that carbon dioxide is then absorbed again  
**[0:26:18-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:26:18):**  by the photosynthesis and it sort of goes around.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:26:20):**  So it's part of the circle.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:26:23):**  So taking parts of that circle out is kind of, I read about an article about some research  
**[0:26:29-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:26:29):**  going on, on trying to change the DNA so that the ruminant won't create and build as much  
**[0:26:37-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:26:37):**  methane as it currently does.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:26:38):**  Doesn't sound like a very holistic approach.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:26:41):**  Scares me really.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:26:42):**  And what it scared me even more was that the word that was used for that DNA experiment  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:26:47):**  was to vaccinate the cow against methane emissions.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:26:51):**  Again, it's a little bit like if we go back to the first principle of training and muscle,  
**[0:26:56-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:26:56):**  right?  
**[0:26:57-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:26:57):**  So when you're training it, it's painful.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:26:59):**  So if you stop doing that, you kind of have to take the holistic approach, I believe.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:27:04):**  It's interesting.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:27:05):**  We had a discussion with Ross Konzer of Standard Soil and Blue Nest Beef and he's ex-shell,  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:27:13):**  knows a lot of things about methane, a lot of things about carbon, a lot of things about  
**[0:27:17-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:27:17):**  oil and fossils and all of that.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:27:19):**  And did a very interesting, I think it was, no, it wasn't the TEDx talk.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:27:22):**  It was some talk on YouTube.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:27:24):**  I will link it below.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:27:25):**  And I also linked the interview because we did a deep dive on methane as well.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:27:28):**  And there it was interesting.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:27:30):**  First of all, the research is very on the ruminant part is very shaky.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:27:34):**  It's very early and much of that.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:27:37):**  It's probably like the methane, like how do you even measure it is very interesting, of  
**[0:27:41-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:27:41):**  course, because it's not that we measure it on cows that are outside.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:27:44):**  Yeah, we use, I mean, it's interesting because everybody uses farting, but actually they're  
**[0:27:48-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:27:48):**  burping.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:27:49):**  And we'll see now that actually the diet of cows has, or ruminants has a huge effect on  
**[0:27:53-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:27:53):**  the quantity of methane.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:27:54):**  So it might even be an effect, like a lot of methane might be an effect of a very bad  
**[0:27:58-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:27:58):**  diet or not an holistic diet, let's say.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:28:00):**  So that's one thing too.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:28:01):**  And you see people now coming up with LG pills, et cetera, of course, we try to come up with  
**[0:28:05-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:28:05):**  something to sell and supplement, but probably the research shows that if you have a very  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:28:08):**  healthy pasture, the method is a lot lower.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:28:12):**  And then there's the very easy argument, but we still have to measure it because it's very  
**[0:28:15-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:28:15):**  difficult to do that because how do you capture that in the pasture that most of the methane  
**[0:28:19-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:28:19):**  is actually eaten immediately when the cow burps or the ruminant burps by bacteria that  
**[0:28:24-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:28:24):**  live in a healthy pasture.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:28:25):**  So it's a circle that's very close because they literally burp while they're eating.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:28:29):**  And so it's very interesting that it gets, I'm a bit scared with now the attention for  
**[0:28:32-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:28:32):**  methane is, is basically becomes like a hammer looking for a nail everywhere.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:28:37):**  And it might miss the point, not to say that methane isn't, isn't very dangerous because  
**[0:28:41-0:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:28:41):**  you see that, especially from big oil and gas operations, like the methane leaks are  
**[0:28:46-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:28:46):**  incredibly potent.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:28:47):**  And if we can stop that very interesting, but let's not throw out the baby, like the  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:28:52):**  ruminant with the bathwater, because it's very, very tricky because we don't know a  
**[0:28:57-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:28:57):**  lot about it.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:28:58):**  We know that in K4 operations, methane is a huge issue, but let's understand why there  
**[0:29:02-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:02):**  and not necessarily in a field.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:05):**  And so, but people get very touchy and feely about it immediately.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:07):**  Like it's a very sensitive thing.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:09):**  Like it's another thing to reduce livestock and it doesn't talk about management.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:13):**  It doesn't talk about pasture.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:14):**  It doesn't talk about why methane actually comes.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:18):**  Is there a role for methane?  
**[0:29:19-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:19):**  Maybe there is a stressor for the ruminant.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:21):**  Maybe it's not, maybe it has to do with that diet.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:23):**  Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:24):**  And we don't know all of these things yet.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:26):**  So it's, it's tricky.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:27):**  It's interesting, but it's tricky too.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:29):**  And I get a bit nervous when I see it like, Ooh, this is going to be another, another  
**[0:29:34-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:34):**  nail for the hammer that was already looking for reducing livestock anyway.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:37):**  And they just found another thing to do it.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:40):**  And that's why when you say, what is the next thing I'm excited for?  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:42):**  That is research.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:43):**  And we actually try to do that ourselves.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:46):**  We fund and we work together with the universities around the world and also all the markets  
**[0:29:50-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:50):**  we're entering into to get research in different areas on these things, because that knowledge  
**[0:29:56-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:56):**  is something we need and we don't have all the answers at the moment.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:29:59):**  I think this is also important.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:30:01):**  And this is also maybe me, as you say, having a lot of experience as we put it, having lived  
**[0:30:07-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:30:07):**  for a while.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:30:08):**  I've seen the climate of debate change quite substantially over the last decade or so maybe  
**[0:30:15-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:30:15):**  half the last half decade.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:30:17):**  And I think it's important to listen to people that have very different opinions than you,  
**[0:30:22-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:30:22):**  and also listen to what can be bad about the methane and where is it and so forth and understand  
**[0:30:27-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:30:27):**  it properly.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:30:28):**  Cause it's only if we, if you're willing to listen to each other and talk about it, that's  
**[0:30:33-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:30:33):**  when we learn.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:30:34):**  If you just sort of say what we mean and then the others are wrong, we don't go anywhere.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:30:39):**  So the research here, I think is incredibly important that we do get independent research  
**[0:30:43-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:30:43):**  that goes in and checks these things out.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:30:46):**  And that scares me a little bit because there are lobbies in this world that work for different  
**[0:30:51-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:30:51):**  interests.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:30:52):**  And so trying to get that peer reviewed research in, I think is incredibly important.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:30:57):**  Yeah, no, I saw a very interesting, like YouTube fed me an interesting commercial yesterday  
**[0:31:03-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:31:03):**  of Beyond Meat and it was very well done.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:31:06):**  Like it was very interesting and very well about peas and things like that.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:31:10):**  And I'm not saying beyond is a huge issue, but it is, yeah, it's a very narrow focus  
**[0:31:14-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:31:14):**  on the solution and on solutions in general.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:31:17):**  And it's interesting that they, I mean, they definitely hired a very good marketing agency  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:31:21):**  because the video was amazing, but yeah, we don't have that yet for, let's say the regenerative  
**[0:31:26-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:31:26):**  grazing or managed grazing ones.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:31:28):**  It's a, it's, we're up against quite a strong lobby on both sides.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:31:32):**  I think the CAFO industry is extremely strong and extremely well connected, obviously.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:31:37):**  But also I see the vegan side is starting to lobby as well with very interesting, with  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:31:42):**  very interesting funding, which is tricky because we're fighting the same fight.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:31:46):**  I have a feeling, but it's, I always have the feeling it's a bit like the fossil fuel  
**[0:31:49-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:31:49):**  industries that, that really made it very, like they spread so much doubt that they just  
**[0:31:54-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:31:54):**  delayed, they just played the strategy of delay, delay, delay, delay.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:31:58):**  And as long as we are discussing with the vegans, of course there's another day of delay,  
**[0:32:01-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:32:01):**  which means, which means simply delay.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:32:04):**  And that's like, we, we really have to get our act together.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:32:07):**  And this is, this is such an important, I wouldn't say fight, but certainly important  
**[0:32:12-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:32:12):**  transition and movement we have to go through, regeneration in general.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:32:15):**  And it has to, there's a nice article I will put below as well of David Bronner, the founder  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:32:20):**  of Dr. Or not, not the founder, the current CEO of Dr. Bronner's.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:32:24):**  And he wrote like the, they are investing quite a bit in different spaces of the regeneration  
**[0:32:28-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:32:28):**  space.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:32:29):**  So when you think about, think of really vegan company, they are investing in very interesting  
**[0:32:32-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:32:32):**  things when it comes to livestock.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:32:34):**  And he wrote a full blog post, why they're doing that.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:32:37):**  And it's called something like Rejarian's Unite or something, because it's very strong  
**[0:32:42-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:32:42):**  piece on like, this is a fight we need to do together.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:32:45):**  And it's a discussion we need to have together.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:32:46):**  And we cannot have discussions among each other because it would just take our eyes  
**[0:32:50-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:32:50):**  of the target and take our, and just delay.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:32:52):**  It just makes, I wouldn't say the other side, because that doesn't sound holistic, but it,  
**[0:32:57-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:32:57):**  it gets us another day away from regeneration, which is simply, we cannot afford that.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:33:01):**  We cannot afford to keep discussing about methane in this way or that way.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:33:05):**  We have to do the research, obviously, but we also have to go to work because there's  
**[0:33:08-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:33:08):**  so much land to be regenerated and so much ocean as well.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:33:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:33:12):**  Sorry, it was a bit of a rant.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:33:13):**  No, I follow you.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:33:14):**  I think the important thing though, is to actually be willing again to listen and embrace  
**[0:33:19-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:33:19):**  them.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:33:20):**  Hey, isn't it good then that some people want to be vegan and that they're exploring that  
**[0:33:24-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:33:24):**  way?  
**[0:33:25-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:33:25):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:33:26):**  So there should be room for more ways to do things, I believe.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:33:30):**  And we're trying to do management gatherings and workshops in offense to get the clients.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:33:37):**  And we had one, something called Neeadrischindesgor, which is a farm in Norway that had been running  
**[0:33:43-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:33:43):**  relatively for quite some time now.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:33:45):**  And they do both livestock and they do crops and their weight had increased the protein  
**[0:33:51-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:33:51):**  content by running regeneratively, massively.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:33:55):**  So it shows that you can have a really good protein source in from wheat.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:33:59):**  And another story we heard back from one of our clients who had been running regeneratively  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:34:04):**  for a while and comes back and gets feedback from Norwegian food authorities that his cow  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:34:09):**  meat had higher omega-3 content than salmon.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:34:13):**  So if you're starting to do these things right, I think there's so much potential on both  
**[0:34:18-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:34:18):**  sides that we can get a more diverse option for people to choose what they want to do.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:34:26):**  And some people will choose for other reasons that they want to do a vegan diet.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:34:30):**  No matter if it's done holistically or not on the livestock side, they will still choose  
**[0:34:34-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:34:34):**  the vegan and please let them do so.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:34:37):**  I think there should be room for both.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:34:39):**  I think we can learn from each other, right?  
**[0:34:41-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:34:41):**  One of the farmers who visited, they had cover crops with 19% protein in them.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:34:44):**  I mean, that's just fantastic.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:34:47):**  You had an ox in one of the, the product manager actually for an offense, runs a little farm  
**[0:34:52-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:34:52):**  and they had a bull there.  
**[0:34:54-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:34:54):**  That bull, 18 months of age gained one kilo per day of meat weight in summer from just  
**[0:35:03-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:35:03):**  eating grass, like plain walking up and eating grass, converting that into protein at such  
**[0:35:09-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:35:09):**  a rate.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:35:10):**  It's just stunning and amazing.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:35:11):**  So you're saying there's so much to discover there on the wheat side, on the protein side,  
**[0:35:16-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:35:16):**  on the cover crop side.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:35:17):**  I mean, there's a whole world of potential that we only, I mean, I always say, of course,  
**[0:35:22-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:35:22):**  it's a pun intended, but scratching the surface.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:35:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:35:25):**  Oh, you got me on that one.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:35:29):**  There's so many we can make, but it's true.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:35:31):**  But it's also difficult in a sector that is run, like many farmers are 50, 60 plus.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:35:38):**  They logically are not going to take a lot of risks.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:35:40):**  And then we're coming in and saying, oh, everything is possible.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:35:43):**  We are only scratching the surface and this and this is possible, will be possible.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:35:46):**  In a couple of years.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:35:47):**  And of course the scepticism you can see already in the face going, yeah, there's another one  
**[0:35:50-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:35:50):**  coming with these amazing stories and the rainbows and the pot of gold and et cetera,  
**[0:35:54-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:35:54):**  et cetera, and the protein content and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:35:57):**  And so how do we don't lose the majority of the farmers, even if they want to in that  
**[0:36:03-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:36:03):**  transition that is going to be painful stuff is going to go wrong.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:36:07):**  Like colours full of cows at some point, electricity goes off.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:36:11):**  I mean, things like cell reception doesn't go well.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:36:14):**  Of course, weather doesn't play with us.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:36:16):**  Like how do we not lose them in that transition process?  
**[0:36:19-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:36:19):**  Because that's, I think like if you lose them once, then of course they're not going to  
**[0:36:22-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:36:22):**  take a risk again because that's their livelihood.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:36:24):**  Obviously.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:36:25):**  I think you're underestimating the curiosity of people.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:36:28):**  I think people are curious.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:36:31):**  And this has been driving humanity ever since the early morning, right.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:36:36):**  Of times.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:36:37):**  And when there are better ways of doing things that comes across, we also competitive.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:36:41):**  So yeah, it's almost to me, almost a Darwinistic aspect of the whole thing, I believe.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:36:49):**  We're starting to discover that we messed up also in this area a bit and there's fantastic  
**[0:36:55-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:36:55):**  potential to make that right again.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:36:58):**  And here we have an area where we're super capable of doing it, cleaning up the oceans  
**[0:37:05-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:37:05):**  of microplastic.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:37:07):**  That's a tough task.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:37:09):**  That's a tough task.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:37:10):**  We've already done so much on that side.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:37:11):**  That's irreversible.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:37:13):**  But when it comes to regenerative, it is absolutely possible.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:37:19):**  And I'm firmly in people's ability to change.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:37:23):**  I know the Kubler-Ross curve and that in the beginning there's resistance, right.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:37:28):**  And denial even.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:37:29):**  And then there's resistance.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:37:30):**  And then you're starting to look at the options and then you're getting committed.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:37:33):**  And I think this is the curve that people will go through and they will see it.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:37:37):**  But you have to make it available to them and you have to sort of show the possibilities.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:37:42):**  And probably a lot more in the carrot than the stick.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:37:45):**  But I also believe that in this situation we actually do have both the carrot and the  
**[0:37:49-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:37:49):**  stick.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:37:50):**  The stick is upon us and it's showing in so many ways.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:37:54):**  And you asked it in the beginning, what's the sort of single little thing that makes  
**[0:37:59-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:37:59):**  people have a popping moment, like the whale that was short, right.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:38:03):**  And this picture that comes back to me, and I think it is a rose who's grabbing a stick  
**[0:38:07-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:38:07):**  and grabbing a piece of soil that's been not run regeneratively, but been run like with  
**[0:38:12-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:38:12):**  heavy tilling and heavy, what do you call it, fertilizing over a long time.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:38:17):**  And it's just like sand, right.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:38:18):**  It's just, there's no structure, there's no life in that earth, that soil at all.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:38:23):**  And we just start like doping.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:38:25):**  If you are not happy with your performance and you do testosterone, you know, you do  
**[0:38:29-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:38:29):**  enough of that and your own body won't produce it anymore because it just relies on what  
**[0:38:32-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:38:32):**  you're giving it.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:38:33):**  And then you only have that single ingredient.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:38:35):**  And that goes back to the holistic piece.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:38:37):**  You need a whole, whole biodiversity in the soil.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:38:40):**  I think maybe that is something we should try to have a say, get some smart communication  
**[0:38:46-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:38:46):**  people to really run on that one because people see and understand immediately when it's like  
**[0:38:51-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:38:51):**  sand and dust, it blows away, right?  
**[0:38:53-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:38:53):**  No, no.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:38:54):**  When you get people on a farm, when you get people on farms and have them, I mean, I remember  
**[0:38:59-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:38:59):**  a groundswell two years ago, two and a half years ago, like the soil tests are always  
**[0:39:03-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:39:03):**  funny, the infiltration tests, like different pieces, pieces of soil, some well-managed,  
**[0:39:08-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:39:08):**  some well-graced, some not, and then having X amount of water on top and see what comes  
**[0:39:12-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:39:12):**  out and if it's very clear that everybody understands what is better or not, what holds  
**[0:39:16-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:39:16):**  more water, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:39:18):**  So those are floating tests, like putting a piece of soil in a cup of water and see  
**[0:39:22-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:39:22):**  if it completely falls apart immediately or holds structure well.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:39:25):**  I mean, there's, they're very nice, simple tests everybody can do.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:39:28):**  We did an interview with Abby Rose of sector manager of soil mentor that really teaches  
**[0:39:33-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:39:33):**  farmers or shows farmers with a very simple app, how to do that themselves without any  
**[0:39:36-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:39:36):**  complicated labs, et cetera.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:39:38):**  And so there's a lot we can do there and to see it and touch it and feel it, I think you  
**[0:39:41-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:39:41):**  cannot unsee it anymore.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:39:42):**  Like once you've seen the potential of non ploughing or continuous cover, et cetera,  
**[0:39:47-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:39:47):**  you're going to see ploughed fields, just like the car, you're going to see ploughed  
**[0:39:49-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:39:49):**  fields everywhere and see like, okay, there's still a lot to do, but then let's switch gears  
**[0:39:54-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:39:54):**  a bit to the financial side of things.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:39:56):**  So I'm funny, because I'm going to mention that they follow the money.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:40:01):**  Look at the money going into this at the moment.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:40:03):**  So it's this capital side of things that's really understood that this is a moment that's  
**[0:40:07-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:40:07):**  happening.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:40:08):**  And the whole sustainability piece of investment is almost, yeah.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:40:14):**  With all the issues with that, and we have to track and try and keep people accountable  
**[0:40:18-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:40:18):**  because people put impact now on everything.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:40:21):**  Have you seen that?  
**[0:40:22-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:40:22):**  I mean, it's been only a few months, but in conversations with investors, as you are starting  
**[0:40:26-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:40:26):**  to prepare for fundraising, obviously, this is not investment advice.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:40:29):**  It might be very clear.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:40:30):**  But have you seen, like, of course, there's interest from investors, I can imagine they  
**[0:40:34-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:40:34):**  knock on doors, et cetera, but is there a full understanding yet?  
**[0:40:37-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:40:37):**  Like do they come really, I wouldn't say prepared, but understanding of the potential, but also  
**[0:40:42-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:40:42):**  the issues and the challenges?  
**[0:40:44-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:40:44):**  Or is there a lot of education you see yourself and others of the team doing still on this  
**[0:40:49-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:40:49):**  virtual fencing?  
**[0:40:50-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:40:50):**  Because it is technology, there is scale, but it's also agriculture and food, which  
**[0:40:53-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:40:53):**  scales always less fast than we hope so.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:40:56):**  Do you see there's a huge role for you or are you surprised about, let's say, the knowledge  
**[0:41:01-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:41:01):**  of the investors that have been knocking on your door?  
**[0:41:03-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:41:03):**  I think there's some wide range.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:41:06):**  Very diplomatically.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:41:07):**  Very nice.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:41:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:41:09):**  There's a wide range.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:41:11):**  Some surprises.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:41:12):**  I mean, so far, but I haven't met with a lot yet.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:41:16):**  We have a lot of income and traffic and, you know, we're 30 people, we're busy as hell.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:41:22):**  So we really need to prioritize what do we do and what do we not do.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:41:26):**  So we said no to a lot of meetings as such, but we had a few and probably have more now  
**[0:41:30-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:41:30):**  and going into 2022, as you say, as we're going to do some fundraising.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:41:35):**  And I think that there's a mutual need to understand more.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:41:42):**  In my head, there's a few things we already know and we can kind of take for granted and  
**[0:41:46-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:41:46):**  we can work along the lines of, but then you start drilling down to finding the right KPIs  
**[0:41:52-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:41:52):**  and so forth.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:41:53):**  And where do you actually say that these are hard metrics that we follow?  
**[0:41:56-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:41:56):**  Then it becomes a bit more complicated.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:41:57):**  And I think that's an educational role for both the capital side and also for the industry  
**[0:42:02-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:42:02):**  side.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:42:03):**  So our knowledge is varying for sure.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:42:06):**  I think, as you said, there is a bit of repainting going on also.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:42:10):**  So you can kind of, at least I feel that you can kind of easily tell if there's a personal,  
**[0:42:16-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:42:16):**  if there's a corporate or if there's just a PowerPoint type of motivation behind because  
**[0:42:22-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:42:22):**  it shows in the conversations.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:42:24):**  So getting the people that are willing also to take a bit of a stand, I think is important.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:42:30):**  This is something we're going to look for.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:42:32):**  We're going to be a huge fan of Hamilton.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:42:34):**  I don't know if you heard the musical, but there's a line that says, if you stand for  
**[0:42:37-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:42:37):**  nothing bird, what do you fall for?  
**[0:42:39-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:42:39):**  And it sort of goes around the line of, well, sometimes in life you have to make some bets,  
**[0:42:45-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:42:45):**  I left a safe job and an incredible crew at my old company that I'm still missing.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:42:51):**  And I'm still sometimes when good vibes come up about no offense, I'm sometimes mixing  
**[0:42:55-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:42:55):**  the name of my old company and this company because there's sort of the good feelings  
**[0:42:59-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:42:59):**  that they're the drawers right next to each other.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:43:01):**  So getting this to work in a way where you sort of say, hey, do we believe this is right?  
**[0:43:09-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:43:09):**  And then be willing to take a leap into it with a number of unknowns.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:43:15):**  That is also what's in particular, there's a reason it's called venture capital, isn't  
**[0:43:19-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:43:19):**  it?  
**[0:43:20-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:43:20):**  Because they're going out on a venture, they make some bets and it makes them believe something  
**[0:43:22-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:43:22):**  and they think that that is right.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:43:23):**  And they try to document as much as they can, but at some stage you need to sort of say,  
**[0:43:28-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:43:28):**  does it all make sense?  
**[0:43:30-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:43:30):**  And does it seem likely?  
**[0:43:31-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:43:31):**  And then the real benefits are there for the people who actually dare to take that risk  
**[0:43:37-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:43:37):**  before it becomes evident to everyone because then the market is efficient and then there's  
**[0:43:41-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:43:41):**  not the same type of money to be earned or glory to be had.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:43:46):**  But yes, there is definitely a difference between them.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:43:49):**  The interesting thing is to see that there are a significant amount of funds that really  
**[0:43:57-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:43:57):**  take this seriously and have made it part of their strategy.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:44:00):**  So it's not just a PowerPoint to follow where.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:44:03):**  It is a desire to actually make a change and have it as part of their investment strategy.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:44:10):**  What we look for also is a bit of that passion because we believe that on this journey you  
**[0:44:18-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:44:18):**  need to have more than the money and some skill sets.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:44:20):**  You need to have some passion and some drive and your funding partner should be that.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:44:24):**  They should be your funding partner.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:44:26):**  That's what we believe at least.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:44:28):**  We're not in a situation where we think we know best ourselves.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:44:30):**  So we think that having that partnership and of course we will be the executing arm of  
**[0:44:36-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:44:36):**  that partnership, but having it as a partnership we think is incredibly important.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:44:40):**  What if we switch the tables, meaning you will be on the other side, maybe not talking  
**[0:44:45-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:44:45):**  to no offense, but you will have a considerable fund to invest, let's say a billion dollars  
**[0:44:49-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:44:49):**  or a billion euros or a billion Norwegian crowns, no probably that's not the same, but  
**[0:44:53-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:44:53):**  like a lot of money to invest and could be very long-term investments, but definitely  
**[0:44:57-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:44:57):**  investments.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:44:58):**  What would you focus on and I'm not interested in the exact dollar amount, but I'm interested  
**[0:45:04-0:45:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:45:04):**  what would you prioritize as if you would switch seats with an investor and you had  
**[0:45:08-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:45:08):**  a considerable fund to put to work?  
**[0:45:11-0:45:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:45:11):**  I think the number one thing is that you do the exact same thing as everyone else.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:45:14):**  That's right.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:45:15):**  You look for a product market fit, you look for the people in that organisation and you  
**[0:45:18-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:45:18):**  look for their ability to scale and you look for the roadblocks down the road as such.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:45:25):**  I don't want to be the boring answer you say and you diversify and do the whole thing,  
**[0:45:32-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:45:32):**  so that's the boring answer.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:45:33):**  That's probably what you should do, but I would probably try to look for areas where  
**[0:45:38-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:45:38):**  you can really make substantial changes to something that hasn't been changed for a long  
**[0:45:45-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:45:45):**  time, see if there's opportunities there.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:45:48):**  I know it sounds a bit coloured from where I come from, but I still think that is right  
**[0:45:52-0:45:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:45:52):**  though.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:45:53):**  I think that it disqualifies that point of view.  
**[0:45:56-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:45:56):**  If you can really disrupt the way things have been done for a long time with that investment,  
**[0:46:02-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:46:02):**  that is interesting.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:46:04):**  Yes, there's a high risk to it, but in order to do so, it needs to provide some simple  
**[0:46:11-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:46:11):**  solutions that are scalable and see how you can really scale that.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:46:15):**  So what kind of sectors come up?  
**[0:46:17-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:46:17):**  What kind of pieces of, could be anything, it could be literally anything, what comes  
**[0:46:22-0:46:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:46:22):**  to mind, of course, without doing the super deep research, but what other sectors beyond,  
**[0:46:27-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:46:27):**  let's say, virtual fencing, are you potentially excited about?  
**[0:46:30-0:46:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:46:30):**  Is it around plastics?  
**[0:46:32-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:46:32):**  Is it around other things, nutrient density?  
**[0:46:34-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:46:34):**  What other sectors would you, or what other pieces of the food and agriculture sector  
**[0:46:38-0:46:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:46:38):**  obviously as well, which you spend time on investigating?  
**[0:46:41-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:46:41):**  I think I mentioned that one before, right?  
**[0:46:45-0:46:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:46:45):**  It's almost like it's a parallel to re-density of farming and managed grazing.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:46:50):**  It's like you're repeating one of nature's old principles and the certification and the  
**[0:46:55-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:46:55):**  ability to do something about that.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:46:57):**  And actually, to mention that specifically though, it's using oil and gas technology  
**[0:47:02-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:47:02):**  to induce clay into sand.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:47:05):**  So it's taking what we've learned and it's taking one of the oldest principles that the  
**[0:47:09-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:47:09):**  Nile did itself into source holes.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:47:12):**  That would definitely be one area that really has caught my mind.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:47:16):**  I'm interested to see what the ocean cleanup, what they're able to do and how that could  
**[0:47:21-0:47:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:47:21):**  be taken further.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:47:22):**  I just love the story that it's a country fellow, you, isn't it?  
**[0:47:27-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:47:27):**  It's a Dutch gentleman.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:47:28):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:47:29):**  I've met him once actually, Royen Slad.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:47:31):**  I don't think he remembers me, but I had a coffee with him when he was really 16, 17  
**[0:47:36-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:47:36):**  once.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:47:37):**  Yeah, right.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:47:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:47:39):**  No, but because if you take the desert and you take the ocean, those are the two biggest  
**[0:47:43-0:47:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:47:43):**  areas next to soil, aren't they?  
**[0:47:46-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:47:46):**  That we haven't been focusing on a lot.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:47:48):**  Yeah, because you kind of, when sand is sand, then you can't do anything about it.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:47:52):**  It's kind of a lost cause, right?  
**[0:47:53-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:47:53):**  But if you can start doing something that at scale, that is interesting.  
**[0:47:57-0:48:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:47:57):**  And then the same thing with the ocean cleanup is if you can do something on the ocean cleanup  
**[0:48:02-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:48:02):**  site at scale, that is interesting.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:48:04):**  I've got faith in that you will be able to stop these three main rivers that are just  
**[0:48:10-0:48:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:48:10):**  feeding plastic into the ocean.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:48:13):**  So, and you can stop it at the production sites and so forth.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:48:16):**  You got people's consciousness around it.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:48:18):**  So I got belief in that you can stop those things.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:48:21):**  Just got to take a bit of time, but to clean up what we already messed up, that is an area  
**[0:48:27-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:48:27):**  which if you can really start doing something about that, that is super interesting.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:48:31):**  So probably hard.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:48:32):**  Well, who cares?  
**[0:48:34-0:48:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:48:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:48:35):**  If you can do the hard things, then there's a big reward at the end of the journey.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:48:39):**  I want to thank you.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:48:40):**  I'm really conscious of your time.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:48:41):**  You're extremely busy and it's going to be an extremely busy year.

**[0:49:46-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:49:46):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating

**[0:51:33-0:51:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:51:33):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:51:35):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:51:40-0:51:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:51:40):**  is so risky.  
**[0:51:41-0:51:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:51:41):**  How to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to invest  
**[0:51:46-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:51:46):**  in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find if  
**[0:51:50-0:51:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:51:50):**  you're a soil builder.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:51:52):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:51:56-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:51:56):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.

**[0:52:05-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:52:05):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:52:06-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:52:06):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:52:08):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:52:11):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/knut-bentzen#t=0:52:14):**  It's also not investment advice.

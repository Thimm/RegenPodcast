**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:00:13):**  Provenance is absolutely key and time kills food.  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:00:17):**  Plus soil amendments are the off-ramps from extractive agriculture and why we need to  
**[0:00:22-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:00:22):**  be able to go long on investments.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:00:24):**  And we talk a lot about carbon, but water is actually everything.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:00:28):**  And why we don't focus enough on regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:00:31):**  This and so much more we cover in this interview with a co-founder of Trailhead Capital, Tripp.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:00:36):**  So get a cup of tea.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:00:37):**  It's over an hour, but I think very enjoyable.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:00:41):**  And so enjoy.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:00:44):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:49-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:00:49):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:00:50):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:54-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:00:54):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work, to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:01:00):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:01:04):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:01:06):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:10-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:01:10):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:01:13):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:01:18):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:01:22):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:26-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:01:26):**  our work.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:01:27):**  And so many of you have joined as a member.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:01:29):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q and A webinars with former

**[0:01:49-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:01:49):**  Welcome to another interview today with the co-founder of Trailhead Capital, Trip Wohl.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:01:52):**  Welcome Trip.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:01:53):**  Hi Koon, really a pleasure to be here.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:01:55):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:01:56):**  To start with a personal question, which I always love to ask, how did you end up building  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:02:02):**  soil, regenerating soil, focusing your professional and probably also your private time pretty  
**[0:02:06-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:02:06):**  much on regeneration?  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:02:07):**  Yeah, you know, it's been a circuitous journey, but I really,  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:02:12):**  What does circuitous mean?  
**[0:02:13-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:02:13):**  I think of wandering, a long wandering one, but I don't know the word.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:02:16):**  A long wandering journey with lots of tangents.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:02:20):**  And so I come from a timber and cattle lineage and a host of entrepreneurs.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:02:26):**  And so I've really always,  
**[0:02:28-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:02:28):**  That makes a lot of sense what you're doing.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:02:30):**  It all came back, but it's like I said, it hopefully it'll be coherent by the end, but  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:02:36):**  so I've always loved, I've always loved being outside, outdoors and had a real place in  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:02:41):**  my heart for animals and, and just really wanted that to be a part of my world.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:02:45):**  So I've always been involved in clubs and nonprofits that were in and around that.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:02:50):**  And I, for the last 15 years have been chairman and president of the Colorado, Colorado wildlife  
**[0:02:56-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:02:56):**  foundation.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:02:57):**  And then I am on the, the governor's Western States water conservation partnership.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:03:03):**  So I have long tried to make a difference in flora, fauna, and the way that they interacted  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:03:10):**  from a philanthropic perspective and really decided that that wasn't catalytic enough.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:03:16):**  And so in my professional life, I was at a large asset manager called Alliance Bernstein,  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:03:22):**  where I worked on alternative assets, private wealth and ESG.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:03:27):**  And I really wanted to be able to bring those financial chops, if you will, of, of investing  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:03:33):**  in and across private and public platforms to bear in what I saw was a really sort of  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:03:39):**  glacial and slow path to regeneration through the nonprofits.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:03:44):**  I still champion that work and I'm still involved deeply in water really as a focus in animals.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:03:50):**  But I really wanted to bring my capital capabilities into a space where I thought it needed additional  
**[0:03:58-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:03:58):**  resources.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:03:59):**  And so that was really the genesis of Trailhead was pulling that together and seeing a piece  
**[0:04:05-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:04:05):**  of the spectrum where entrepreneurs and science were really at the vanguard.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:04:11):**  And we wanted to be catalytic and be able to put capital with those innovations, with  
**[0:04:16-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:04:16):**  those ideas and steward them to build this asset class.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:04:19):**  And so really that's with my partners, Mark Lewis and Bobby Pelz and Pete Oberle, what  
**[0:04:24-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:04:24):**  we've endeavored to do.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:04:25):**  Do you remember if there was a specific point or when you were bitten by the regeneration  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:04:29):**  bug, or because some people can point at a very specific, I don't know, movie they saw  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:04:33):**  or a book they read or just because they grew up on a farm and they saw what was possible  
**[0:04:39-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:04:39):**  or was it a slow process in your case?  
**[0:04:42-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:04:42):**  Was it something, was it a meeting, a coffee with somebody?  
**[0:04:45-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:04:45):**  What was the trigger when you couldn't let go anywhere?  
**[0:04:49-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:04:49):**  Because you could have focused on sustainable ag and food, you could have focused on renewable  
**[0:04:52-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:04:52):**  energy, you could have focused on mobility.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:04:54):**  I mean, there are a lot of Catholic places where you could have spent your time and your  
**[0:04:59-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:04:59):**  knowledge in terms of the financial world.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:05:01):**  But you decided to focus it on a very specific part of the food sector.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:05:05):**  So I think I'll go back a little bit to my, what was a philosophy degree at CU.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:05:11):**  And I did my graduate work also in axiology and phenomenology.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:05:16):**  And so I really, you know, like my partners began reading and really being influenced  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:05:21):**  by you know, the Herman Daly's, the David Montgomery's, the Paul Greenberg's and then  
**[0:05:27-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:05:27):**  the Rudolf Steiner's for me.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:05:29):**  So as a philosophy major, I really sort of, you know, delve deep into Steinerian philosophy,  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:05:35):**  anthroposophic medicine, certainly biodynamics.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:05:39):**  And then, you know, the pedagogical format that he put together called Waldorf schools,  
**[0:05:43-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:05:43):**  which all my children went to.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:05:45):**  And so it really began to be ingratiated and thinking about how, you know, I wanted to  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:05:52):**  really sort of deconstruct the industrial food complex as we knew it.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:05:58):**  And so actually my straight path there Coon was that when I left Alliance Bernstein, I  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:06:04):**  bought an independent grocery chain, organic grocery chain.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:06:09):**  That was one of the first movers in the space in the early seventies.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:06:12):**  And because of the whole foods IPO, they had to divest some of their brands and we bought  
**[0:06:18-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:06:18):**  this brand and reopened it.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:06:20):**  And so I really started there by trying to procure locally, know all of my suppliers.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:06:27):**  You know, I really was getting out of trying to have an intermediary, like a UNFI or a  
**[0:06:34-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:06:34):**  Cisco.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:06:35):**  I wanted to have a community and a tapestry that was with our local water, with our local  
**[0:06:41-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:06:41):**  producers, with our local ranchers.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:06:43):**  And so we opened up the back of the store and let anybody who had the provenance and  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:06:49):**  was doing the right things and their organic papers, or if we knew what they were doing,  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:06:54):**  we would go to their farm and if they were doing biodynamic practices, but not certified,  
**[0:06:58-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:06:58):**  we put it on the shelf.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:06:59):**  And so that was really my first foray into understanding how we needed to have a supply  
**[0:07:05-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:07:05):**  chain deconstruction and really where the value and the margin expansion of being able  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:07:12):**  to take out those middlemen could be incredibly accretive to two groups.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:07:16):**  One were the stewards of the land who, and I told you from my history, I had seen, you  
**[0:07:22-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:07:22):**  know, take 50 cents out of every dollar to be able to have a living wage to do this work  
**[0:07:27-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:07:27):**  on the land in the 1950s to what is, you know, under 10 cents today and a very hard slogged  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:07:34):**  business of which no second and third generation wants to be a part of.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:07:38):**  And so, you know, for me, we really want to champion those folks, men and women who stay  
**[0:07:44-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:07:44):**  on the land and steward the land and the right methodologies.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:07:47):**  And so let's let there be a living wage and premiums on that side, cost reductions and  
**[0:07:52-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:07:52):**  new income streams.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:07:54):**  On the other side, let's let nutrient dense, fresh local food be accessible for everybody,  
**[0:08:00-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:08:00):**  right?  
**[0:08:01-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:08:01):**  Not just the affluent or the 1%.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:08:03):**  And I think for me, the sort of epiphany of regeneration was thinking about that circularity  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:08:09):**  and thinking about how the interconnectivity of our food supply, of our planetary and human  
**[0:08:14-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:08:14):**  health really all focused right around this medium called soil.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:08:20):**  And so for me, that became incredibly profound.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:08:24):**  And we started looking at how can we create vertical farms, regenerative farms that we  
**[0:08:29-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:08:29):**  could then supply the grocery chains so that we could be using our bio photonic principles  
**[0:08:36-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:08:36):**  of sun and soil to create biodiverse local supply chain, you know, that really started  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:08:43):**  to solve for the human maladies and the environmental maladies that we know persist.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:08:49):**  So that was sort of this part of the circle.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:08:52):**  Just to unpack that piece a bit, I'm super curious.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:08:55):**  Why did you choose to buy a food chain after you left at that company?  
**[0:09:00-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:09:00):**  Because you could have gotten into any other direction.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:09:02):**  And yes, you care deeply about the water and deeply about the animals, but that not necessarily  
**[0:09:06-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:09:06):**  leads always to buying a food chain out of whole foods.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:09:09):**  Like what was that trigger into that focus on food and ag instead of land, which could  
**[0:09:14-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:09:14):**  have been, you could set up an NGO, you could join an NGO.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:09:17):**  You could have, I don't know, set up a national park, do a lot of other things to protect  
**[0:09:21-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:09:21):**  water and animals.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:09:22):**  What led you into that very active role of matching demand and supply through the backend  
**[0:09:28-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:09:28):**  of a supermarket and the front end and the shelves?  
**[0:09:30-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:09:30):**  No, it's a great connecting question because I had a baseline of naturalist sort of environmentalist  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:09:39):**  or you could have gone into education with Waldorf and rolled that out over the US.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:09:44):**  And I mean, there was a lot of work to do in that intro you mentioned.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:09:46):**  So I really what it was in it, my entry point is very similar to some other people's.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:09:51):**  I was an athlete and so I care deeply.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:09:54):**  I was a cyclist, still am and a skier and care deeply about my performance.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:09:59):**  And that then coincided with the birth of my children.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:10:02):**  And those two things were really pretty instrumental in the way I decided to think about the food  
**[0:10:07-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:10:07):**  system and what I was putting in my body.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:10:09):**  And once I started thinking about that, I couldn't stop thinking about the full provenance  
**[0:10:16-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:10:16):**  and where it came from.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:10:18):**  And so that path is, you know, it's fairly circular.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:10:21):**  And so that's why I said where I can actually make a difference is in the consumer demand  
**[0:10:27-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:10:27):**  side and by offering products and helping educate the consumer through the food about,  
**[0:10:34-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:10:34):**  you know, what they're doing to the land and what they're doing to the stewards of the  
**[0:10:37-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:10:37):**  land.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:10:38):**  And really for me, it's about the ethics and the axiology of your dollars, your spending  
**[0:10:42-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:10:42):**  and your investment, which we can talk about a little bit later.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:10:45):**  And so how is that chain?  
**[0:10:47-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:10:47):**  Is it still around?  
**[0:10:48-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:10:48):**  I haven't picked up the, I should have done my homework on this.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:10:50):**  How has that process been since like, when was the IPO of Whole Foods Xtremor?  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:10:54):**  When did you buy that asset and how long have you been involved in that before or even still  
**[0:10:58-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:10:58):**  when you were setting up Trailhead?  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:11:00):**  Yes, so sadly went the way of the dodo during the COVID crisis.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:11:06):**  I had left as CEO previously and so sort of the next management team wound it down.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:11:13):**  But it was an amazing journey that I was involved with because this was a brand that was actually  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:11:18):**  in Boulder and that I grew up eating from.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:11:22):**  My parents took me in Denver and Boulder in the late 70s and 80s to these stores.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:11:27):**  And it was a very unique experience.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:11:30):**  And so it was super differentiated from anything else.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:11:32):**  And that's really what I wanted to try to bring back because everything had been so  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:11:37):**  processed packaged and just truncated from a diversity standpoint.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:11:42):**  It's a theme you're going to hear everywhere, but I wanted to give consumers more choice  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:11:46):**  with good stuff and allow them to understand the nutrient density and then the provenance  
**[0:11:52-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:11:52):**  of where this stuff came from.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:11:53):**  And unfortunately COVID, even with slightly bigger margins and with more space didn't,  
**[0:11:59-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:11:59):**  even though supermarkets went, I mean, the sales went through the roof, right?  
**[0:12:02-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:12:02):**  I mean, people started lining up, et cetera.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:12:04):**  What triggered then simply they just didn't make it?  
**[0:12:07-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:12:07):**  Well, it was a really, it was a couple of things.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:12:09):**  So we were really based in a college town.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:12:13):**  And so CU is a huge demographic base for us.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:12:17):**  And obviously all of the schools went dark.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:12:20):**  So that was very difficult for us.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:12:21):**  And then we didn't have sort of the omni-channel strategy that I was trying to build.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:12:27):**  We just hadn't gotten there yet.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:12:28):**  So we weren't able to deliver and meet people where they were.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:12:32):**  And we had been running on procuring regenerative and beyond organic products sort of exclusively.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:12:40):**  And so our margins and our volumes were very different than the Kroger's of the world that  
**[0:12:46-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:12:46):**  just do large, large numbers.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:12:49):**  And so it was just, it was a hard place to be.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:12:50):**  I still hold out that there is a lot of great retail like Erewhon that is out there making  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:12:57):**  a real difference in differentiating that food supply, because I think the consumers  
**[0:13:02-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:13:02):**  are starting to demand it with their education.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:13:04):**  So let's switch gears a bit to Trailhead.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:13:06):**  What we obviously, and I will link it in the description below, interviewed Mark Lewis,  
**[0:13:11-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:13:11):**  your co-founder, one of your co-founders.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:13:13):**  How would you describe for anybody that didn't listen to that interview, how would you describe  
**[0:13:17-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:13:17):**  Trailhead and your role specifically?  
**[0:13:19-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:13:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:13:20):**  So I mean, Trailhead is a venture capital firm that is really trying to break the mold  
**[0:13:27-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:13:27):**  of venture capital by being a B Corp, by impact reporting, both socially and environmentally,  
**[0:13:35-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:13:35):**  and by changing the horizon of patient capital with which we can wrap our entrepreneurs with  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:13:41):**  a continuum that's on their timeframe, not an artificial market timeframe.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:13:46):**  So those are three pretty different pillars in VC.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:13:50):**  And so we really started Trailhead to be in a place in the early spectrum where the ideas  
**[0:13:56-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:13:56):**  and the innovations, the institutions and academia are on the forefront of science,  
**[0:14:03-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:14:03):**  of supply chain, of waste reduction, of transparency and traceability.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:14:10):**  And there's just no institutional capital really from a large asset class perspective  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:14:16):**  moving into those regenerative companies.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:14:19):**  And so we really want to build that path and that architecture to make this an institutionally  
**[0:14:24-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:14:24):**  investable class.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:14:25):**  And when you talk about that third pillar of time, does that mean you run on a different  
**[0:14:31-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:14:31):**  schedule, like not the 10 plus two or the 10 plus one in terms of VC funds, because  
**[0:14:36-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:14:36):**  that's often one of the critiques is they have a few years to invest, then they don't  
**[0:14:41-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:14:41):**  do anything for a while.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:14:43):**  And of course they add a lot of other companies and then they need to divest quite forcefully  
**[0:14:48-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:14:48):**  at some point, usually not at the time that makes sense for the company or I mean, you  
**[0:14:52-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:14:52):**  need a lot of luck to, for the, an exit that makes sense both for the company and the VC  
**[0:14:56-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:14:56):**  fund, which creates a lot of tension.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:14:58):**  Have you figured out a way to get around that, that time horizon, which comes back in and  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:15:03):**  back again in the podcast as being too short or not enough, although we might have 10 years  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:15:07):**  to fix a lot of these things, which is a counter argument, like let's get going as soon as  
**[0:15:11-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:15:11):**  possible.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:15:12):**  What has happened there in terms in Trailhead Capital?  
**[0:15:14-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:15:14):**  I mean, for sure you had a lot of discussions on that.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:15:16):**  Well, and we, you know, we're very attuned to the natural cycles, you know, which aren't  
**[0:15:22-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:15:22):**  artificially in decade blocks.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:15:24):**  And so I think, you know, what we've built is yes, our LPs understand that we have extension  
**[0:15:30-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:15:30):**  capabilities to the fund.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:15:31):**  So it is a typical 10 year life cycle to the fund, but we've built in extensions and then  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:15:37):**  the ability to roll into what will be fun too, so that we're not forced into making  
**[0:15:42-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:15:42):**  those decisions.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:15:43):**  The interesting thing I will tell you about this particular time and place Coon is that  
**[0:15:47-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:15:47):**  we're actually fighting the opposite.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:15:49):**  We actually have an offer in a portfolio company that we've been invested in for less than  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:15:54):**  a year that's on the table that we're a little bit hesitant to.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:15:58):**  We're not the majority party, but it's a little quick for us.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:16:02):**  We really would like to mentor and steward and be more active in bringing value to that  
**[0:16:06-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:16:06):**  ecosystem.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:16:07):**  And it looks like because of sort of the froth, because of the transaction, you know, velocity  
**[0:16:13-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:16:13):**  in the space all of a sudden that we may have to exit.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:16:15):**  And that's a positive thing for the LPs and is a fiduciary, but we don't just think about  
**[0:16:20-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:16:20):**  financial returns.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:16:21):**  Yeah, that's an interesting issue and a luxury problem obviously to have.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:16:27):**  And I think we're going to have exactly the same discussion with a few investors and a  
**[0:16:30-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:16:30):**  few funds over the last weeks.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:16:32):**  Like, yes, we need to innovate on the time horizon and maybe might be a holding company,  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:16:38):**  might be an evergreen fund, et cetera.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:16:40):**  Many investors might not be ready for that.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:16:42):**  I don't know what's your experience there.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:16:43):**  You might raise a lot less with a lot more trouble.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:16:46):**  And at the same time, which might be a good battle to have, like spend two, three years  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:16:50):**  on the road, teaching everybody about evergreen capital and raising 15 million or 10 million  
**[0:16:54-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:16:54):**  and put that to work or raise significantly more now and spend the next 10 years or next  
**[0:17:01-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:17:01):**  few years investing, which is what we need to kick start a lot of these companies and  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:17:04):**  then figure out after, okay, what does the second fund look like and how does that continuum  
**[0:17:09-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:17:09):**  will grow?  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:17:10):**  And it's a bit like planting a lot of trees in an agro grocery system and hoping that  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:17:13):**  somebody will figure out and like a harvesting machine along the way as they are growing.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:17:18):**  So it's a bit of a risky bet, but at the same time, I really understand the approach because  
**[0:17:22-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:17:22):**  you cannot innovate on too many things at the same time for, especially for hesitant  
**[0:17:27-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:17:27):**  investors to get on board.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:17:29):**  Well and I think you've heard my partner, Mark talk about, you know, the way that we  
**[0:17:33-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:17:33):**  would like to innovate in the structure again, to be founder friendly.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:17:39):**  I mean, we really want to be able to wrap the entrepreneurial verve and support that  
**[0:17:44-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:17:44):**  all the way through the continuum.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:17:46):**  And that doesn't just mean, you know, our investable piece at that time, it means supporting  
**[0:17:51-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:17:51):**  them with the ecosystem and all of our network.  
**[0:17:53-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:17:53):**  And so I think we will continue to, you know, we're building a set of thematic funds and,  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:18:01):**  you know, we see this as our life's work going forward, but we will, I think, begin to iterate  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:18:07):**  on the format and the structure to your point, as we get to a point where we have the architecture  
**[0:18:12-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:18:12):**  to fill out.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:18:13):**  I think first we need to get money in the space, into the ideas and grow these seeds  
**[0:18:18-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:18:18):**  into A's and B's and C's to where we have an ecosystem.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:18:21):**  And then we can get creative once we have the institutions involved in the space, we  
**[0:18:26-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:18:26):**  can start to think about what those structures look like.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:18:29):**  And to your point, because playing the advocate, the devil's advocate here, everybody says  
**[0:18:33-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:18:33):**  they're founder friendly.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:18:35):**  How does that show in this case with you and specifically, as you mentioned, the space  
**[0:18:39-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:18:39):**  is getting crowdier and hotter in certain places.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:18:42):**  And you might need to compete with other funds that are not specifically focused on Regen  
**[0:18:47-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:18:47):**  but are starting to get interested for instance.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:18:49):**  So how do you make sure you get a seat at the table, not only in the round, but then  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:18:53):**  probably one of the things you can bring is not only the money, but that founder friendliness,  
**[0:18:57-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:18:57):**  the ecosystem, et cetera, what is your edge there than more than just money, because it's  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:19:01):**  getting hotter in this space and it is getting hotter, which is great.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:19:05):**  But also challenging for groups like yourself.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:19:06):**  Well, and you know, I think we feel actually incredibly collaborative.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:19:10):**  I mean, coming from the asset management world, there's a lot of sharp elbows and this is  
**[0:19:14-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:19:14):**  really a sort of rising tide lifts all boats.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:19:17):**  So we love collaborating with all of the sort of luminaries that are out there.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:19:21):**  And the lowering tide shows that who's been swimming naked, right?  
**[0:19:24-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:19:24):**  That's the buffet quote.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:19:27):**  And to your point, I would say, you know, we think we do have some differentiated edge  
**[0:19:31-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:19:31):**  in sort of our deep regenerative knowledge.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:19:35):**  And we've been students of this movement for a very long time on the front end, and we've  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:19:39):**  been investing in and thinking about it.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:19:43):**  And so we have pretty deep networks.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:19:45):**  So one of the things that we bring is the ability to bring our network and we can articulate  
**[0:19:51-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:19:51):**  that in terms of customers.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:19:52):**  So you know, you've heard about one of our investments called Telesense.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:19:56):**  It's a hardware orb, predictive analytics for perishability, and it reduces waste about  
**[0:20:01-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:20:01):**  30% in barges and grain silos.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:20:05):**  It also reduces workers comp because there's an HSE component.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:20:08):**  You don't have humans having to take core samples, which they get hurt frequently.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:20:13):**  But when we went into that deal, we were able to bring their three top customers now into  
**[0:20:19-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:20:19):**  that equation and, you know, receive a step up in the next round.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:20:23):**  And so, you know, there's a very articulatable way of how we bring value from our network.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:20:28):**  Beyond the cash.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:20:30):**  Beyond the cash, I would say also we're all founders.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:20:32):**  So you know, Mark Lewis has founded and run.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:20:36):**  Pete has founded and run.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:20:37):**  I have founded and run and we've all exited.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:20:39):**  And so, you know, we've been operators and entrepreneurs as well as investors.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:20:43):**  And so I think we have a unique lens.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:20:46):**  I would really implore people to talk to our portfolio CEOs like a Megan Rowe at Whiteleaf  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:20:51):**  to say, this is what Trailhead has been able to do for us because I don't like patting  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:20:56):**  ourselves on the back, but I do think we have an arsenal of tools to really be supportive.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:21:00):**  And we try to be active in a really positive way.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:21:04):**  And sometimes we'll have some, an entrepreneur tell us, hang on, we're just not there yet.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:21:09):**  Right.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:21:10):**  As we try to push, push, push for growth and new ideas.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:21:13):**  And so we try to be really collaborative.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:21:15):**  And I have my CEOs that they have my cell phone number, they'll call me on a weekend  
**[0:21:19-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:21:19):**  and I'll take the call and, you know, we'll talk something out.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:21:22):**  And that's still possible, obviously, as you're relatively small in a good way.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:21:25):**  I mean, that might change.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:21:27):**  And if you're at 50 companies with all your cell phone number, it becomes a bit more tricky.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:21:31):**  But for the time being, that's a non-scalable thing to do, which makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:21:35):**  So what has happened since we talked with Mark in June, what has happened over the summer  
**[0:21:40-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:21:40):**  that Whiteleaf deal you just mentioned, Wishweed, by the way, also in interview just happened,  
**[0:21:44-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:21:44):**  I think at that time was just announced.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:21:46):**  So how has been the summer and what has kept you busy?  
**[0:21:49-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:21:49):**  We're now talking in October, by the way, just for people keeping track.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:21:52):**  It's been a great summer.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:21:53):**  It's been incredibly frenetic.  
**[0:21:54-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:21:54):**  Again, you know, it's been unique for us in the sense that we've made now seven investments.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:22:01):**  We have about five more we're close to that are in the sort of investment committee track.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:22:07):**  So I think we'll end the year somewhere around 12 to 15 investments, which is a really good  
**[0:22:12-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:22:12):**  clip.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:22:13):**  And what we set out to do, a deal, a partner per quarter was a pace we thought we could  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:22:19):**  maintain with the sort of rigor of our underwriting and due diligence that we want to have as  
**[0:22:23-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:22:23):**  fiduciaries.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:22:25):**  So we've made some incredible commitments.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:22:28):**  We're looking in new and exciting areas that really add on to the portfolio construction  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:22:35):**  and the thematic that we've talked about in and around soil and our sort of three verticals,  
**[0:22:40-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:22:40):**  which we can talk about a little bit.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:22:42):**  But certainly, you know, beyond organic CPG is continues to be in our wheelhouse.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:22:48):**  So Whiteleaf is a great example.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:22:50):**  CPG just for anybody.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:22:51):**  What does it stand for?  
**[0:22:53-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:22:53):**  Consumer packaged goods.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:22:54):**  Forgive me.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:22:55):**  And so we think of Whiteleaf as a, you know, it's a biodynamic demeter certified, you know,  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:23:01):**  Megan and team just won a next award at Expo East as they've launched some new skews in  
**[0:23:06-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:23:06):**  there.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:23:07):**  Those new skews are outside of just baby food.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:23:10):**  So it really is a true provisions brand.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:23:12):**  And that's really exciting because it really kicks into a deeper soil thesis, which I'd  
**[0:23:17-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:23:17):**  like to go back to.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:23:18):**  And it really talks about the heavy metal contaminants, the nano particulate plastic  
**[0:23:24-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:23:24):**  matter, obviously all of the agrochemical stuff.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:23:27):**  You know, it's not in Whiteleaf.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:23:28):**  It's in every other baby food because we in the U.S. don't test our food for heavy metals.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:23:35):**  So we'll get back to that.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:23:36):**  It's a big theme for us in soil and for education in the consumer packaged goods.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:23:41):**  So you'll see some beyond organic regenerative CPG in our future.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:23:46):**  We're excited about that.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:23:47):**  And do you see there the consumer demand being there?  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:23:51):**  That often talked about people are starting to choose different things in the supermarket.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:23:55):**  I had a discussion with Nestle over that, I think just before the summer, they started  
**[0:23:59-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:23:59):**  to be very interested in the space because they see people switch or at least they see  
**[0:24:03-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:24:03):**  that in there.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:24:04):**  They see people checking ingredients, etc.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:24:06):**  Do you see that as well?  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:24:07):**  Do you see this finally the consumer getting out of that few percent that really go to  
**[0:24:12-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:24:12):**  that organic shop and really read the labels?  
**[0:24:14-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:24:14):**  Like, does it get to that?  
**[0:24:15-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:24:15):**  I don't know, early adopters, maybe like the next phase, like this is the group that is  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:24:19):**  slightly bigger, but very fundamental for this movement.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:24:22):**  Exactly.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:24:23):**  And I was on this train so long before COVID and I knew that this was a growing segment.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:24:29):**  I was passionate about it.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:24:30):**  But to your point, early adopters.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:24:31):**  I think COVID really exposed a lot of what was going on in the food system and gave people  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:24:37):**  a chance to educate themselves a little bit more about that supply chain.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:24:42):**  So I really now think you're seeing the demand not only from subscription, online subscription  
**[0:24:49-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:24:49):**  for food, that category has gone through the roof.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:24:52):**  I look at then things like what Whole Foods is doing, you know, and I really championed  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:24:56):**  the way that they're thinking about regenerative shelf placement because they're taking real  
**[0:25:01-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:25:01):**  data, turn reports, you know, spends turn reports, and they're making planagrams in  
**[0:25:07-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:25:07):**  a regenerative sense and telling their suppliers.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:25:10):**  And we have a large LP that's a big supplier to Whole Foods that just showed us their supplier  
**[0:25:16-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:25:16):**  deck or presentation for 2022.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:25:19):**  And they're making room for up to 30 percent of their shelf space for regenerative products.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:25:24):**  Wow.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:25:25):**  Like certified or it's going to be them checking the outcomes?  
**[0:25:28-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:25:28):**  Like what do they mean by regenerative products?  
**[0:25:30-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:25:30):**  Oh, now this.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:25:33):**  So they would say justify a regenerative claim.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:25:36):**  OK.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:25:37):**  Is how they would talk about it.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:25:38):**  So we can go down the certification path, which I think, you know, with our partnership  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:25:42):**  with Rodale and the deep reverence with what the institute does, you know, we really like  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:25:47):**  the ROC.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:25:49):**  That's the regenerative organic certification that Dr. Bronner's and Patagonia and Rodale  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:25:54):**  have put together and where, you know, we found Whiteleaf.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:25:57):**  So again, one of our kind of proprietary deal origination sources is the Rodale Institute.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:26:04):**  And so, you know, I think that that certification is a very high bar.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:26:09):**  But I will tell you that I end on the path of supporting the Dan Kittredge of the world  
**[0:26:15-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:26:15):**  and trying to say, let's figure out an outcomes based result, because as much as I appreciate  
**[0:26:23-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:26:23):**  the methodologies and the certification that get me a demeter certification, it doesn't  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:26:29):**  necessarily one to one correlate to what is in this apple that I'm about to eat.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:26:35):**  And so we really would like to know from a phytonutrient active compound, what's actually  
**[0:26:41-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:26:41):**  in that apple.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:26:43):**  And you know, Dan and his team, Holly, and there's a whole host of people working towards  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:26:48):**  that transparency on the molecular nutrition side.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:26:52):**  And I think that's the panacea that we're all so excited about.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:26:55):**  But until then, I think we need to be better than organic, but organics a great start.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:27:01):**  And I think the regenerative organic certification is a good way there.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:27:04):**  So what are the deals?  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:27:05):**  I mean, you mentioned Whiteleaf, which we discussed previously as well, and I will link  
**[0:27:09-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:27:09):**  the interview we did with them below.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:27:12):**  What are these?  
**[0:27:13-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:27:13):**  Can you talk about, obviously, if there's something you can talk about that has happened  
**[0:27:15-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:27:15):**  over the summer, either specifically or very vaguely, something we didn't hear from Mark  
**[0:27:20-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:27:20):**  yet that you might be able to point us to what you're excited about?  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:27:23):**  I mean, you mentioned other regenerative or beyond organic CPG brands.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:27:27):**  So we can imagine there might be other things we can buy in a supermarket.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:27:30):**  Okay.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:27:31):**  I imagine you don't want to mention any names, but anything else you can mention in terms  
**[0:27:34-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:27:34):**  of deals you have done so far?  
**[0:27:36-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:27:36):**  Or should we check in like end of year for that or early next year?  
**[0:27:40-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:27:40):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:27:41):**  So I'll give you sort of the categories of which we've done because I think waste mitigation  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:27:47):**  is huge.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:27:48):**  Okay.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:27:49):**  So we have that as a theme and we're looking at a few things in that vertical.  
**[0:27:53-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:27:53):**  Like waste on the farm, waste between farm and consumer, waste in the kitchen, what waste?  
**[0:28:00-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:28:00):**  Really supply chain waste.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:28:02):**  So it's really, you know, that most of the waste, and you heard Mark talk about this  
**[0:28:05-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:28:05):**  a little bit in his podcast, is really in that supply chain.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:28:08):**  And so there are simple technical solutions to reduce that waste that we want to invest  
**[0:28:14-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:28:14):**  in.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:28:15):**  So that's a big category we're excited about.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:28:17):**  Organic waste or I mean like in the organic, because that's always then the question, okay,  
**[0:28:22-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:28:22):**  you're helping food waste be reduced fundamentally in a conventional extractive system, or are  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:28:28):**  you focusing then on the organic part of the system or even the regenerative, which is  
**[0:28:32-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:28:32):**  much smaller part, obviously of the value chain or anything food waste is a huge issue.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:28:37):**  Let's invest and let's get it fixed.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:28:39):**  I think you'll see the way we think about this is all these things is on a spectrum.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:28:43):**  And so, you know, whether it's black soldier fly and reducing CAFO waste, whether it is  
**[0:28:51-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:28:51):**  supply chain transparency and just reduction of time, which time kills food, you know,  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:28:58):**  these, all of these across these two on farm, as Mark would tell you about biomass and all  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:29:03):**  aspects I would say of waste, you know, we're thinking about how we can move the needle  
**[0:29:08-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:29:08):**  with our capital.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:29:09):**  So waste is definitely something we're going to hear announcement about and anything else.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:29:14):**  It is.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:29:15):**  And I would say a two other very exciting categories for me are obviously the biological,  
**[0:29:20-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:29:20):**  let's call them amendments.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:29:21):**  I think there is a host of really exciting things that we're looking at.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:29:25):**  And we've got two very exciting announcements that are coming up in that particular space.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:29:31):**  How do you screen them?  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:29:33):**  Because I find obviously you go way deeper than we do for inviting somebody on the podcast.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:29:37):**  I find it very difficult to separate the noise from the interesting space and the amendments  
**[0:29:43-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:29:43):**  or inputs because there's a lot happening for sure.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:29:47):**  A lot of interesting things.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:29:48):**  I just am not a soil biologist and not a farmer at any large scale, except for some plants  
**[0:29:52-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:29:52):**  here and there.  
**[0:29:53-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:29:53):**  Like how do you understand which ones are actually helping, let's say a transition towards  
**[0:30:01-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:30:01):**  a more regenerative system, except not just getting the farmer to replace one input for  
**[0:30:07-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:30:07):**  another one and getting them hooked for that basically forever, which is a more sustainable,  
**[0:30:10-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:30:10):**  better input, I believe all of that, but it doesn't get you off the drug afterwards in  
**[0:30:14-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:30:14):**  terms of any transition.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:30:16):**  Like how do you put them on a spectrum of, Ooh, this is super interesting from a regenerative  
**[0:30:20-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:30:20):**  perspective or this is just helping an extractive system to come just a bit cleaner?  
**[0:30:26-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:30:26):**  Great question.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:30:27):**  So we think about it in sort of a vector or directional sense.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:30:31):**  And so, you know, what we would tell you is that in the perfect poly culture, animal integrated  
**[0:30:38-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:30:38):**  biodiverse plots, the plants really take care of their own immunology.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:30:43):**  You really don't need all of the synthetic inputs and even the organic or biological  
**[0:30:48-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:30:48):**  inputs that we're talking about.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:30:50):**  If you have the perfect homeostasis with the water cycle, the carbon cycle, the diversity,  
**[0:30:56-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:30:56):**  the perennialization that we, that we talk about.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:30:58):**  So that's the aspirational end point.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:31:01):**  But I think to get there, we've got to prime the pump.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:31:04):**  And so coming from this large extractive chemical based agricultural system, you know, we believe  
**[0:31:12-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:31:12):**  that there are some off ramps and we think of these amendments as off ramps to get to  
**[0:31:19-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:31:19):**  the perfect spot.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:31:21):**  And that's when you get interested.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:31:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:31:23):**  And that's when we get interested.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:31:24):**  But really to answer your question, I mean, I'm not a biologist, I'm not a chemist.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:31:28):**  I'm a philosopher and a businessman.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:31:31):**  I'm an investor.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:31:32):**  And so, you know, what we did is partner with the most respected minds and the best advisory  
**[0:31:39-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:31:39):**  staff that we could put together that would help us de-risk the tech on a tech side.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:31:45):**  So you know, we've got guys like Seth Levine that can help us think through one of the  
**[0:31:49-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:31:49):**  best tech investors in the world.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:31:52):**  What a SAS roadmap needs to look like for a given technology.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:31:57):**  We then have, you know, the Rodale Institute with Jeff Moyer and his incredible staff of  
**[0:32:01-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:32:01):**  scientists, which we run all of our scientific ideas to ground with.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:32:07):**  We have Dr. Doug Cameron, who is the ex Cargill chief scientist who had a regen apostasy and  
**[0:32:14-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:32:14):**  who is an incredibly valuable team member.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:32:16):**  I can't say enough.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:32:17):**  Tell me more about that.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:32:19):**  What happened with that?  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:32:20):**  Cargill isn't known to be the most regenerative company in the planet.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:32:24):**  And wasn't certainly when he was there in the 90s.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:32:27):**  Right.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:32:28):**  And so he just as a thinker, as an outdoorsman, you know, he thought there was more and he  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:32:33):**  went to go seek out a more holistic idea of what food and ag can be.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:32:38):**  And left Cargill.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:32:39):**  And left Cargill and has done an amazing amount of things since.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:32:43):**  And really, we're honored to have him as our one of our scientific leads.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:32:46):**  And then we have the Mad Ag crew.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:32:48):**  So you know, Dr. Phil Taylor is an advisor.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:32:51):**  So everything we look at, whether it's dandelions for rubber or whether it's some kind of a  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:32:58):**  metabologenomic input that we're going to put in the farm, we run it through, you know,  
**[0:33:03-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:33:03):**  our scientific advisory so that we can feel good about the probability of that science.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:33:09):**  And so that's the second pillar, let's say the second stream of few potential announcements,  
**[0:33:14-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:33:14):**  let's say by the end of this year.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:33:16):**  And then you mentioned the third.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:33:18):**  What's the third?  
**[0:33:19-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:33:19):**  And that's really the metabologenomics piece.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:33:21):**  So what is that in plain English?  
**[0:33:24-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:33:24):**  So for me, this is one of the most exciting things within the food and ag system, mainly  
**[0:33:30-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:33:30):**  because we know so little.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:33:34):**  You know, I was thinking about your podcast with Dan Barber and we just know so little  
**[0:33:38-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:33:38):**  about the food.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:33:40):**  You know, we know 80% of the compounds in the given food are unknown to us.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:33:46):**  Right.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:33:47):**  And so as we start thinking about aeroponics and hydroponics and cell-based things, you  
**[0:33:53-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:33:53):**  know, I think the answer to all of that is, is it good or is it bad?  
**[0:33:57-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:33:57):**  I don't have an ethical position on any of it.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:34:00):**  What I think is the outcome is, is it comparable from a nutrient density standpoint for people?  
**[0:34:07-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:34:07):**  And we don't know that, but we're going to know that in the next, you know, five to seven  
**[0:34:11-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:34:11):**  years, you know, with the likes of the bright seeds of the world and all of this investigation,  
**[0:34:16-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:34:16):**  you know, to the molecular level, obviously what the Bio Nutrient Institute and the in  
**[0:34:21-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:34:21):**  Kittredge are doing.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:34:23):**  So that next frontier for us is incredibly exciting.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:34:27):**  And basically, metabologenomics are crop protection derived from signaling molecules in the soil  
**[0:34:36-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:34:36):**  biome.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:34:37):**  And there is a vast amount of work that can be done there of molecules, of molecules and  
**[0:34:43-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:34:43):**  of compounds of which we just need massive amounts of discovery.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:34:48):**  And so we really were partnered with some academic institutions.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:34:51):**  So what would it do?  
**[0:34:52-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:34:52):**  Would that be how to trigger some of these to repel certain pests or weeds or what would  
**[0:35:00-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:35:00):**  it do, let's say for a farmer that isn't at that perfect state of a polyculture with integrated  
**[0:35:05-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:35:05):**  animals, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:35:06):**  Like I'm a farmer and I want to go off the off-ramp, but, and this is a potential exit.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:35:10):**  What would that look like for me?  
**[0:35:12-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:35:12):**  Would it be something I spray, something I inject, something I give to the animals that  
**[0:35:17-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:35:17):**  I might have running on my cover crops or something?  
**[0:35:19-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:35:19):**  What would it actionable look like as a farmer for the soil?  
**[0:35:23-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:35:23):**  Great point.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:35:24):**  So actionably for the farmer, it will be, you know, a cost reduction of the input with  
**[0:35:30-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:35:30):**  the same outcomes of orders of magnitude, 5x cost reductions.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:35:36):**  And then the application can be seed inoculants.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:35:40):**  It can be drip irrigated.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:35:41):**  It can be sprayed, broadly sprayed.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:35:44):**  So there's a multitude of ways of getting it to the crops and then into the animals,  
**[0:35:49-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:35:49):**  into their water supply or into the, on the grasses for the rotational grazing set.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:35:54):**  So it's very cost effective and using basically the same hardware infrastructure that you're  
**[0:35:59-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:35:59):**  using now.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:36:00):**  So it's very compatible for the steward.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:36:03):**  And how is it then fundamentally different from let's say the soil amendment space you  
**[0:36:06-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:36:06):**  mentioned before, why do you put it in a separate category?  
**[0:36:10-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:36:10):**  Is it like, because the process is so fundamentally different, what it does, how it attacks the  
**[0:36:14-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:36:14):**  problem of I have pests and I have weeds or what does it, why does it deserve a separate  
**[0:36:19-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:36:19):**  category for you?  
**[0:36:20-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:36:20):**  Because this is an entirely new scientific endeavor into small molecules, which are very  
**[0:36:26-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:36:26):**  different than their large molecule brethren.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:36:29):**  And it's a space of which we have very, very little understanding.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:36:33):**  And so I think, you know, we know a lot about the chemical lens of what the biological input  
**[0:36:40-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:36:40):**  should look like.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:36:41):**  We know a little bit about the biological lens of what those can look like.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:36:46):**  And you know, I think about John Kemp and folks like that who I think are doing such  
**[0:36:50-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:36:50):**  great work on, you know, the biological side, but there's a whole new frontier that these  
**[0:36:56-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:36:56):**  scientists and these institutes are learning, you know, can really help with a variety of  
**[0:37:03-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:37:03):**  self-regulation that are all naturally occurring.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:37:06):**  So it's a really exciting field.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:37:08):**  And is there a danger there because we understand so little about the molecules in general and  
**[0:37:15-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:37:15):**  the molecules in the soil in particular, is there a danger we start playing with fire?  
**[0:37:19-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:37:19):**  Like what's the, or it simply doesn't, maybe the danger is it doesn't work, which is okay.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:37:24):**  But is there a danger of what's the potential for side effects, weird waking up a super  
**[0:37:29-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:37:29):**  week that was there sleeping and we didn't know it was there and like, what's the tricky  
**[0:37:34-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:37:34):**  part here?  
**[0:37:35-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:37:35):**  Yeah, the tricky part is, and you nailed it.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:37:37):**  I think about it in this old Greek adage from my philosophy, koros, hubris, ate.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:37:43):**  Okay.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:37:44):**  You have a great victory.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:37:46):**  From that comes incredible hubris to which comes ultimate demise.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:37:53):**  And so, you know, I think about the power of what we're playing with and we talk about  
**[0:37:57-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:37:57):**  this a lot.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:37:58):**  And you know, we want to be supporting nature.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:38:02):**  We want to be listening and supporting the natural processes, not trying to over engineer,  
**[0:38:07-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:38:07):**  right?  
**[0:38:08-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:38:08):**  We've seen what that hubris has done.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:38:11):**  You know, if you look at what we created with the fertilizer early on, we had a great victory,  
**[0:38:16-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:38:16):**  but then we believe that we could do better.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:38:19):**  And we're really students of nature.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:38:20):**  The biomimicry is where we reside and that's our sort of true North.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:38:25):**  And so as we think about any of these things, we have a very nuanced take to really support  
**[0:38:30-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:38:30):**  the natural processes, not to override or over engineer because we're thinking in short  
**[0:38:36-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:38:36):**  term cycles and nature's thinking in millennia.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:38:38):**  Yeah, I'm very curious about it.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:38:40):**  I'm thinking that further when there are concrete examples to discuss.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:38:43):**  So let's spark that for now.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:38:45):**  I'm excited about that.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:38:46):**  Let's switch gears a bit with, you mentioned before we have to prime the pump.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:38:50):**  Like we're moving back to the financial side of things.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:38:53):**  Let's say the pump has been primed.  
**[0:38:54-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:38:54):**  So you are actually in charge of a $1 billion investment fund or 10 billion or like a large,  
**[0:39:00-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:39:00):**  like a significant large amount.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:39:02):**  I asked this question because I'm curious about what people would focus on, not because  
**[0:39:05-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:39:05):**  I want to know the exact breakdown of, I would put 150 to 50 into this.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:39:10):**  I'm curious, what would you focus on if you had basically wouldn't say unlimited, but  
**[0:39:15-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:39:15):**  almost unlimited resources in terms of financial to invest, obviously to invest the grand part  
**[0:39:20-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:39:20):**  of things, you can do it with the returns if you want to, but I'm interested as an investor  
**[0:39:24-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:39:24):**  what would you focus on if you had a considerable investment fund and the pump has been primed  
**[0:39:29-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:39:29):**  or maybe there's not a lot of deal flow could also be like, I would put it in priming the  
**[0:39:33-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:39:33):**  pump further because the money is not the issue, but the deal flow is what would be  
**[0:39:36-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:39:36):**  your take on that?  
**[0:39:38-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:39:38):**  And I think I would say to you, you know, first we believe that we're going to build,  
**[0:39:42-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:39:42):**  you know, a series of funds and hopefully be deploying billions of dollars into this  
**[0:39:47-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:39:47):**  space, you know, across multiple asset classes, infrastructure, ag tech, all the things that  
**[0:39:54-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:39:54):**  we care deeply about, farmland, agroforestry.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:39:58):**  But I think if you asked me what I would do with a billion dollars, because, you know,  
**[0:40:03-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:40:03):**  it's a huge amount of money, don't get me wrong, but when you think about the investing  
**[0:40:07-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:40:07):**  landscape and I think about, you know, aquaculture, which I don't think you can leave out of the  
**[0:40:13-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:40:13):**  regenerative equation because the interconnectivity of our planet is such that, you know, it's  
**[0:40:18-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:40:18):**  deeply involved.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:40:19):**  oceans and forests are connected.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:40:22):**  oceans and forests are connected.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:40:24):**  That's a hundred trillion dollar opportunity.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:40:26):**  So when you ask me about a billion dollars, you know, it begins to pale in comparison.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:40:30):**  So my answer, I guess first would be, I would do exactly what we're doing, you know, because  
**[0:40:34-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:40:34):**  we came to this thesis and understanding because we have to build the first set of companies,  
**[0:40:41-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:40:41):**  you know, to build this asset class.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:40:43):**  It's still nascent and has, you know, 10 years of growth to get to its sort of complimentary  
**[0:40:50-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:40:50):**  asset classes.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:40:51):**  Do you see it as a separate asset class or, or a lens that you can like the regeneration  
**[0:40:57-0:41:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:40:57):**  lens or something you can put over potentially all asset classes, looking at infrastructure,  
**[0:41:01-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:41:01):**  looking at farmland, looking at your mobility, potentially looking at housing, looking at  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:41:06):**  education or would it be all bundled into, okay, this is the regenerative asset class.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:41:11):**  What do you see there?  
**[0:41:13-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:41:13):**  I think you articulated it well, Coon.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:41:14):**  I think it's more of, right.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:41:16):**  It's a well articulated thesis that moves as an umbrella across all asset classes.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:41:22):**  Yeah, because now you're applying it to VC, but in X years, when this fund is invested,  
**[0:41:27-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:41:27):**  you'll be applying it hopefully to XYZ.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:41:29):**  And then you'll be applying it to with obviously different parameters, parameters, because  
**[0:41:35-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:41:35):**  it's different than you invest in farmland, but probably different amounts as well.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:41:38):**  So it's, I got triggered because it's a bit the same saying impact investing is an asset  
**[0:41:43-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:41:43):**  class.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:41:44):**  So you're applying a lens to all your investments and potentially your philanthropy and also  
**[0:41:47-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:41:47):**  your life.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:41:48):**  What, how can I maximize, minimize negative impact and maximize, how can I net positive  
**[0:41:53-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:41:53):**  as much as possible?  
**[0:41:55-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:41:55):**  And that's the trigger part because it, when the impact investing space was born, it was  
**[0:41:58-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:41:58):**  an asset class or it was mentioned like these people in the corner, let's keep them there.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:42:02):**  Let's grow that a bit.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:42:03):**  And then that's okay.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:42:04):**  No, it needs to be applied to everything also to education.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:42:06):**  Well and for me, it's like ESG and the nomenclature in investing.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:42:10):**  I mean, you know, to choose ESG feels a little bit contrived.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:42:14):**  I mean, everything should be looked at through an environmental social lens in my opinion.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:42:20):**  And so, and it is looked at, it's just very negative in most cases, like everything is  
**[0:42:24-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:42:24):**  impact investing is just very often, very negative.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:42:26):**  Like the impact is negative or if you like it or not, it's just, you cannot really escape  
**[0:42:31-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:42:31):**  that.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:42:32):**  Like everything is on a regenerative spectrum, probably on the darker side, the degenerative  
**[0:42:36-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:42:36):**  side, but it is on the spectrum.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:42:38):**  Any farm is.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:42:39):**  Well, and that's why we're working with, you know, the Iroquois valleys of the world, because  
**[0:42:43-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:42:43):**  I think that there's a lot of complementarity with our fund one portfolio, you know, what  
**[0:42:49-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:42:49):**  they, how they think about stewarding the land, but don't really have all of the sort  
**[0:42:52-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:42:52):**  of sub components dialed in.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:42:54):**  And how are you working with them?  
**[0:42:56-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:42:56):**  How does that look like in practice?  
**[0:42:58-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:42:58):**  Well, so we're in talks right now, but we're, you know, really wanting to put vents collars  
**[0:43:03-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:43:03):**  on, as you can imagine, a lot of the Iroquois valley lands because of so many reasons, as  
**[0:43:08-0:43:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:43:08):**  you well know, because it makes sense because it makes sense.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:43:11):**  And because we then think there's an income stream associated with that from the carbon  
**[0:43:15-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:43:15):**  markets, which then makes financial sense on top of the environmental sense.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:43:20):**  Of course, there's your portfolio companies, especially the more ag tech focused ones need  
**[0:43:26-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:43:26):**  a lot of lead, a lot of farmers to, to work with.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:43:28):**  And if you are working with a lot of farmers that are on a, that have taken the off ramp  
**[0:43:32-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:43:32):**  already and are in an interesting transition becomes, it becomes very interesting.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:43:36):**  When I think about, you know, how good, which obviously we're huge proponents of how good  
**[0:43:42-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:43:42):**  and how good is able to use those data points, new acreage or hectares with rotational grazing,  
**[0:43:50-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:43:50):**  you know, to put into their lattice matrix so they can understand a larger idea of regenerative  
**[0:43:56-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:43:56):**  sourcing to all of their database and clients.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:44:00):**  So it makes a lot of sense to start a farmland fund at some point.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:44:03):**  And they're very curious how you would structure that.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:44:06):**  Two, so with the one billion, you would do pretty much the same as you've been doing,  
**[0:44:11-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:44:11):**  but let's take it away and give you one wish like one with you have a magic wand and you  
**[0:44:17-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:44:17):**  can change one thing in the food and ag sector.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:44:19):**  What would that be?  
**[0:44:20-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:44:20):**  Could be anything from transparency to soil probes everywhere to data being accessible  
**[0:44:26-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:44:26):**  to all farm land being managed in the commons, like anything you can imagine.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:44:31):**  What would that one wish be?  
**[0:44:32-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:44:32):**  Sort of.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:44:33):**  So three things immediately popped in my mind.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:44:35):**  One is it's not just about carbon, it's about water.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:44:40):**  Okay.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:44:41):**  Coming back to what we started.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:44:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:44:43):**  Water, water, water.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:44:44):**  Water is the key fundament for all of this without it.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:44:47):**  None of it happens.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:44:48):**  And so, you know, we focus on carbon a lot, our water resources through the acid rain,  
**[0:44:54-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:44:54):**  through the pH increase in our streams, through what we're doing to the oceans.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:44:59):**  It's critical, but it's kind of, you know, off in a corner.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:45:03):**  So I want to like wake up.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:45:05):**  Okay.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:45:06):**  The world about that.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:45:07):**  I think, you know, I don't know if you've read the Dan or Paul Greenberg book, the Omega  
**[0:45:11-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:45:11):**  Principle.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:45:12):**  I think it's a great one to think about that.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:45:15):**  And then Patagonia has a documentary out, Artificial, which is a good one to watch also.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:45:21):**  I think my second one, and we talked about it a little bit, is provenance is the transparency  
**[0:45:28-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:45:28):**  in our food system.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:45:30):**  And that's understanding, unfortunately, the plastic particulate matter, the heavy metals,  
**[0:45:36-0:45:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:45:36):**  it's everything.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:45:37):**  And it's then the good stuff, the active compounds, the phytonutrients, the minerals, the good  
**[0:45:42-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:45:42):**  stuff.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:45:43):**  We just know so little.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:45:44):**  And so I'm really excited about the epiphanies that are happening in the food space, which  
**[0:45:48-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:45:48):**  I think are really going to validate premium pricing, a variety of things that really make  
**[0:45:54-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:45:54):**  this flywheel work.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:45:55):**  And then the third, and then I'm going to make you choose because I said one.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:45:58):**  And then the third is, we've talked about it a little bit, is the long duration patient  
**[0:46:05-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:46:05):**  thinking.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:46:06):**  So it's the myth of liquidity.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:46:08):**  What is the myth of liquidity?  
**[0:46:09-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:46:09):**  There's sort of a historical precedent in financial management that is what I would  
**[0:46:15-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:46:15):**  say is over conservative to the liquidity side of the scale.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:46:19):**  I always want to get out, be able to get out.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:46:22):**  Being able to get out quickly or have it available at any time, which is really a disservice  
**[0:46:27-0:46:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:46:27):**  to the investor over a long duration because patient capital, if you ask Jeremy Grantham,  
**[0:46:32-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:46:32):**  patient capital and venture capital is the greatest returning asset class of all times.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:46:37):**  And so I really think people can do better by thinking about really what their real liquidity  
**[0:46:44-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:46:44):**  needs are.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:46:45):**  It's a real analytic process to get there, but then being able to go long with the rest  
**[0:46:49-0:46:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:46:49):**  of those assets.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:46:50):**  That's a big piece of it.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:46:51):**  The other side of that coin is every investment you make and every dollar you spend, there's  
**[0:46:56-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:46:56):**  an ethic attached to that.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:46:59):**  How conscientious are we every time we're spending the dollar, whether it's on the food  
**[0:47:03-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:47:03):**  at a restaurant, on a piece of clothing, how much do you think about the entire supply  
**[0:47:08-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:47:08):**  line, right?  
**[0:47:09-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:47:09):**  The dignity of the wages of the people in the supply line, the diversity and inclusion  
**[0:47:14-0:47:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:47:14):**  that we don't think about this sort of conscious capitalism as much as we should.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:47:20):**  And I think it's really important for people to understand where they put their dollars.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:47:23):**  And now you have to choose one thing.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:47:25):**  What would be the key?  
**[0:47:26-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:47:26):**  I'm thinking it's got to be water, but tell me, what would you choose?  
**[0:47:29-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:47:29):**  I think it's, you know, I said it's the alpha and the omega, but I really think for me,  
**[0:47:34-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:47:34):**  for what we're doing in regenerative, for the expeditious need to get the soils, to  
**[0:47:41-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:47:41):**  get the methodologies on a grand scale, I think solving the nutrient transparency and  
**[0:47:47-0:47:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:47:47):**  understanding that differentiation in our food supply is imperative.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:47:51):**  Okay.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:47:52):**  So you go for understand.  
**[0:47:54-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:47:54):**  This is a question that definitely inspired by John Kempf.  
**[0:47:57-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:47:57):**  What do you believe to be true?  
**[0:47:58-0:48:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:47:58):**  We heard a few things, but where are you contrarian?  
**[0:48:00-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:48:00):**  Like, what do you believe to be true about the region, egg space or region egg and food  
**[0:48:04-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:48:04):**  space, even the regeneration space, if you want to make it a bit wider that others don't  
**[0:48:09-0:48:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:48:09):**  like, where do you, when you were having a drink after the Oakland conference a few weeks  
**[0:48:15-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:48:15):**  ago and you were discussing something and suddenly somebody said, but you really believe  
**[0:48:18-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:48:18):**  like that, where are you contrarian in your beliefs within this movement that often very  
**[0:48:23-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:48:23):**  things very similar, or at least it seems to be on the outset, which is a bit disturbing  
**[0:48:26-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:48:26):**  sometimes.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:48:27):**  Well, I'm going to go back to the water thing because everybody thinks terrestrially in  
**[0:48:33-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:48:33):**  regards to regenerative food and ag.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:48:36):**  Right.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:48:37):**  And so all when I hear and what I understand is going on is a real proxy for what we've  
**[0:48:44-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:48:44):**  done on the land.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:48:45):**  Right.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:48:46):**  So, you know, we talk about proteins a lot and think about them a lot and invest in them  
**[0:48:51-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:48:51):**  a lot.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:48:52):**  We have another conversation about that at some point, but it's very important that along  
**[0:48:58-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:48:58):**  that spectrum, we consider fish, which is the most efficient protein in the entire channel.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:49:05):**  And as we think about aspirationally, Coon, what, how do you acquire your beef?  
**[0:49:09-0:49:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:49:09):**  If you're a meat eater, you know, we would say, ideally you're bow hunting your own pronghorn.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:49:14):**  Okay.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:49:15):**  But, but that's sort of anachronistic and it's not really realistic anymore.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:49:19):**  And okay.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:49:20):**  So we're in the down line, you know, what's better and we end all the way over here at  
**[0:49:22-0:49:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:49:22):**  the worst sort of animal husbandry, CAFO operations.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:49:26):**  And there's a lot in between the same exact thing is happening now to our oceans.  
**[0:49:32-0:49:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:49:32):**  You know, my kids, kids aren't going to be able to go line, catch wild salmon in Bristol  
**[0:49:38-0:49:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:49:38):**  Bay.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:49:39):**  It's not going to be available anymore.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:49:40):**  So we're moving all of our aquaculture to land and we're creating fish CAFOs, you know,  
**[0:49:47-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:49:47):**  CAFOs, it's the exact same thing that we did on the land.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:49:50):**  And so, you know, I think what people aren't thinking about or where I'm a little bit contrarian  
**[0:49:54-0:49:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:49:54):**  is we have to focus on this too.  
**[0:49:56-0:50:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:49:56):**  And I think there's a time right now where there's tons of capital being spent on aquaculture  
**[0:50:01-0:50:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:50:01):**  facilities, which are again, monoculture over stocked facilities where sometimes they're  
**[0:50:09-0:50:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:50:09):**  even creating genetics so that you have, you know, a color, a size, just like we did in  
**[0:50:14-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:50:14):**  chicken and beef.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:50:15):**  So I really think there's an interesting time right now for the regenerative community to  
**[0:50:18-0:50:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:50:18):**  focus on how can we move the needle away from sort of those CAFOs for fishing and think  
**[0:50:24-0:50:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:50:24):**  about rewilding and hybridizing the estuaries where we have the ability to both assist nature,  
**[0:50:33-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:50:33):**  but not over engineer and then rebuild what, you know, she had originally made as our fisheries  
**[0:50:39-0:50:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:50:39):**  of the world.  
**[0:50:40-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:50:40):**  I think that's my position.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:50:41):**  Yeah, we're small teaser, nothing is finalized yet, but we're thinking about a series on  
**[0:50:47-0:50:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:50:47):**  region aquaculture as it's been.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:50:50):**  I think we talked about it two or three times and that's it, which is a shame for 70% of  
**[0:50:54-0:50:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:50:54):**  the earth surface actually should be called water surface and our history in sustainable  
**[0:50:59-0:51:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:50:59):**  aquaculture.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:51:00):**  And I'm very passionate to come back to the immense opportunities there and not the complete  
**[0:51:04-0:51:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:51:04):**  lack, but the lack of the region space to look at it, but also the rest of the food  
**[0:51:08-0:51:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:51:08):**  and egg space.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:51:09):**  So we're sort of this forgotten gigantic corner, which is most of the room actually, but we're  
**[0:51:13-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:51:13):**  sort of not looking at it because we're so focused in words on the land piece at the  
**[0:51:17-0:51:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:51:17):**  moment, which don't get me wrong, needs a lot of work.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:51:20):**  Needs a lot of work, but just getting to the final point, just like we grow all this corn  
**[0:51:24-0:51:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:51:24):**  and we zap all these resources of our terrestrial, you know, for ethanol, for high fructose corn  
**[0:51:29-0:51:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:51:29):**  syrup and for animal food, you know, we're basically mining the oceans for the same thing.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:51:34):**  We're mining all of the oceans for fish meal.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:51:37):**  Fish meal, fish oil, and then yeah, it's, and the potential there is enormous because  
**[0:51:43-0:51:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:51:43):**  of size, but it's also enormous because of the regeneration capacity.  
**[0:51:47-0:51:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:51:47):**  If you look at some fisheries that were closed off or even hopefully with some transition  
**[0:51:52-0:51:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:51:52):**  finance for the fishermen and women, but firstly, mostly men, the rebound of these systems has  
**[0:51:58-0:52:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:51:58):**  been very well documented and is astonishing compared to land banks.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:52:02):**  I mean, you have to go to the tropics to see that kind of growth that fast, that kind of  
**[0:52:07-0:52:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:52:07):**  life coming back if you just let it and assisted and manage that transition.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:52:11):**  So there's a space there that is pretty untapped and we're looking forward to getting deeper  
**[0:52:16-0:52:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:52:16):**  into that.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:52:17):**  So thank you for that nod, nudge in that direction.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:52:20):**  And to ask a final question, what would you, without advising, but would you investors  
**[0:52:25-0:52:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:52:25):**  that are listening to this, it might be a room full of investors, smart impact investors,  
**[0:52:30-0:52:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:52:30):**  obviously all looking for the deepest net positive.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:52:32):**  Would you push them toward or nudge them towards aquaculture?  
**[0:52:36-0:52:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:52:36):**  Would you nudge them towards other forgotten or not sometimes overlooked sectors?  
**[0:52:40-0:52:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:52:40):**  What would you tell them if they want to get active?  
**[0:52:44-0:52:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:52:44):**  Should they buy a farm?  
**[0:52:45-0:52:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:52:45):**  Should they get at their hands dirty?  
**[0:52:46-0:52:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:52:46):**  Should they buy a supermarket like you did?  
**[0:52:48-0:52:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:52:48):**  What's the best off-ramp from the extractive investment world into the regenerative one?  
**[0:52:52-0:53:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:52:52):**  Look, I think anybody who will be a land steward and take it upon themselves to rehabilitate  
**[0:53:00-0:53:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:53:00):**  or sustain a piece of land in the right way.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:53:03):**  I think that personally and societally is a great thing.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:53:07):**  I would like less corporate ownership of the land and more individualized, democratized  
**[0:53:12-0:53:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:53:12):**  land holdings.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:53:13):**  I think that benefits.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:53:14):**  I'm already curious how you're going to set up a farm land fund, but we keep that for  
**[0:53:18-0:53:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:53:18):**  an excellent.  
**[0:53:19-0:53:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:53:19):**  So, yes, but I would say then from an investing standpoint, I really think, and we talked  
**[0:53:24-0:53:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:53:24):**  to a lot of institutions like this, I think indexing across region venture with a fund  
**[0:53:30-0:53:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:53:30):**  like Trailhead, there's others out there that I respect deeply.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:53:34):**  I think that's the way that you get exposure to a broad base of these assets and you de-risk  
**[0:53:41-0:53:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:53:41):**  them by that diversity, quantity and portfolio construction.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:53:47):**  I think if you're a direct investor, I would say make sure that you're taking all of your  
**[0:53:53-0:53:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:53:53):**  philanthropic dollars.  
**[0:53:55-0:53:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:53:55):**  Maybe it's your Roth, maybe it's your IRA, maybe it's your DAF, and making sure those  
**[0:53:59-0:54:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:53:59):**  are directed.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:54:00):**  Which are all very much US terms just for the rest of the world.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:54:04):**  US financial terms, yes.  
**[0:54:05-0:54:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:54:05):**  If you don't know what they mean, you're probably not in the US.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:54:08):**  But make sure it goes back to my conscious spending and investment.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:54:13):**  Think about it.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:54:14):**  The biggest thing I would implore investors to do is be more conscious about the power  
**[0:54:19-0:54:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:54:19):**  of their investment and where they're putting those dollars.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:54:22):**  It really is the catalyst for change.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:54:24):**  And I always say final question and then it never happens, to round off this conversation  
**[0:54:29-0:54:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:54:29):**  in terms of Trailhead, you're hoping to finalise a number of investments over the next weeks.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:54:34):**  In terms of fundraising, what can you share there?  
**[0:54:36-0:54:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:54:36):**  We're now talking the middle of October.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:54:38):**  Obviously this is going on full speed at the moment.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:54:41):**  What's your target and when more or less in terms of closing the fund and investing that  
**[0:54:46-0:54:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:54:46):**  amount or will it be a slightly longer ongoing process?  
**[0:54:50-0:54:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:54:50):**  What's the current on that?  
**[0:54:51-0:54:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:54:51):**  Yeah, thanks for asking.  
**[0:54:52-0:54:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:54:52):**  So I think we'll have 12 to 15 investments by the end of the year.  
**[0:54:56-0:54:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:54:56):**  Final close for the fund will be at year end.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:54:59):**  And we're really excited about the LPs that have been supporting us, who have also really  
**[0:55:04-0:55:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:55:04):**  said that they're going to be in our next fund.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:55:06):**  And so we think we've got our fund one set that will then be sort of our fund two anchors.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:55:13):**  And we're just really grateful for the support of our LP base and their open minded mission  
**[0:55:17-0:55:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:55:17):**  thinking.  
**[0:55:18-0:55:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:55:18):**  And so we are closing in on our final close for the fund.  
**[0:55:22-0:55:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:55:22):**  And so we would welcome conversations of interested parties, but look forward to really moving  
**[0:55:28-0:55:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:55:28):**  on.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:55:29):**  Which will be around what kind of number?  
**[0:55:30-0:55:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:55:30):**  So 50 million, sorry, 5050.  
**[0:55:33-0:55:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:55:33):**  50 is the closing target for the end.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:55:36):**  And we're really probably irrespective of hitting that exact number.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:55:40):**  Going to close the fund at year end so we can continue to deploy another 12 to 15 in  
**[0:55:45-0:55:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:55:45):**  2022.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:55:46):**  Okay.  
**[0:55:47-0:55:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:55:47):**  Which will be the majority of the portfolio.  
**[0:55:49-0:55:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:55:49):**  Okay, super.  
**[0:55:50-0:55:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:55:50):**  So looking forward to checking on that and see how it goes and good luck because it can  
**[0:55:54-0:55:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:55:54):**  be extremely stressful months I've seen from the inside.  
**[0:55:57-0:56:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:55:57):**  And I can imagine at this period, both on the fundraising and the investing side to  
**[0:56:01-0:56:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:56:01):**  get this over the line by year end, which is always a crazy period.  
**[0:56:06-0:56:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:56:06):**  So I wish you a lot of luck with that.

**[0:58:36-0:58:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:58:36):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:58:41-0:58:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:58:41):**  different means.

**[0:59:00-0:59:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:59:00):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:59:05-0:59:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:59:05):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:59:11-0:59:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:59:11):**  invest in and what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could

**[0:59:31-0:59:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:59:31):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:59:34-0:59:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:59:34):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:59:36):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:59:39-0:59:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tripp-wall#t=0:59:39):**  It's also not investment advice.

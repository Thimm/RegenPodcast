**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:00:14):**  Welcome to Soil Builders, a series where we follow who is building soils at scale.

**[0:00:22-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:00:22):**  Why this show Soil Builders?  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:00:23):**  I believe that most change in regenerative agriculture and food will come from and is  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:00:27):**  coming from entrepreneurs building ways to regenerate soil at scale.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:00:32):**  I call these Soil Builders.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:00:34):**  Soil Builders are entrepreneurial farmers, agtech companies, investment funds, food startups,  
**[0:00:38-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:00:38):**  new seed cooperatives, teams within food companies, robot startups, investment vehicles, etc.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:00:45):**  All regenerating soil beyond their own farm gate and with more than their own money.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:00:49):**  This series allows the community of the podcast, which is you, full of funders, investors and  
**[0:00:54-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:00:54):**  fellow soil builders to follow their progress.  
**[0:00:57-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:00:57):**  Their challenges and their breakthroughs.

**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:01:04):**  Welcome to Soil Builders, a series where we follow who is building soils at scale.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:01:08):**  Today we're checking in with an investor in the new African farmers bond Emiliano has  
**[0:01:12-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:01:12):**  raised in Ghana, which we featured a few months ago.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:01:15):**  And we go deep into the role of small robots in regenerative agriculture and why not all  
**[0:01:19-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:01:19):**  weeds are created equal.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:01:21):**  But first impact investor Brent Kessel on why he invested in the new African farmers bond.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:01:27):**  Hi Brent, thank you so much for agreeing on sharing your story.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:01:31):**  Could you please briefly introduce yourself and what brought you to impact investing?  
**[0:01:37-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:01:37):**  My name is Brent Kessel.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:01:38):**  I'm the CEO and co-founder of Abacus Wealth Partners, which is an impact investment advisory  
**[0:01:45-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:01:45):**  and financial planning firm in the US.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:01:48):**  We have clients all over the country and a few in Europe.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:01:52):**  What brought me to impact investing is, I'd say originally growing up in apartheid South  
**[0:01:56-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:01:56):**  Africa and seeing the inequity of that systemic racism.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:02:03):**  And then, you know, more recently, well, when I was an adult after graduating from college,  
**[0:02:10-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:02:10):**  I really wanted to combine heart and purpose and meaning with finance and impact investing  
**[0:02:18-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:02:18):**  as a term anyway didn't exist back then.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:02:20):**  But as I initially started with negative screening in public securities and then moved on to  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:02:27):**  microfinance investing and other kinds of impact investing starting in the 90s, really,  
**[0:02:32-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:02:32):**  I realized I could have both.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:02:34):**  I could help myself and help clients have meaning and purpose and earn appropriate financial  
**[0:02:39-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:02:39):**  returns oftentimes better than the alternatives.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:02:42):**  How did you meet Emiliano and how did you get in touch with work?  
**[0:02:46-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:02:46):**  I met Emiliano originally, oh boy, I want to say it was like 2015, maybe 14, somewhere  
**[0:02:54-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:02:54):**  back then.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:02:55):**  We were introduced by a mutual friend, Cristiano Cardenare, who I had met in my Tibetan Buddhist  
**[0:03:03-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:03:03):**  meditation travels.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:03:05):**  I actually met him in Kathmandu, Nepal, where we were both on a pilgrimage together.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:03:09):**  And I loved Cristiano, my family loved Cristiano and we had actually traveled the world, my  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:03:14):**  family, in 2013 and stayed with Cristiano in Argentina.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:03:19):**  Anyway, he's an impact investor and a philanthropist and we just really hit it off on lots of levels.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:03:25):**  And so when Emiliano was making a trip through the States a year or two later, he said, you  
**[0:03:29-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:03:29):**  guys have to sit down with each other.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:03:30):**  And we did and really did connect very well.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:03:34):**  What attracted you as an investor and made you decide to invest?  
**[0:03:38-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:03:38):**  I really believed and still believe in Emiliano and Jorge's passion and vision and sincerity  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:03:47):**  for helping the West African subsistence level farmers help themselves.  
**[0:03:53-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:03:53):**  What originally attracted me to Impact Investing 20 years ago and the fact that they were there  
**[0:04:00-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:04:00):**  so soon after the civil war that had devastated Sierra Leone and had just started to build  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:04:07):**  Warkup and then Ebola hit and everything shut down and they had to leave.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:04:12):**  In my mind, that would have been an easy time to just say, look, we gave it a few years.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:04:16):**  We gave it a really good shot.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:04:17):**  Let's go back to our higher paying jobs and our families and our country of birth.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:04:22):**  But they didn't.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:04:23):**  They came back and continued trying to help these farmers and still to this day are continuing.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:04:29):**  I think they're just incredibly bright.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:04:32):**  It's rare that you find such a great combination of intelligence and worldly experience along  
**[0:04:39-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:04:39):**  with heart, along with this incredible empathy and compassion to solve one of the world's  
**[0:04:45-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:04:45):**  most pressing problems.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:04:47):**  So that's what attracted me and made me want to invest in Wark.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:04:52):**  And I was born in Africa myself.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:04:54):**  So I have this heart connection to the continent.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:04:58):**  There has always been one of the big causes in my life that I've wanted to try and shift  
**[0:05:03-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:05:03):**  to make a difference in.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:05:06):**  And after traveling to Sierra Leone in, I think it was about 2017 or so, that just really  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:05:13):**  solidified it for me.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:05:15):**  Meeting the people, seeing how resilient and warm and hardworking they are, even after  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:05:20):**  Ebola and the civil war just really redoubled my commitment.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:05:24):**  Where do you see the biggest risk?  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:05:26):**  I'd say the biggest risks are things outside of the company's control.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:05:31):**  So political risk is one, it's a different kind of legal system and property rights system.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:05:38):**  I think they're managing that very well in terms of their relationships with communities  
**[0:05:42-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:05:42):**  and chiefs and things like that.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:05:45):**  But it's a part of the world where another civil war could break out or you could have  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:05:51):**  a large foreign power come in and put a lot of capital to work or disrupt things in some  
**[0:05:56-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:05:56):**  kind of way.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:05:57):**  So I'd say systemic risks are the biggest ones.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:06:00):**  And I don't see risk with management or Milena or Jorge's capabilities.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:06:08):**  Obviously in regenerative ag, there's always risks around weather and which seeds are going  
**[0:06:12-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:06:12):**  to take or not take and work out.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:06:15):**  At the more kind of unit economics level, I think there's some risk around repayment.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:06:21):**  And because so much of the foreign money that's come in has been philanthropic money or development  
**[0:06:27-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:06:27):**  aid, I sometimes wonder if this really does well and the farmers are feeding themselves  
**[0:06:35-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:06:35):**  and are able to make money from the excess crops.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:06:39):**  Would they perhaps some of them renege on their repayments to work for the inputs that  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:06:45):**  they've been provided and the training they've been provided and sort of take the stance  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:06:49):**  that this is really like aid and why should I pay it back to you?  
**[0:06:54-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:06:54):**  Up next, Ben Scott-Robinson of the Small Robot Company.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:06:57):**  I'm always very, very interested in technology which makes farmers more profitable and regenerative  
**[0:07:02-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:07:02):**  at the same time.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:07:03):**  So I was very happy to check in with Ben.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:07:06):**  Hi Ben, welcome to the show.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:07:08):**  Could you briefly introduce yourself and what brings you to work on soil?  
**[0:07:12-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:07:12):**  What brings me to work on the soil?  
**[0:07:14-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:07:14):**  Well, I've been working in digital tech since 1997 when the UK government very kindly paid  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:07:20):**  for me to do a six-week course in how to build internet pages after I had been unemployed  
**[0:07:26-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:07:26):**  for about a year after university.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:07:29):**  And then in 2000, I'd progressed to working for a Boston-based digital agency called Digitas  
**[0:07:36-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:07:36):**  and they kindly sent me on a course to MIT to understand what was then called human-computer  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:07:44):**  interaction and that just caused me to catch the bug.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:07:48):**  I just got into the idea of user-centered design and the importance of designing and  
**[0:07:53-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:07:53):**  developing digital products and services starting from the needs of people rather than starting  
**[0:07:59-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:07:59):**  from the technology.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:08:01):**  And because of that, I was lucky enough to work in some really groundbreaking places.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:08:04):**  I started at Hutchison Telecom in 2001, which became three, to design the first mobile on-phone  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:08:11):**  app store, the first mobile mapping applications, the first mobile music applications, all sorts  
**[0:08:17-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:08:17):**  of amazing stuff which had only really been made possible by the speed of 3G telecoms.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:08:24):**  I started an avatar-based messaging startup called TagText, which predated personalized  
**[0:08:31-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:08:31):**  messaging like Instagram was completely designed around the needs of tween kids and what they  
**[0:08:37-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:08:37):**  wanted to do with their phones and that allowed us to partner with people like Sony and Cartoon  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:08:41):**  Network and a number of youth fashion brands.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:08:45):**  We were also invited to be a trial app on the iPhone 2, which dates it.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:08:50):**  My agency that I started a little bit later called WeLoveMobile built some of the very  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:08:54):**  first interactive multiplayer augmented reality games and we were lucky enough to be able  
**[0:08:59-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:08:59):**  to build them for clients like McDonald's and Coke and Peugeot and all sorts of large  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:09:06):**  brands and companies who wanted to try this and they were really successful.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:09:10):**  We had tens of thousands of users.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:09:12):**  Certainly, it was most successful in the Nordics, which at the time and up until maybe about  
**[0:09:17-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:09:17):**  sort of 2011, 2012, were really leading the world on the mobile charge and all that predated  
**[0:09:24-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:09:24):**  Pokemon by about eight years.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:09:27):**  And so the success of my products or my clients' products has always been driven by not adopting  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:09:33):**  latest technologies, but by understanding how those technologies best fit into people's  
**[0:09:38-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:09:38):**  lives.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:09:39):**  And it's something that technologists and entrepreneurs tend to forget in the excitement  
**[0:09:45-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:09:45):**  around this sort of new wave of technology that behind it, there is a sophisticated need  
**[0:09:51-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:09:51):**  that somebody needs to answer before you can start building something to make their lives  
**[0:09:57-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:09:57):**  better.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:09:58):**  So when I was introduced to the problems in farming and the potential methods and technologies  
**[0:10:02-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:10:02):**  that could possibly resolve those problems, it really struck me that once again, the answers  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:10:08):**  existed or at least the nascent sort of structure for those answers existed.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:10:13):**  There are emerging technologies around robotics and AI that could carry out precision crop  
**[0:10:18-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:10:18):**  analysis and application.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:10:21):**  And there were a number of universities that were exploring this and there was also a number  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:10:26):**  of farmers and agronomists and growing networks that realized on the other end of the scale  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:10:31):**  that reintroducing more holistic practices, practices that had maybe been abandoned in  
**[0:10:36-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:10:36):**  the last 50 or 60 years, would allow soils and ecosystems to regenerate while being part  
**[0:10:45-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:10:45):**  of a farming process.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:10:47):**  And by aligning those soils and ecosystems and listening to them, you could build a sustainable  
**[0:10:53-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:10:53):**  farming system.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:10:54):**  But they are both a huge challenge to implement in a cost effective way.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:10:59):**  The technology is expensive, it's unreliable and it's difficult to get value out of it,  
**[0:11:04-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:11:04):**  certainly to start with.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:11:05):**  You know, farmers are fearful of this technology breaking down or becoming obsolete.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:11:10):**  And certainly for a long time, there wasn't the early stage support to go through the  
**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:11:16):**  pain of making that technology reliable and safe.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:11:21):**  And then at the other end of the spectrum, regenerative approaches require a very deep  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:11:26):**  understanding, not just of the complex systems that allow regeneration to happen, but how  
**[0:11:32-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:11:32):**  they apply to your specific farm.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:11:35):**  And they also take a long time to get right.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:11:38):**  And it takes a while before you know if you're even on the right path.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:11:42):**  So while there are an increasing number of farmers who are going down that route and  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:11:47):**  all power to them, ultimately, that will always be limited.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:11:51):**  So what was needed really is a system that could sort of bring those together, that could  
**[0:11:56-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:11:56):**  simplify the process of implementing soil saving, chemical removing and sustainable  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:12:04):**  farming practices in a way that removed the risk for farmers.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:12:09):**  So that's how we came up with the concept of farming as a service as a model and per  
**[0:12:14-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:12:14):**  plant farming as a concept and started to put it into action.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:12:22):**  What is the Small Robot Company?  
**[0:12:23-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:12:23):**  Well, Small Robot Company is the brainchild of myself and Sam, who is a fourth generation  
**[0:12:30-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:12:30):**  arable farmer.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:12:31):**  And it was formed as a result of six months worth of extensive interviews with farmers  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:12:36):**  looking to improve the way they grew arable crops.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:12:41):**  And those interviews allowed us to develop a model, a system that we call farming as  
**[0:12:46-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:12:46):**  a service and do that through an integrated platform of robots, AI and software.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:12:53):**  So we've been going for nearly four years now and we've delivered the first part of  
**[0:12:58-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:12:58):**  our service, the per plant monitoring of wheat, plants and weeds since October last year.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:13:04):**  We've got a team of about 42 engineers, roboticists, scientists who are building our service, robots  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:13:11):**  the AI and software, and who are also running the service part, so getting the robots out  
**[0:13:16-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:13:16):**  to the field and making sure they do what they need to do.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:13:19):**  We have 35 farmers who prepaid for our service in advance.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:13:23):**  They include the UK supermarket Waitrose and the UK's largest landowner, the National Trust,  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:13:30):**  and a further 160 who have signed letters of intent.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:13:33):**  And on top of that, we have 600 farmers who've invested in us through three crowdfunding  
**[0:13:39-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:13:39):**  rounds.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:13:40):**  How is your approach with integrating robots into regenerative agriculture different from  
**[0:13:45-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:13:45):**  other approaches?  
**[0:13:46-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:13:46):**  And what do you mean by per plant farming?  
**[0:13:48-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:13:48):**  So the first generation of agricultural robotics is driven by a need to simply automate existing  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:13:55):**  tasks.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:13:56):**  And there are significant financial gains to be made by reducing labor in higher value  
**[0:14:02-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:14:02):**  crops.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:14:03):**  However, it doesn't really answer those existential problems facing the farming of the world's  
**[0:14:11-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:14:11):**  staple crops.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:14:13):**  So what we wanted to develop was something that is transformative, a real sort of breakthrough  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:14:20):**  in using this technology in a new way.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:14:24):**  And we call that per plant farming.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:14:26):**  So this is a radical approach and it's focused on using lightweight autonomous vehicles to  
**[0:14:31-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:14:31):**  provide a near real time view of each crop plant as it grows through the season.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:14:38):**  And then using this view to deliver precise, timely interventions to make sure that that  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:14:45):**  plant reaches its full potential.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:14:49):**  And by doing this, we can strip out all the inefficiencies and the vast overuse of herbicides  
**[0:14:56-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:14:56):**  and pesticides and fungicides and fertilizer.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:15:00):**  And because we don't disturb or compact the soil, we allow the ecosystem of a field to  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:15:07):**  do what it does best, which is fix itself.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:15:10):**  And so this radical but simple vision ultimately can increase yields.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:15:18):**  It can increase nutrient levels within the food.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:15:22):**  It can reduce the cost of production.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:15:24):**  And it can also support the regeneration of soils and sequester carbon dioxide.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:15:32):**  And with this combined with an integrated agronomic system based on the data from a  
**[0:15:39-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:15:39):**  specific farm, it can allow for regenerative farming to be applied at scale.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:15:46):**  How do you select which plants, less weeds compete with the cash crop and thus figure  
**[0:15:50-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:15:50):**  out which one to kill?  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:15:52):**  So conventional farming has a very specific view of weeds.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:15:57):**  In essence, anything that is not a crop plant is a weed.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:16:02):**  And the approach to weed control has always been one of complete systematic destruction  
**[0:16:07-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:16:07):**  of anything in the field that is not a crop plant.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:16:10):**  And even other robotic systems out there are using either tillage to take out non-crop  
**[0:16:18-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:16:18):**  plants, which obviously also damages the soil structures and reduces carbon dioxide, or  
**[0:16:25-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:16:25):**  they use the precision spraying of glyphosate or similar herbicides.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:16:31):**  And ultimately, this is an incremental improvement on what we had before, but it's not really  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:16:38):**  understanding the ecosystem of a field in its entirety.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:16:42):**  It's still taking this very old school farming approach to things.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:16:47):**  Now, in the UK, arable fields, there are around about 23 weeds that commonly occur.  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:16:54):**  Ten of those are nasty, things like black grass and cleavers and brome, which out-compete  
**[0:17:00-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:17:00):**  crop plants that spread rapidly and are becoming increasingly resistant to herbicides.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:17:06):**  So for example, black grass on its own in the next five years is looking to be a problem  
**[0:17:11-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:17:11):**  that removes a quarter of the wheat production from the UK, a billion pound problem.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:17:18):**  So it's massive.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:17:20):**  Interestingly, four of those sort of bad weeds are actually volunteers from the previous  
**[0:17:25-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:17:25):**  year's crop.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:17:26):**  So that's whether that's barley or oilseed rape, and they need to be controlled as a  
**[0:17:32-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:17:32):**  weed for this year.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:17:33):**  Three, like things like chickweed and fat hen are only really a problem if they're allowed  
**[0:17:40-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:17:40):**  to get too competitive.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:17:41):**  If you allow too many plants per square meter to grow, if they get too dense or also if  
**[0:17:47-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:17:47):**  they get too close to the crop plants.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:17:49):**  Nine of the plants in that 23 are either little threat like dead nettles or field pansies,  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:17:58):**  or like clovers are actually beneficial to the soil and the ecosystem.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:18:02):**  And leaving all of those nine in fields actually has the advantage of creating a diverse ecosystem.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:18:11):**  That supports the soil matrix and pollinators.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:18:16):**  And simply by being there, they create an ecosystem that is more attuned to a meadow  
**[0:18:22-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:18:22):**  than a monoculture.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:18:25):**  So our target is to use our per plant view to recognize the different species of weeds  
**[0:18:31-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:18:31):**  as they emerge and take out the bad ones completely, thin out the ones that are neutral and leave  
**[0:18:38-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:18:38):**  the beneficial ones alone.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:18:39):**  Now to do this, we've developed a weeding system that uses electricity.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:18:43):**  We work with a company called Rootwave who've developed this electric weeding probe and  
**[0:18:49-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:18:49):**  automated it so that we can aim it at the target weeds that we have identified in field.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:18:58):**  And then we can use these electric probes to literally blow out the plant.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:19:05):**  So it systematically kills the plant, taking out the roots and the leaves with no real  
**[0:19:10-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:19:10):**  damage to the surrounding plants or soil.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:19:13):**  So that means at a stroke, we can convert this wheat field, we can convert this green  
**[0:19:19-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:19:19):**  desert monoculture into a vibrant, diverse and self-regenerating ecosystem that also  
**[0:19:26-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:19:26):**  happens to support the crop.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:19:28):**  What has been your progress so far as we're speaking at the beginning of 2021?  
**[0:19:33-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:19:33):**  Well, January 2021 or February 2021 as it is now, we have developed two of our robot  
**[0:19:41-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:19:41):**  types.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:19:42):**  The TOM robot, the monitoring robot is at a commercial specification.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:19:46):**  So we've spent the last four years working through a number of different iterations,  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:19:51):**  making each one lighter and more reliable and smarter and more capable of working at  
**[0:19:56-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:19:56):**  a commercial pace.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:19:57):**  So this TOM, for example, is quarter the weight of a NIO robot and has an operating  
**[0:20:03-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:20:03):**  width of six meters.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:20:05):**  It puts a third of the amount of pressure on the ground as your foot and about a tenth  
**[0:20:11-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:20:11):**  of a tractor.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:20:12):**  Dick, the non-chemical weeding robot is third generation prototype.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:20:17):**  So we have spent three years understanding the most effective way to deliver non-chemical  
**[0:20:22-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:20:22):**  weeding as a service and how to create a modular system that allows this to be delivered.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:20:28):**  As for Wilma, it's commercially deployed and in use.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:20:31):**  It's capable of handling terabytes of data and converting it into a geospatial information  
**[0:20:37-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:20:37):**  and then allowing us to create a per plant map of the field.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:20:40):**  We can differentiate between the crop plant and broadleaf weeds at emergence.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:20:45):**  We can also identify grass weeds at emergence that are indistinguishable from wheat visually  
**[0:20:52-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:20:52):**  by using specific light spectra and AI techniques.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:20:56):**  We can also convert the weed locations into a route for the Dick robot and a targeting  
**[0:21:01-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:21:01):**  regime for the electric weeding.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:21:04):**  So the rest of the season will be spent evolving our AIs for greater subtlety and picking up  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:21:11):**  other information around the crop plant, pests, soils, and working on other elements of the  
**[0:21:17-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:21:17):**  robotic parts of the service.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:21:19):**  Where would you like to stand in 12 months?  
**[0:21:21-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:21:21):**  What will 2021 bring you?  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:21:23):**  So 2021 is a big year for us.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:21:26):**  As well as working through getting Tom ready for manufacture, we will also be developing  
**[0:21:34-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:21:34):**  and evolving the commercial specification Dick robot and the electric weeding capability  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:21:41):**  so that we can deliver our first full weeding service.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:21:45):**  There's lots of subtleties within that and lots of other parts that we aim to be included  
**[0:21:50-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:21:50):**  in the platform and the service, but we'd have to be a little quiet about those for  
**[0:21:55-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:21:55):**  the moment.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:21:56):**  But with any fast moving hardware startup, we have a funding round.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:22:01):**  We are starting now with an aim to close in the next few months, probably June or July.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:22:08):**  And that money will get us to having a complete per plant service for key arable crops in  
**[0:22:15-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:22:15):**  Europe and allow us to be collecting the data for roll-out in North America and Brazil.

**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:23:09):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:23:14):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:23:18):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:23:22):**  Why are we doing this course after a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:23:26):**  audio asking the question how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:23:30):**  following the space since 2011 and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was  
**[0:23:35-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:23:35):**  time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:23:37):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:23:40):**  How have we built our decision making framework, what to focus on with the podcast?  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:23:44):**  How have we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask?  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:23:49):**  What is happening in the space?

**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:23:54):**  How to approach this space for whom is discourse?  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:23:58):**  You the soil builders and investors in this space, the soil builders, people working in  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:24:02):**  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:24:07):**  platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line  
**[0:24:12-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:24:12):**  designers, holistic management, consultants, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:24:15):**  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  
**[0:24:19-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:24:19):**  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:24:23):**  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies,

**[0:24:31-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:24:31):**  No.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:24:32):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:24:34):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:24:38):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:24:43-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:24:43):**  different means.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:24:44):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:24:49-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:24:49):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:24:52):**  Thank you.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:24:53):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:24:54-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:24:54):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:25:01):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:25:02):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:25:07-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:25:07):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:25:13):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:25:17-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:25:17):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:25:19):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:25:24):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:25:28):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:25:33):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:25:34-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:25:34):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:25:36):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:25:38):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:25:42):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:25:44):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:25:49):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking, click on  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-5#t=0:25:53):**  the link below, sign up and I'm really looking forward to your feedback.

### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2019-00-20)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now on to the podcast.  Welcome to Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food.  This is a special dedicated series on transition finance.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:32):**  Why are we recording this series?  Many farmers are ready to speed up their regenerative transition.  They've looked for learning, done the courses, read the key books, hosted the gurus on their  farms, explored farm-sized regenerative designs and most importantly started their pilots  and feedback loops.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:48):**  This is where transition finance is key.  A local bank loan often isn't feasible because of the short duration, lack of flexibility  and the farmers lack of collateral.  Furthermore, there is a limit of how much equity a farmer is able or willing to give  away.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:03):**  That is why my co-host Aspiring to Be regenerative farmer Benedikt Bösel and I are embarking  on a journey to find out what are the key principles of transition finance for regenerative  farmers.  We are interviewing leading practitioners in the regenerative agriculture and food finance  space.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:21):**  They share their insights how they would finance the speed up of the regenerative transition  on Benedikt's 1000 hectares, which is almost 2500 acres, farm in Germany close to Berlin.  This is an open process.  We are sharing our lessons through the podcast episodes as we go along.  We don't have the answers yet, just a lot of questions.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:40):**  So please share with us any examples of transition finance you've seen, other inspiration, people  to interview etc.  Get in touch via the contact page on the website investinginregenerativeagriculture.com  that is investinginregenerativeagriculture.com.  It's time to talk a bit about the farm and to see we prepared a nice document with an  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:05):**  overview which will definitely link in the description below or wherever you're listening  to this podcast.  So you can read this back.  But we can do a few highlights of the farm just to have an idea of size.  What are we talking about?  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:16):**  And I mean, I think you already guessed that it's not a small one.  It's definitely bigger than your average few hectares.  And so, can you give a short overview of Guttenbösel in terms of the farm, but also the bigger  platform as you described it?  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:33):**  I mean, basically, we are a family farm.  So my both of my parents live here, my two older sisters live here with their kids.  Obviously I live here.  And what we're doing as a whole group, I guess, is basically ecological agriculture on roughly  1,000 hectares, forestry on another 2,000 hectares.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:51):**  There's a bed and breakfast with a couple of double rooms.  We have a small bakery that we use or that we can use.  There is an old English garden that we look after as well as, you know, the, let's say,  different farm infrastructure that some of which you can use as an event room.  And we pretty much run all of that with, let's say, a total of 20 employees.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:17):**  I guess as far as the agricultural land is concerned, as I said, our average ground points  is around 35, which I think is a very German thing to say.  I'm not sure if it's actually internationally known, but just to give you an idea.  So it's a classification of soil quality, whereas 100 is, you know, as good as it gets  and zero being the lowest.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:40):**  If you're on a-  So you're definitely in the lower region.  Yeah, I think for Brandenburg, like the county that we're in, it's actually not that bad.  There's some that are worse.  But to give you an example, if you stand on the beach and you have the sand on your feet,  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:54):**  then that's probably 16, 17, 18 ground points and we are 35.  So it should give you a good estimate of the quality.  So our average plot size is around 40 hectares and most of the fields are nicely situated  around the farm, I guess.  So on a production note, we basically, our focus is grain production.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:18):**  Well, our focus as of now is grain production, between 70, 75% is actually in grain production.  Usually we have spelt, barley, rye, wheat, all the classic ones.  The rest is really legumes like sweet lupine and alfalfa.  And I mean, this is basically the farm structure when I started over.  What we have done since then and started with and experimenting with is basically different  
**[0:04:46-0:04:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:46):**  forms of regenerative agriculture.  First of all, let's say a classical agroforestry system where we planted different species  of poplar and widow on a large field of roughly 30 hectares.  And those are basically just thin lines, double rows evenly dispersed over the field, really  to see the effect on actually the grain production.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:09):**  So we know from the science that even if I reduce the agricultural land by let's say  five to 10% by introducing those tree lines, I could probably have the same yield on the  remaining the same or even higher yield on the remaining agriculture field just because  of the introduction of the ecosystem functions of the biomass of the tree lines.  And I think that is so applicable to the place that we are.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:36):**  I mean, we have this incredible drought time between really early spring, early summer.  Also afterwards, the ground temperature sometimes reaches, I guess, 70, 80%.  You have this amazing radiation, heat, dryness.  Any tree, anything that can block that basically will help changing the local, the microclimate.  Exactly.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:59):**  So I think that changing microclimate between the tree lines, I think it's going to have  a huge impact also on an erosion.  Wind erosion is going to be a big thing.  And then I mean, if there is water, if it rains, obviously the soil is in a way that  it actually can't take up any of it.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:17):**  So I think that agroforestry, that let's say simple agroforestry system is going to be  very interested.  We have a couple of scientific facilities that are also monetizing the soil development,  let's say, or monitoring the soil development, which I think is going to be-  Monetizing would be great.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:34):**  Yeah.  That's the next step.  I was going to say.  Wow, you're advanced.  Wow.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:39):**  It's automatic.  It's transferring a Bitcoin straight to you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll see how it goes depending on the outcome.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:45):**  Maybe you'll then think about it.  But yeah.  Then we have a project together with Ernst Goetsch, which is from Switzerland.  He developed in Switzerland as well as in Brazil, basically a style of agroforestry,  biodynamic agroforestry, I would call it.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:03):**  It's called syntropic agriculture.  She's extremely advanced, right?  And I think you're one of the first or maybe even the first to do, first of all, at scale,  this is three and a half hectares in Germany.  I don't think I've seen anybody getting, first of all, Ernst Goetsch to Germany and then  
**[0:07:19-0:07:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:19):**  actually implementing one of these projects.  Or am I wrong?  Yeah.  It took some motivation, I guess, to bring him over.  But I mean, his way of doing agriculture is quite popular in Brazil, in Argentina, and  
**[0:07:36-0:07:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:36):**  also on a large scale.  So it is being proven in a way there already.  And he started a couple of projects in Europe, one in Spain, one in Switzerland, one in Portugal,  and a few others.  And then we are lucky to have him in Germany as well.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:51):**  And well, the idea is really, and I think actually this is something so fascinating  about all those different lines of thought of regenerative ag.  It's always the same characteristics, really.  I mean, it's always about keeping the soil covered, having a diverse crop rotation, have  a large diversity of plants and animals, all the large ones, less soil disturbance, obviously.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:17):**  And it's the same with the syntropic one.  And whenever I have visitors, then everyone is always like, yeah, but how can syntropic  agriculture work in your environment?  And I always say, well, we're not going to plant any coca trees or bananas.  Exactly.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:32):**  But the principles are similar, right?  And obviously we're testing and developing.  We'll never be ready.  But as from what we already can see today, I mean, there's just incredible potential  to it.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:46):**  And what we are is basically having an agroforestry system where we're not only looking obviously  at popular, but we're looking at a combination of pioneering species with nut trees, a pioneering  species with different fruit trees, fruit bushes, having different layers within one  tree line and obviously different potential usages at different times, all having some  sort of synergetic effect with each other and helping each other on different level,  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:13):**  be it through fungi, be it through shadows, be it through different root structures.  So very versatile, very complex.  And those systems are always designed in a way that part of the system is actually for  the system itself.  Basically, the pioneer species will be pruned each year and the biomass that is being cut  
**[0:09:33-0:09:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:33):**  is then brought back onto the soil to stimulate, let's say, nutrients and food for the soil  microbiology and biology, obviously.  And another part of the system is for producing nutritious food for people or actually animals  also.  And so that is a system that we're trying and we've just planted, I think, 1,500 trees  
**[0:09:57-0:10:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:57):**  and bushes a couple of weeks or actually two weeks ago.  So then our next project is the-  The animals, yeah.  You were mentioning them already.  Yeah.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:06):**  Yeah, holistic grazing, following Alan Savery, at least we're trying to, but it's really  tough when it comes to having your mobile fence and having no rain for eight weeks.  And I haven't yet found a mobile fence that is hard enough or good enough to get into  the ground.  So much to be learned.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:28):**  But anyway, so-  Maybe some people that are listening that are operating in more desert-like circumstances  have some tips for you.  Yeah, basically, I know there's like, we need that rolling kind of fence that is like on,  I think, five different poles and it rolls above the ground.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:45):**  I think that is a good way of doing it.  Because our soil gets as hard as stone, pretty much.  If it doesn't rain for a while, then there's just nothing you can put in there as a fence.  But basically, we have pretty much 20 cows.  We'll have our first calves, had our first calves a couple of weeks ago.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:06):**  We'll have another 20 hyphers coming beginning of next year's.  And another part of our herd is going to have their cows also beginning next year.  So we'll have around 60 heads starting the year.  And obviously, practicing, let's say, rotational grazing and learning and observing as much  as we can.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:33):**  One thing that we'll be starting to build within the next couple of weeks is our first  mobile laying hen house, as well as three little groups for the broilers.  And the broilers will go into the syntropic testing grounds and the laying hens will then  start to follow the cows in spring next year.  And as you have so much grain, you for sure also have some leftovers to feed them.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:02):**  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, I think that is really one of the concepts that are easy to grasp.  Basically, use potential side-offs or things that you don't actually have usage for and  see how you can somehow create some value from it.  And as far as the grain is concerned, I mean, we have a cleaning facility for the grain,  
**[0:12:24-0:12:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:24):**  so there's so much leftover, so much potential garbage grain, so to say, that is a great  feed potentially.  So we definitely use that.  And same with potential compost components.  We've started doing some different experiments with composting.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:45):**  So the classical vermicompost, we've built four bioreactors following the Johnson-Sue  model, which we're really, let's say, fascinated and also excited about to get that microbiology  and the bacteria and the fungi going.  So yeah, it's a good project.  I could provide some photos of that later on as well.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:09):**  They look very impressive, I have to say.  And you were mentioning that they actually get to some good temperatures, but obviously  we have to see over the next months how that develops.  And when you think, I want to spend a few minutes, I want to be conscious of our time  as well, to spend a few minutes on when I say transition finance or when somebody mentions  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:33):**  that in this context of this farm, what does that trigger to you?  What would you be able to do if you had appropriate transition finance and what would that mean  in terms of these projects that you just mentioned?  And the pilots, some are maybe out of pilot phase, some are definitely in the pilot phase.  What would you do with transition finance?  
**[0:13:54-0:13:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:54):**  That's a good question.  Which we're going to explore in the next episode.  So like the first few thoughts, what comes to mind now on this Friday afternoon?  Exactly.  I mean, what comes to mind?  
**[0:14:08-0:14:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:08):**  First of all, I think there is a couple of learnings that one needs to have done or needs  to be in in order to know the way and the how which is applicable to the one in question.  I think that's something that we are really figuring out right now and we already have  some quite a good idea of what I understand or what I would like to understand, I guess,  when I hear transitioning finance.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:40):**  It's basically a partner, a way of having a partner that in the best case understands  the situation that I am in, that we're in, understands why we want to change, how we  can change, why it is profitable to go that way and by saying profitable, I don't only  talk about monetization for me as a farmer or as us as a farm operation, but obviously  talk about the ecological side of it, the social potential and let's say the industry  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:15):**  as a whole.  And on top of that, having that idea of changing fundamental habits and changing a horizon  and that in a way that gives you the leeway to actually rethink certain ways and processes  and also have the time.  I think I always call it…  
**[0:15:43-0:15:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:43):**  Time is an interesting one.  Yeah, have the time.  To be honest with you, I always call it emotional freedom.  That's what it is for me because we are faced with so many pressures and fears and  risks.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:59):**  It's sometimes as beautiful and inspiring and great it is to be a farmer and to be outside  and to do all of those things.  It is a huge pressure that you have.  It's a huge responsibility you have.  It's not only the family and the family of the people who are working on the farm.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:22):**  It goes beyond that.  And I think in order to be able to change and to facilitate change, you can't work  freely if you have that pressure on you all the time and if you have those fears about  the future all the time.  So for me, that idea of transitioning is also to have the feeling that you're not alone  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:43):**  in this game and there's someone or an institute that is being part of it, that understands  it, that goes through the highs as well as the lows and that you can rely on.  And obviously that goes both ways.  And what in this case, you mentioned a number of PYDA projects and obviously we'll dive  deeper into the different ones and we'll dive deeper with gas into all the aspects of transition  
**[0:17:13-0:17:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:13):**  finance.  And obviously that's going to change over years as new things, a lot of lessons will  be learned.  Would it now be mostly, is it safe to say that most of, let's say if you've got transition  finance, whatever shape or form that will take, now it would be, you would use it to  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:30):**  speed up the implementation of some of these because some are 30 hectares, some are three  and a half, but it's very expensive to do cover crops everywhere.  And it's very expensive to plant trees and very risky because not everything has been  figured out yet.  So you are looking for basically fuel to speed up the process and at the same time by time,  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:52):**  like it's this constant tension between speeding up and actually going slower and take a step  back and actually have that emotional freedom which you mentioned.  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, that is completely right.  I think when it comes to the level on the ground level of the different projects, I  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:12):**  would have a pretty good idea of where to start if I was going to speed up or if I wanted  to speed up.  And what kind of sizes are we thinking of?  Is it, are we discussing 5,000, 500,000, 5 million or 50 million?  What is the dimension without going into Euro details, what are dimensions people should  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:31):**  think about if they're going to also help us and reach out with feedback, with ideas,  with people to interview, et cetera, that we are talking about at this large scale farm  because it is a thousand hectares plus the forestry part where we talk about the farming  part now.  What are the dimensions you are at least thinking of and calculating with, let's say in your  
**[0:18:49-0:18:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:49):**  models?  Yeah, basically, I mean, obviously there's different ways of, let's say the speediness  of the process that you want to take and also the scale that you want to consider.  But from what I've experienced so far from the things that I've seen and I think I have  a good idea also of, let's say the financial applications, I would probably have a discussion  
**[0:19:15-0:19:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:15):**  of, let's say something between 500,000 and a million to really take a couple of bigger  steps.  And I think that's already quite a lot.  It's a lot and it's nothing if we talk about some movements in the space or movements in  the finance space.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:37):**  But yeah, obviously it's an enormous amount of money if you look at your general bank  account.  Exactly.  And I mean, this is really where suddenly that whole discussion of transition financing  on an emotional level makes you feel how important it is.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:55):**  Because if you think that in a usual bank loan, so to say, having that figure just in  front of you, that is a lot of money on the farm level, let's say.  And I think that it makes it quite tangible why that whole idea of transition financing  is so important.  Because you have to think about a way that you can work with that money and actually  
**[0:20:19-0:20:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:19):**  develop and achieve what you're setting out to or what you're trying to in a way that,  yeah, as we've already said, give you the freedom and the time to actually work with  it and not having to worry and not having to think about annuities and the bank that  is not going to be on your side of the table.  It's not going to be part of it.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:45):**  Exactly.  I think that's a critical part, really.  We would love it to be.  I mean, if your local bank, I'm talking to all the farmers that hopefully listen, is  that partner and has the principles that we're going to explore in this series and is honoring  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:59):**  that, then obviously, it will be ideal.  And if you are, you can find that money somewhere.  But what we've seen in many of these discussions, like this finance to transition farms often  isn't there or is very badly or unfairly, let's say, structured.  So we're going to explore those questions and they're going to be uncomfortable questions  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:17):**  and they're going to be difficult ones in the next episodes with guests actually on  the show.  So we're going to have people that are deep into the space and going to ask them to see  and look at this case and say, OK, how would you finance this if you were in those shoes?  So I'm extremely excited to explore that further over the next months and dive deeper into  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:36):**  the transition finance piece and everything that that unlocks as well.  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, I guess I'm kind of looking for.  It's a combination of looking forward and being scared of the kind of things that we'll  have to talk about, the kind of connections that we'll make, I think are going to be incredibly  
**[0:21:56-0:21:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:56):**  interesting.  And you know, it'd be great to hear also from from a potential audience that is interested  in the space, what kind of questions they have and what kind of problems they see or  fears that they have, because I think as far as farmers farming is concerned, it's so heterogeneous.  And you know, the things and the questions that I ask, the problems that I have, the  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:19):**  considerations that I think about are obviously all my problems.  And this is supposedly really not about me.  It's just an idea of starting a conversation on, let's say, on a farmer's level.  So yeah, I mean, it'd be great to hear some other.  Get in touch.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:37):**  Yeah.

**[0:23:34-0:23:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:34):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question, how to put money  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:52):**  to work in regenerating soils, and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  How have we built our decision making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[0:24:09-0:24:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:09):**  How have we picked interviewees?  And what questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?  What should you read?  What should you listen?  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:17):**  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course?  You the soil builders and investors in the space, the soil builders, people working in  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing,  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:32):**  platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line  designers, holistic management consultants, etc, etc.  People that are building soil at scale.  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  or as private individuals, or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:50):**  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  Is this course free?  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:03):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  different means.  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you, and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:17):**  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes, plus PDF slides,  so you don't have to ride along.  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:37):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  find if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're gonna look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  
**[0:25:57-0:25:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:57):**  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:08):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

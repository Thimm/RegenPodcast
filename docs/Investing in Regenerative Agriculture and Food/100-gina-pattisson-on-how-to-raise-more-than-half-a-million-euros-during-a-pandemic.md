**[0:00:13-0:00:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:00:13):**  How to raise capital during a pandemic?  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:00:15):**  What can we learn from a very experienced non-profit fundraiser who joined a Regen Egg  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:00:20):**  tech startup two years ago and during this pandemic had to completely pivot their fundraising  
**[0:00:24-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:00:24):**  plans and was still able to raise more than half a million?  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:00:30):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:00:34):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:00:36):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:00:40):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:00:45):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:00:50):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:00:52):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:00:56):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:00:58):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:01:03):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:01:07):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:12-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:01:12):**  our work.

**[0:01:32-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:01:32):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:01:34):**  So welcome to another episode today with Gina Pettersson, founding team member of Soar Heroes,  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:01:38):**  making nature everyone's business and getting farmers paid for the ecosystem services they  
**[0:01:43-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:01:43):**  provide.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:01:44):**  Just a caveat, I'm an advisor to Soar Heroes.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:01:46):**  We've interviewed Jeroen Klompe, one of the other founders previously here, and I will  
**[0:01:50-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:01:50):**  definitely link that below if you want to know a lot more about the history and what  
**[0:01:54-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:01:54):**  Soar Heroes is building.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:01:55):**  But today with Gina, we're going to dive into something slightly different, how you're raising  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:01:59):**  during this crazy year, the 2020 is during a pandemic during COVID.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:02:04):**  And when you're raising money for quite an innovative and new business.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:02:08):**  So Gina, thank you so much for coming on the show today.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:02:11):**  And I'm very much looking forward to diving deep into raising during a pandemic.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:02:16):**  Thank you.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:02:17):**  And to start with a personal question I always love to ask because I know you don't come  
**[0:02:20-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:02:20):**  from the soil world.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:02:22):**  How did you end up focusing all of your attention and energy on rebuilding soils?  
**[0:02:28-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:02:28):**  There's a long answer and there's a short answer.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:02:29):**  I want a long one.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:02:32):**  So I've spent the last 20 years working in international development with a big belief  
**[0:02:39-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:02:39):**  that the world can function differently.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:02:41):**  I've been fundraising for water projects in Tajikistan, for maternal health projects in  
**[0:02:49-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:02:49):**  Yemen, for livelihood programs in Eastern Africa, and all the time looking in the eyes of the  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:02:57):**  funders and saying, you really are making a difference because I can hand on heart from  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:03:01):**  my own personal experience, actually visiting places all over the world have seen firsthand  
**[0:03:06-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:03:06):**  the impact that external support can bring communities who perhaps are limited in certain  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:03:12):**  resources or knowledge and need help to pivot.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:03:16):**  That said, there's always that challenging question of, are you going to come back in  
**[0:03:20-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:03:20):**  20 years time?  
**[0:03:21-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:03:21):**  And will you have solved this problem?  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:03:23):**  And in the end, when I discovered actually the first thing I watched was Green Gold,  
**[0:03:29-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:03:29):**  when I discovered that in fact, everything begins with the soil beneath our feet, because  
**[0:03:35-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:03:35):**  when you fix our soil, you fix our climate problems.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:03:37):**  When you fix our soil, you fix people's resilience of their own crops that they're growing.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:03:41):**  They can be independent.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:03:44):**  And when you fix your soils, you're actually fixing your own health because it's changing  
**[0:03:48-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:03:48):**  what you eat.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:03:49):**  That for me was really literally scales falling from my eyes.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:03:54):**  Having worked for an environmental organizations, for development organizations, having worked  
**[0:03:58-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:03:58):**  for Unilever, suddenly there I was realizing, why is it that for 20 years in all of this  
**[0:04:04-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:04:04):**  work, I haven't actually been talking about soil health?  
**[0:04:07-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:04:07):**  So for me, there's no going back.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:04:10):**  It's pretty clear that this is, you know, I would hope that it could be a 10 year job  
**[0:04:15-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:04:15):**  and then it's done.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:04:16):**  I'm not sure that's going to be the case.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:04:18):**  But certainly for me, the mission is extremely clear.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:04:22):**  I think when we address how we use our land, we address all of those other ensuing challenges.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:04:28):**  And do you still remember, was there like one moment you mentioned Green Gold, which  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:04:32):**  I will link below in the show notes, which is a great documentary of John Lue?  
**[0:04:36-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:04:36):**  Did you see that and then you saw it?  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:04:38):**  Or did you see the documentary when you were already interested in soil?  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:04:42):**  Like, was there one moment where suddenly you saw, I wouldn't say the sort of light,  
**[0:04:47-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:04:47):**  or was it a gradual process where you got more interested in what's happening under  
**[0:04:50-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:04:50):**  our feet?  
**[0:04:51-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:04:51):**  No, I was actually approached because I live in the Netherlands.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:04:54):**  I'm from Scotland, from the UK.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:04:56):**  Very appropriate that it's St Andrew's Day today because I'm actually from St Andrew's.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:05:00):**  So thank you for that.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:05:02):**  Should I say congratulations?  
**[0:05:03-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:05:03):**  I don't know.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:05:04):**  If so, congratulations.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:05:05):**  We don't do the Dutch thing.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:05:07):**  Congratulations on someone else's birthday.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:05:12):**  And so I found myself in the Netherlands.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:05:14):**  I had been in global roles, I was in regional roles.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:05:16):**  And by that I mean, traveling to South Africa, traveling all around Europe.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:05:19):**  And with a young family, in the end, you realize it's a choice that either your home and around  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:05:25):**  or it's and I had spent 20 odd years of traveling.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:05:30):**  And in very full, all consuming roles.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:05:34):**  So I chose to look for something more locally in the Netherlands, which was a bit challenging  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:05:40):**  because of my fundraising background, bringing this kind of very global horizons to the small  
**[0:05:45-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:05:45):**  town of Middleburg, which actually is internationally known, I've since discovered, but nevertheless,  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:05:51):**  working out what can I purposefully do that is a good employment of my skills and all  
**[0:05:57-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:05:57):**  of my experience.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:05:59):**  And somebody shared with me, you really need to get to know this very cool team in Amsterdam  
**[0:06:04-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:06:04):**  that's working on land restoration.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:06:06):**  Take a look, they're looking for somebody they need to start from scratch, kind of on  
**[0:06:10-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:06:10):**  the more fundraising side.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:06:13):**  And so that's what I stepped in.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:06:15):**  And interestingly,  
**[0:06:16-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:06:16):**  That was the first time you heard land restoration?  
**[0:06:19-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:06:19):**  Or was that like, did it catch your eye?  
**[0:06:21-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:06:21):**  Like, oh, that sounds interesting.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:06:22):**  Or it was like, oh, what's that?  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:06:23):**  No, I mean, through the work with Oxfam and Save the Children, of course, there's big  
**[0:06:27-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:06:27):**  streams of programs.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:06:29):**  But in terms of really understanding the nexus of soil health and community thriving, and  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:06:38):**  how you connect that through to the food that you eat or the clothes that you buy, I think  
**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:06:42):**  it's the soil health component for me that was really strikingly new, if you like.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:06:48):**  Then you ended up at Soil Heroes.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:06:49):**  And how would you I mean, in a startup, there are six zillion roles to fill, and the early  
**[0:06:55-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:06:55):**  team fills them all.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:06:56):**  But how would you describe your role if somebody asked you, okay, what do you actually do at  
**[0:07:01-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:07:01):**  Soil Heroes?  
**[0:07:02-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:07:02):**  Like right now, we're talking November, December 2020.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:07:05):**  Obviously it has been shifting.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:07:06):**  How would you describe your most of how you spend your time?  
**[0:07:10-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:07:10):**  Most of how I spent my time is talking with a wide range of who I call change makers.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:07:18):**  So internationally, people who are passionate about changing the way that we use our land  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:07:24):**  have a vision for a different way of operating, whether it's from the financial world, from  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:07:29):**  the food sector, whether it's farmers, of course, predominantly also investors.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:07:34):**  That said, I also speak with other organizations who are more like peers.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:07:40):**  So I guess you could describe me as a bit of the team scout, sort of having those initial  
**[0:07:45-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:07:45):**  conversations.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:07:46):**  I'm enormously, I have like so much gratitude for the referrals that are made to my inbox  
**[0:07:53-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:07:53):**  heaves under the weight sometimes, but people connecting us to other people.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:08:00):**  So I think really it's opening doors, aligning, discovering where our visions connect, and  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:08:07):**  then being able to bring that meaningfully to the team in a way that we can gain traction.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:08:11):**  Or in some cases, it's good to know that you exist and we exist super.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:08:15):**  We will, we're on the same journey on going and we follow each other.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:08:20):**  And it doesn't always need action when you first meet with someone, but it's about building  
**[0:08:25-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:08:25):**  the...  
**[0:08:26-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:08:26):**  My big thing is joining the dots, as you know.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:08:28):**  So it's then working out which dots need to be joined and what's the best way to join  
**[0:08:32-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:08:32):**  them.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:08:33):**  And if you take us back to, let's say, January, February, or maybe even March, early March,  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:08:37):**  when you were in full swing of racing around with Sorry Heroes, and slowly this pandemic  
**[0:08:43-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:08:43):**  thing became much more serious than we all thought.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:08:46):**  I certainly underestimated it greatly at the beginning of the year.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:08:49):**  I remember our conversations.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:08:52):**  But I also saw some things going out there saying this is going to be a very, very long  
**[0:08:58-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:08:58):**  winter, let's say for fundraising.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:09:00):**  And if you haven't closed now and stuff is in the bank, then this is going to...  
**[0:09:04-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:09:04):**  Because people are going to hit the brakes, going to postpone, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:09:07):**  So if you take us back to, let's say, February, when it started to become slowly clear that  
**[0:09:11-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:09:11):**  something was probably going to derail a few things, what was your thinking then about  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:09:17):**  the round you were raising and if that would be even possible?  
**[0:09:21-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:09:21):**  Or was it, okay, all hands on deck, let's see what we have now in and let's see how  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:09:24):**  we survive until, I don't know, next winter or something?  
**[0:09:28-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:09:28):**  What do you remember February last year?  
**[0:09:29-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:09:29):**  Or this year, sorry, we're still in the same year.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:09:31):**  No, it's a good question.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:09:33):**  So coming back to your previous question, taking a step back, I spent a lot of my time  
**[0:09:39-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:09:39):**  raising what you could call philanthropic funds.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:09:42):**  So I worked very much in the kind of the charity sector, the charity space.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:09:46):**  Because during that time, it was very evolving.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:09:48):**  I think in the end, if you look at it, they're big businesses and there are lots of challenges  
**[0:09:53-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:09:53):**  kind of, is charity dead?  
**[0:09:54-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:09:54):**  Actually, is this the right kind of money?  
**[0:09:57-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:09:57):**  And then as I say, I joined a land restoration organization here in the Netherlands and whilst  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:10:03):**  we needed to fundraise for grants, discovered actually most people coming through the door  
**[0:10:08-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:10:08):**  were impact investors.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:10:09):**  And so for me, for myself personally, this was a transition into a different kind of  
**[0:10:16-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:10:16):**  funding.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:10:17):**  I'm not from an investment fund background.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:10:19):**  And so my own kind of concerns about, well, I don't know the technicalities of deals and  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:10:25):**  what do I need to learn about the financial language and so on.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:10:29):**  And discovered, and I coined a phrase at the time, as you will remember, discovered that  
**[0:10:33-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:10:33):**  actually the principles are the same.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:10:36):**  In the end, it's about what's the purpose, what's your mission, what's your intention?  
**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:10:41):**  That's what purpose means, essentially.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:10:43):**  What's your intention?  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:10:44):**  And when you talk about impact, are you looking for impact that is environmental, that is  
**[0:10:50-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:10:50):**  social, for yourself, for your pocket?  
**[0:10:52-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:10:52):**  And I think having those really hard discussions and I back then was operating very much in  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:10:59):**  the kind of the sweet spot between the hardcore investment and the charity, which of course  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:11:03):**  we call impact investing and the term that I coined, as I say, was the investable grant.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:11:08):**  So how can we ensure that whatever kind of funding is given, that it is building towards  
**[0:11:14-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:11:14):**  something that is going to become investable or is going to be sustainable financially?  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:11:20):**  In other words, it creates its own business model in the end.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:11:24):**  So there's a number of things in there.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:11:27):**  Business model means profit.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:11:30):**  And let's face it, profit is and can be good.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:11:33):**  The question is, is it your main driver?  
**[0:11:36-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:11:36):**  And if purpose is your main driver, and this is where I love what Paul Palman has been  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:11:42):**  speaking about, particularly with the Business for Nature community, actually it's not profit  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:11:47):**  for purpose, it's profit through purpose.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:11:51):**  And the reason I share this is because when COVID struck and it became clear, and I think  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:11:57):**  we were extremely naive, I'm a little bit disappointed, if I'm honest, by the Western  
**[0:12:01-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:12:01):**  kind of hemisphere, because it first arose in China and there was a sense of it's over  
**[0:12:07-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:12:07):**  there.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:12:08):**  And by goodness, it really, those are words that everyone can eat because...  
**[0:12:12-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:12:12):**  The latest research in Italy shows it went around already in September last year.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:12:16):**  Doesn't surprise me at all.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:12:18):**  They see a lot of, they froze a lot of blood samples from another research and now they  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:12:22):**  went back to see and they had antibodies in there, like a good 11.6 or 12% of the people  
**[0:12:27-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:12:27):**  in certain cities in the North had already antibodies of COVID-19, which is very interesting  
**[0:12:33-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:12:33):**  for our eyes.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:12:34):**  It is.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:12:35):**  January was like, oh, it's there, don't worry.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:12:36):**  It's not going to travel.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:12:37):**  And it kind of, that also comes to my point, which is in the end, it's about perceptions  
**[0:12:44-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:12:44):**  and it's about realities.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:12:46):**  And people talk about it started in China and actually, you know, good on the research  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:12:50):**  there that actually identified it and was able to flag it to the world when probably  
**[0:12:54-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:12:54):**  it started somewhere else.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:12:56):**  And so my big rule of thumb with fundraising, and this brings me to the COVID challenge  
**[0:13:01-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:13:01):**  that you've asked me, is never assume.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:13:04):**  You don't make assumptions.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:13:05):**  You need to peel things back, really understand.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:13:09):**  And what it is, is what it is.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:13:11):**  And particularly in my role as a fundraiser, it's not for me to, to some extent challenge,  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:13:17):**  yes, but in the end, if there's core values and they are different to other core values  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:13:21):**  and they have very clear pathways that do not diverge, then it's a case of respecting,  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:13:26):**  respectfully acknowledging that that is a path that goes in a different direction to  
**[0:13:30-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:13:30):**  yours.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:13:31):**  So there's some subtle work there.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:13:33):**  In terms of when COVID struck, the way I see it is what I was imagining back in February,  
**[0:13:39-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:13:39):**  I was pretty, pretty bold.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:13:42):**  My view was, okay, this is the moment for impact investment to really step up because  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:13:49):**  in fact, it doesn't change a thing because we still are not using our lands properly.  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:13:54):**  We still need to change how we work, how we see farmers, how we understand the food that  
**[0:14:00-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:14:00):**  we put in our mouths, the clothes that we choose to wear.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:14:03):**  Probably makes it more important.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:14:04):**  Exactly.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:14:05):**  And we've very much seen that since that has definitely come to be the case that there  
**[0:14:10-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:14:10):**  is now a sharpened understanding and appetite for going deeper into growing things better,  
**[0:14:17-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:14:17):**  building back better, growing things better.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:14:18):**  That's what I'd say.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:14:20):**  And did the funders agree?  
**[0:14:21-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:14:21):**  Because you can be bold, but if the other part you're talking to is sort of going back  
**[0:14:28-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:14:28):**  down, like everything risky, because we've seen that with some people, with other people  
**[0:14:31-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:14:31):**  actually not.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:14:32):**  Like it's really a two response.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:14:34):**  Some people move forward and see this as the moment and push with their portfolio, with  
**[0:14:38-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:14:38):**  their investments, et cetera.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:14:39):**  But some others are, okay, let's talk in 2021 because I'm not making any sudden rushes.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:14:44):**  Also because you saw in March, like the stock market crashing, oil markets crashing.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:14:49):**  Some people lost a lot of money, made it probably back in, hopefully back in the last months,  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:14:53):**  but it was a very scary moment on the financial markets.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:14:56):**  There was a lot of sudden tension.  
**[0:14:58-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:14:58):**  So what was there?  
**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:14:59):**  You felt bold.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:15:01):**  What did the other people feel?  
**[0:15:03-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:15:03):**  In fundraising, I can't imagine why you'd be in fundraising if you're not passionate.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:15:06):**  You're very passionate completely from what you're doing.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:15:09):**  So it's relatively easy to be bold.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:15:12):**  As you say, at the same time, it's naive to ignore what's going on around you.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:15:17):**  You have to listen.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:15:19):**  And I'm also very strong.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:15:20):**  I was sharing with somebody the other day, why is listening not the first language that  
**[0:15:24-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:15:24):**  we're taught at school?  
**[0:15:26-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:15:26):**  It's so extremely important sometimes to actually stop and hear the noise, if not at least what's  
**[0:15:33-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:15:33):**  actually being said, to hear what is and understand other people's perspectives.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:15:39):**  So we were bold deliberately in order to keep going because it was very important that we  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:15:45):**  didn't just kind of hit the pause button that's all heroes and say, okay, there's pandemic,  
**[0:15:50-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:15:50):**  people are nervous.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:15:51):**  Let's wait.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:15:52):**  There's no time to wait.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:15:54):**  So by being bold, we kept our confidence, we kept our resilience.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:15:58):**  And at the same time, we did really lean in to understand, okay, what does this mean for  
**[0:16:04-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:16:04):**  the investment community that we're working with?  
**[0:16:08-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:16:08):**  We do need to apply a big dose of caution, we need to work with that, how can that look?  
**[0:16:14-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:16:14):**  And so we went from two commitments of a million euros each, almost on the verge of signing  
**[0:16:21-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:16:21):**  that had to go on hold.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:16:24):**  And the best thing that I think strongly believe the best thing that we did is to, instead  
**[0:16:29-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:16:29):**  of pushing that, is to immediately stand on the same side and work with those parties  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:16:35):**  to see how can we reconfigure this?  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:16:39):**  Because it's working together in the end, it's not a trans, yes, okay, funding goes  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:16:43):**  from A to B, but it's not a transaction as such, it's a relationship, it's a journey,  
**[0:16:48-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:16:48):**  it's co-creating that you can have impact and really change something.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:16:51):**  If you're change makers, then you're doing it together.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:16:54):**  So when you have a crisis that can feel very polarizing and feel quite difficult, because  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:16:59):**  suddenly, if somebody is putting pause on their investments, you don't want to push.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:17:05):**  At the same time, if you are listening, and you are working together, then you find new  
**[0:17:11-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:17:11):**  ways through.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:17:12):**  So we changed our approach and went for convertible loan for a much smaller amount and worked  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:17:19):**  out that amount based on what do we need to get to our next milestone.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:17:25):**  And that milestone is very simple.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:17:27):**  It's completely what we're all about as Soil Heroes.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:17:30):**  It was how do we bring new income to farmers, so a million euros of extra funding to farmers  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:17:40):**  who are transitioning to regenerative agriculture, and it's around 4000 hectares that would be  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:17:46):**  restored, and all of the beautiful things that they achieve for us by farming with nature  
**[0:17:51-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:17:51):**  in restoring those hectares.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:17:53):**  So we worked out that we needed around a million euros ourselves.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:17:56):**  So with a million euros, we could keep the team running, build all the extra functionalities,  
**[0:18:02-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:18:02):**  team members and achieve that.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:18:05):**  Get the hectares on board.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:18:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:18:07):**  Yeah, bring the farmers on board, support them in their transition and achieve that  
**[0:18:11-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:18:11):**  milestone.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:18:12):**  So by going into a much smaller, so effectively, we were looking, okay, and you have to take  
**[0:18:16-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:18:16):**  the long term view.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:18:18):**  We need to do a short term, lean round that keeps us nimble, keeps us able to, you know,  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:18:24):**  we can keep flowing, that secures the connections and relationships that we have.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:18:29):**  Put some money in the pockets of farmers and show that you can do this.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:18:33):**  And then with the strong conviction that if you're able to put more than a million euros  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:18:40):**  into the hands of farmers, you're able to raise more or to build this machine bigger,  
**[0:18:45-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:18:45):**  bolder.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:18:46):**  Exactly.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:18:47):**  Proof of concept.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:18:48):**  So by getting proof of concept, if we could essentially secure the team, prove that there  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:18:53):**  is an appetite within companies to pay farmers, not just talk about RegenAC, because there  
**[0:18:57-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:18:57):**  have been some great statements made by some very significant companies, but actually then  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:19:03):**  having capital flowing directly to those farmers for restoring those hectares.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:19:08):**  But with that proof of concept, we could then look at scale up funding.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:19:11):**  And actually, that's been the right thing to do, because as we although it does feel  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:19:15):**  like we're entering a long, hard winter, that said, it's kind of a bit to what you were  
**[0:19:21-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:19:21):**  saying earlier, what I observed is that the crisis, the current crisis really sharpened  
**[0:19:31-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:19:31):**  what people were all about.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:19:32):**  So those people really driven by impact, and with who had the capacity to do so, of course,  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:19:39):**  went deeper impact and said, nope, we need to stand stronger.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:19:43):**  We need to now is the time to step up.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:19:46):**  And I think that that sharpening is has been clarifying.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:19:53):**  So where are we now in we're at the end of November.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:19:55):**  So you mentioned these two groups, they both had a million committed, which both were put  
**[0:20:00-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:20:00):**  on hold.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:20:02):**  What would you say is a good snapshot of where the fundraising is now for that million to  
**[0:20:07-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:20:07):**  keep going and basically build the first show of product?  
**[0:20:11-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:20:11):**  Where do you feel you are?  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:20:12):**  Because you said sharpening doesn't mean there are more people involved now, or more  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:20:16):**  investors, more funders?  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:20:17):**  What has been the last month, basically on the fundraising side with that refocus of  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:20:22):**  raising 2 million from two funders, and then we can build a lot to we're raising 1 million  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:20:26):**  from potentially in a convertible loan from potentially a lot more people to build this  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:20:30):**  first product for 4000 hectares and 1 million to farmers?  
**[0:20:34-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:20:34):**  What has been the response to from both those two?  
**[0:20:37-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:20:37):**  I'm very curious, obviously, they were already committed, but then had to pause and others  
**[0:20:40-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:20:40):**  potentially that came on the table.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:20:42):**  Really striking one has postponed for down the road, and has said, as soon as things  
**[0:20:48-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:20:48):**  are flowing again, we will look at how we'll be able to step in.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:20:51):**  And we have a beautiful letter of support recommending us as partners and stating their  
**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:20:56):**  intention further down the line to work with us and join the Soul Heroes journey.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:21:02):**  So actually, it's a dream scenario, we have our pipeline ahead, we already have key stakeholders,  
**[0:21:09-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:21:09):**  who are lining up ready for the scale up round.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:21:16):**  So for the convertible loan, which is all great, obviously, if you get to the scale  
**[0:21:20-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:21:20):**  up, like you also need the money now, you need some of it now, you don't need all but  
**[0:21:23-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:21:23):**  enough to keep the fireplace going.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:21:25):**  Exactly.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:21:26):**  Otherwise, you never get to the scale.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:21:27):**  Yeah, so you then you need to be smart, and you need to be constantly listening and flexing  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:21:31):**  and zooming in, zooming out, you know, you have to move with the situation, if you're  
**[0:21:36-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:21:36):**  just completely going to stick to your guns and be stubborn, like this is how we're going  
**[0:21:40-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:21:40):**  to do it, then yeah, then it becomes very difficult and probably won't make it.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:21:44):**  So we've actually chosen to close around early, we're two thirds of the way there.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:21:51):**  And by doing so, we already have signing customers for Soul Heroes, so companies already onboarding  
**[0:21:58-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:21:58):**  and farmers onboarding, and we're introducing them and telling beautiful stories about how  
**[0:22:04-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:22:04):**  they are together creating change.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:22:07):**  And by doing so, so by closing around now, we are already changing the status of the  
**[0:22:14-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:22:14):**  company, we can immediately move into scale up funding.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:22:16):**  And that has, in the end, it will be interesting a year down the line to see if this holds  
**[0:22:21-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:22:21):**  true, but has done us a favour because there are a number of investors who are looking  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:22:27):**  at the scale up round for Soul Heroes because they generally prefer to invest larger amounts.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:22:33):**  And so the small convertible loan is not the most suitable for them, but they're very keen  
**[0:22:38-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:22:38):**  to step in further down the line.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:22:39):**  So in fact, if you look at the flow over the period of time, in fact, it makes sense and  
**[0:22:46-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:22:46):**  it works.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:22:47):**  It's just felt like a bit of a bumpy sideways ride to get there.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:22:51):**  So I'm extremely thrilled with the support that we have from our current round of investors  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:22:58):**  who already are looking ahead thinking about once we close this, what that means for the  
**[0:23:04-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:23:04):**  next round.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:23:06):**  Some of them have made reservations for the next round.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:23:09):**  So this isn't a short term thing.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:23:12):**  It's as I said earlier, it's a long journey, you're in it for the long game.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:23:17):**  And I think by that sharpening that we talked about, you find who really are your most aligned,  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:23:24):**  your true tribe, your dedicated team around you.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:23:29):**  And I really consider that the investors I work with, they're really an extension of  
**[0:23:33-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:23:33):**  our team.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:23:34):**  And then in fact, you become more efficient.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:23:39):**  You can go more direct and arguably faster because you have the right tribe around you.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:23:46):**  As a philosophical way of saying, it has been a pretty tough year and we've had to flex  
**[0:23:51-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:23:51):**  and change, but it's not been a bad thing in the end.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:23:54):**  And you've had you've raised capital, which I think for many, you said two thirds down  
**[0:23:59-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:23:59):**  the line, we can all do the calculation.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:24:01):**  You raised capital in a very challenging year for many.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:24:04):**  I think everybody had a bumpy ride.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:24:05):**  If you were going up or down, it doesn't really matter.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:24:08):**  It's been one of those years or actually not because nobody ever had a year like this,  
**[0:24:12-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:24:12):**  at least not in the say, like you said, the Western world.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:24:15):**  So what would you do different?  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:24:16):**  Like if you were going into like when that period where we look back at the year, et  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:24:20):**  cetera, if there's one thing you could do different, would you do anything first of  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:24:23):**  all differently or would you say I would do it exactly the same?  
**[0:24:26-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:24:26):**  This is how it was supposed to be.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:24:28):**  And if there was one thing, what would you do differently?  
**[0:24:30-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:24:30):**  One challenge that was brought to us, as you know, I'm not from an investment background  
**[0:24:34-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:24:34):**  and we chose to raise the three year budget, which was six point three million.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:24:42):**  And we chose to do that upfront because of the time it takes when you're a startup.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:24:47):**  That's also a very important point here.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:24:49):**  When you're a startup, who are you investing in?  
**[0:24:51-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:24:51):**  You're investing in an idea and you're investing in the team.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:24:55):**  So if you're investing in an idea and the entrepreneur, you're going to need a lot of  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:24:59):**  time with those people to really understand what their intentions are, to know that you  
**[0:25:05-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:25:05):**  can trust their competence, the way that they work, that you're going to enjoy.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:25:08):**  I mean, that's the other great thing about the investors around us.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:25:11):**  They're kind of really the ultimate definition of critical friends.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:25:15):**  They're really sharp and clear and challenging and they're also very supportive and nose  
**[0:25:21-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:25:21):**  aligned in the same direction.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:25:24):**  So those critical friends around us have given us that, have helped with the confidence.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:25:31):**  So there was some counterwind, let's say, that we were being too ambitious to raise  
**[0:25:38-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:25:38):**  all the money upfront.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:25:39):**  But as I say, you really want to protect the time of the entrepreneur at the same time  
**[0:25:43-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:25:43):**  as them being available for those investors who are essentially early stage, taking a  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:25:51):**  risk and there isn't just a product already that they can see and invest in.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:25:56):**  Yeah, you're saying like you have to spend so much time anyway, investor entrepreneur,  
**[0:26:01-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:26:01):**  like let's raise as much or let's raise quite a significant sum instead of just a few hundred  
**[0:26:05-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:26:05):**  thousand because the time is the same.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:26:08):**  And let's use that time with the entrepreneurs and the team as wisely as possible.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:26:12):**  Obviously making a bigger, I mean, if I remember correctly, it was connected to milestones.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:26:17):**  It wasn't all the six million in one shot.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:26:19):**  So it was obviously staged, but at least you invested the time upfront with the investor  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:26:24):**  and if he or she or them said yes, then you knew, OK, we've invested this for a three  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:26:29):**  year budget and for etc, etc, which in pandemic time might be a bit more challenging.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:26:34):**  Exactly.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:26:35):**  So I think people might expect my answer to be, well, the thing that I would change is  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:26:39):**  that I wouldn't have gone for the full amount and that instead we'd have started with more  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:26:43):**  classic style of a small amount, get a basic MVP, show the concept and then go back funding  
**[0:26:49-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:26:49):**  again and then do fundraising again.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:26:51):**  That would have been three rounds of fundraising.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:26:53):**  But that's not your answer.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:26:54):**  No, it's not.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:26:55):**  I've thought long and hard about this because obviously very keen constantly I'm always  
**[0:27:02-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:27:02):**  learning and seeking to learn.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:27:04):**  And I think being able to reflect critically on the steps so far are very important for  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:27:10):**  the steps you take further in the future at this kind of very delicate stage of being  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:27:14):**  emerging from startup and being a going concern.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:27:18):**  And no, I wouldn't I don't think I would change it.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:27:20):**  And the reasons are that it helped us by saying that was our ambition and it has helped us  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:27:28):**  to find the right people who believe in that ambition.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:27:33):**  And that's coming true because people are standing by us in spite of COVID and the movement  
**[0:27:38-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:27:38):**  has only grown.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:27:39):**  Our external network has only grown.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:27:42):**  It hasn't slowed down.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:27:45):**  And I believe that if you want to achieve big change, at some point you need that big  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:27:50):**  hairy goal at the start and it might not work out like that.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:27:55):**  Exactly.  
**[0:27:56-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:27:56):**  But yeah, but it's brought us the right people.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:27:58):**  You put a bar, you put a bar pretty high.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:28:00):**  And then during pandemic, as hopefully everybody, you were flexible what you could actually  
**[0:28:04-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:28:04):**  what it was actually on the table and you could take.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:28:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:28:07):**  And as a result of that, after just two years, as I say, we also have a very healthy potential  
**[0:28:14-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:28:14):**  pipeline already at play.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:28:16):**  So a lot of the hard work has been done now that I think will really make things hopefully  
**[0:28:23-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:28:23):**  flow easier in the future.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:28:25):**  So I think it's still been the right thing to do.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:28:28):**  And any tips, tips is always difficult, but any advice you would give to others that are  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:28:33):**  in a similar situation facing this crisis or facing another crisis?  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:28:37):**  I mean, for that matter, I mean, depending where you are, you have things more regularly  
**[0:28:41-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:28:41):**  that we were not so used to.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:28:44):**  What would be your main advice or tip to other people that are fundraising in challenging  
**[0:28:48-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:28:48):**  circumstances?  
**[0:28:49-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:28:49):**  Let's say number one, dialogue.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:28:51):**  Everything starts with dialogue.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:28:52):**  In the very first instance, don't be frightened to pick up the phone and have a very vulnerable,  
**[0:28:57-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:28:57):**  open discussion.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:29:00):**  If things are hard, it's important that you talk more and that you're really clear about  
**[0:29:06-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:29:06):**  where are the boundaries, what are the possibilities, how does this sit and understanding also short  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:29:12):**  term and long term, because things might be challenging right now, but that doesn't change  
**[0:29:17-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:29:17):**  somebody's purpose.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:29:19):**  And the worst thing you can do is, for example, let's say you've said, oh Gina, I could invest  
**[0:29:24-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:29:24):**  50,000 euros in your idea.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:29:26):**  And I say, wonderful, and then you say, I'm sorry, Gina, with COVID, it's not possible.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:29:30):**  It's not going to happen.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:29:31):**  Am I then going to stop talking to you and say, oh, well, Coon didn't put his money in,  
**[0:29:35-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:29:35):**  you know, it's not going to, of course not, because the connection that we have, the joint  
**[0:29:40-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:29:40):**  intention that we have, it's a very peculiar thing.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:29:43):**  But somebody once said to me, you don't look or sound like a fundraiser.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:29:47):**  And I was like, what?  
**[0:29:48-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:29:48):**  Not quite sure what you mean.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:29:49):**  Probably a good thing.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:29:50):**  Well, I took it as a good thing.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:29:51):**  And I certainly meant it as a good thing.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:29:55):**  And in the end, money is actually the last thing that you talk about.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:29:59):**  It's critical.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:30:00):**  And in the end, it's the point you have to sign a deal and you need to be able to pay  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:30:04):**  for the team and things need to be able to happen.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:30:07):**  But that's never the discussion.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:30:09):**  It's never around the funds themselves.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:30:12):**  It's actually about what are we going to do together.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:30:15):**  So my advice in a crisis is, although you might be feeling really pressured about how  
**[0:30:22-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:30:22):**  are you going to pay the next bills and how are you going to see through to the next months  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:30:26):**  or retain the talent that you have, at that moment in time, the most important thing you  
**[0:30:31-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:30:31):**  can do is rather than thinking about the funding per se, is to understand who are my pillars,  
**[0:30:37-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:30:37):**  who is my network, and how do we want to approach this together.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:30:42):**  I think a very important part for me is to be totally upfront as well.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:30:49):**  If you're having a tough time, being able to, so we've actually had this, speaking  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:30:53):**  with our founding funders, and we should briefly talk about that as well because it's a beautiful  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:30:58):**  example of going in for the six mil upfront.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:31:03):**  Actually through that, we found our founding funder and really they are the absolute core  
**[0:31:09-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:31:09):**  of everything we're doing.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:31:11):**  They provide stability and gravitas and understanding, confidence and empathy.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:31:19):**  Really tremendous.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:31:22):**  The moment that you think you're going to have a hard time, the best thing you can do  
**[0:31:25-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:31:25):**  is go back to those people.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:31:27):**  We shared with the founding funders, actually, we're not going to make it to the way that  
**[0:31:31-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:31:31):**  we thought we would.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:31:33):**  Thank you for your honesty.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:31:35):**  The feedback that we had from them was, there's two reasons, the concept and the team.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:31:42):**  The third reason that they invested is they know that when times are hard, they're going  
**[0:31:48-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:31:48):**  to know about it.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:31:49):**  When we're having problems, they're going to know about it.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:31:52):**  That creates a level of ability to do things in the future.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:31:55):**  Then you can really change things because you're being really upfront about the situation  
**[0:32:00-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:32:00):**  rather than putting your head in the sand or being sunk by the enormity of the challenge.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:32:06):**  Being authentic and being open and being honest.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:32:09):**  What was very lovely is they came back and explained, actually, if we could, we would  
**[0:32:15-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:32:15):**  help you on your running rate.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:32:17):**  Really, it's never even crossed our mind to come back to you because you've already done  
**[0:32:21-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:32:21):**  your job.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:32:22):**  You funded a third of the budget.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:32:23):**  We never intended this to be one set of investors coming in.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:32:28):**  It's very important for the longevity of what we're doing and our impact to have the right  
**[0:32:33-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:32:33):**  people on board.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:32:34):**  It's never just one person or one family.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:32:39):**  To be honest, it's very simple and very plain advice.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:32:41):**  I think you just need to breathe, believe in what you're doing.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:32:47):**  Talk and listen.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:32:48):**  Talk, listen, be open and not hold on too tight.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:32:55):**  I don't know if you know what I mean by that.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:32:58):**  Sometimes being able to let go just a little bit and be on the scary roller coaster.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:33:05):**  If you've built good foundations, you're going to come through it the right way somehow.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:33:09):**  Trust.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:33:10):**  In the end, it comes down to.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:33:15):**  I think it's excellent advice.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:33:17):**  I want to take that as a bridge to shift gears a bit and ask you.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:33:20):**  I know you keep saying, I don't have the investor background.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:33:23):**  I come from the philanthropic fundraising world, but you also are used to quite large  
**[0:33:28-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:33:28):**  amounts.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:33:29):**  I'm very interested in what if you would be an investor yourself and you would actually  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:33:33):**  have the portfolio of a nice amount, let's say one billion to invest.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:33:38):**  What would you, I'm assuming regenerative back end food, but you could also invest somewhere  
**[0:33:42-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:33:42):**  else.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:33:43):**  What would you focus on?  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:33:44):**  What would be your prioritization in terms of if you had to put a bill into work?  
**[0:33:48-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:33:48):**  Well, I should check first.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:33:49):**  Are you sure it's still only a billion?  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:33:50):**  Because I believe you've asked this question a few times, so maybe somewhere that amount  
**[0:33:54-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:33:54):**  is increased.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:33:55):**  I usually ask a billion, but if you want 10 as well, I'm curious about how you prioritize  
**[0:34:01-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:34:01):**  because you've worked with large amounts, let's say.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:34:03):**  So if it makes you more comfortable, I can also add a few zeros.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:34:06):**  But I'm interested, what would you invest it in in terms of categories?  
**[0:34:10-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:34:10):**  What would you focus on?  
**[0:34:11-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:34:11):**  What do you think are the most important pieces at the moment in regenerative back end food?  
**[0:34:15-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:34:15):**  This is a different way of asking the same question, obviously.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:34:17):**  Totally agree.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:34:18):**  It's about the prioritization rather than the amount.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:34:22):**  I don't know how we would implement it, but I would love to throw a ton of money at retraining  
**[0:34:27-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:34:27):**  agronomists so that no matter for whom they work, their foundation, their basis has been  
**[0:34:34-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:34:34):**  in farming with nature.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:34:36):**  Because once it's in your system, it doesn't go away.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:34:40):**  Once the scales fall from your eyes, there's no going back, as I said earlier, for myself,  
**[0:34:43-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:34:43):**  for my own personal journey.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:34:44):**  And you see it with farmers.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:34:45):**  All farmers want to do good by their land.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:34:48):**  It's just they might not necessarily have the right tools or the right space, actually.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:34:53):**  They might even have the knowledge, but the right space.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:34:55):**  So in the first instance, I would love to, and those agronomists, to actually first spend  
**[0:35:00-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:35:00):**  some time with small scale holders who are already farming in very regenerative ways  
**[0:35:05-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:35:05):**  in, say, the global south, where we completely turn things on their head.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:35:11):**  Instead of what can we bring to them, we say, actually, what can we learn?  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:35:16):**  And we start to bring the world more into a central place of understanding rather than  
**[0:35:21-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:35:21):**  this divide of kind of where the knowledge is and how we have to transfer it.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:35:25):**  So bringing agronomists to the global side, I think that's to basically sit down, listen  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:35:30):**  and learn from smallholder farmers who are applying agroecology, regenerative farming,  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:35:35):**  whatever you want to call it, and think, like, hopefully plant a seed that they will bring  
**[0:35:40-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:35:40):**  back when they go to their enormous farms they're advising in Australia, Europe, the  
**[0:35:44-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:35:44):**  US, etc.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:35:45):**  And your hunch is that that seed won't go away anymore.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:35:49):**  Like once you've seen what's possible, even if you work for the big chemical companies,  
**[0:35:53-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:35:53):**  you will figure out ways to not work for the big chemical companies anymore and work with  
**[0:35:57-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:35:57):**  your farmers that actually that's supposed to be your client.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:36:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:36:01):**  And of course, the key question is, what are the return expectations of the fund?  
**[0:36:04-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:36:04):**  That's yours to decide.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:36:05):**  Could be zero, could be partly super high, super low.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:36:08):**  I mean, you can build a portfolio.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:36:10):**  Well, so I would love to, I don't have the expertise myself, but there are definitely  
**[0:36:16-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:36:16):**  movers and shakers already.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:36:18):**  For this amount, you can get a team.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:36:19):**  I mean, for this amount, you can get a team in place, don't worry.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:36:22):**  There are people already thinking about it.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:36:23):**  And I would say in the very first instance, the fund would not report impact based on  
**[0:36:29-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:36:29):**  euros returned.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:36:31):**  It would report impact based on nature restored.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:36:34):**  So and leave it as its own value rather than trying to translate that into monetary value.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:36:40):**  Why is that?  
**[0:36:41-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:36:41):**  I completely agree.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:36:42):**  I don't like the constant everything has to be a dollar thinking, but I know a lot of  
**[0:36:46-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:36:46):**  people do.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:36:48):**  What's you said at the beginning, so at some point that changes or you want to keep it  
**[0:36:52-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:36:52):**  that way for as long as the fund lives?  
**[0:36:55-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:36:55):**  No, I think I would leave it that way.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:36:57):**  And the of course key thing there is then how would you measure that?  
**[0:37:01-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:37:01):**  As of course goes without saying investing in an organization like Soul Heroes would  
**[0:37:05-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:37:05):**  be an obvious thing to do and be able to scale that.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:37:09):**  I think as long as it can be measured, then you're actually incentivizing in the right  
**[0:37:15-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:37:15):**  way.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:37:16):**  You're not incentivizing for profit, you're incentivizing for purpose.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:37:18):**  And then how do you then link that to increase the value in the value chain?  
**[0:37:24-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:37:24):**  So if there was a way that we could also underwrite and I don't know how we would do this, but  
**[0:37:30-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:37:30):**  underwrite the profit margins, a percentage of the profit margins for companies that are  
**[0:37:38-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:37:38):**  prepared to account for their investment in nature in a different way.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:37:42):**  And that are also willing to transform their supply chains really like not just saying,  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:37:49):**  yes, we're going to do it and we'll do pilots, but actually stop immediately with all chemicals  
**[0:37:54-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:37:54):**  other than the ones that farmers need in order to get their soils off the chemicals that  
**[0:38:00-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:38:00):**  they're addicted to.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:38:01):**  So there's a certain transition period, but in the end, we need dramatic change.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:38:07):**  And I just, I feel like we are still working within the bounds of what we know.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:38:13):**  And there are some very interesting networks and thinkers at the moment looking at financial  
**[0:38:18-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:38:18):**  levers for change, looking at agro pivot points of how you can do things differently.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:38:26):**  And I think if with a fund that you could literally just rewrite the rules, then I would  
**[0:38:31-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:38:31):**  get the best team.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:38:32):**  I would also find the most hardcore, critical, purely focused on profit investors to work  
**[0:38:39-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:38:39):**  also with us so that we can really understand the headwind that we're going into and be  
**[0:38:46-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:38:46):**  able to figure out the answers to all of their fears, concerns, and questions.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:38:51):**  And the most obvious thing would be to have as much of that money as possible going to  
**[0:38:55-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:38:55):**  farmers to make the transition.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:38:58):**  So for example, why not invest in a kickass marketing team that can help farmers on how  
**[0:39:06-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:39:06):**  they talk about what they do?  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:39:08):**  Because no farmers go at the time to go, you know, even just me getting technically set  
**[0:39:13-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:39:13):**  up to speak to you, okay?  
**[0:39:15-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:39:15):**  A farmer, are they going to have the time to go and have a professional photo shoot  
**[0:39:18-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:39:18):**  and learn how to tell their story and work out what they're going, you know, and also  
**[0:39:23-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:39:23):**  it's very personal and it's about yourself.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:39:25):**  So that's not a very easy thing to do.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:39:28):**  Whereas I do believe that if we could have more visibility of farmers stories of what  
**[0:39:33-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:39:33):**  the reality is of when someone walks into a shop and they pay the price of a banana,  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:39:39):**  that they actually understand what it took to grow it and the faces behind the food that  
**[0:39:44-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:39:44):**  we are eating.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:39:45):**  It will be like a communication agency purely focused on telling the real story of farmers  
**[0:39:52-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:39:52):**  or the extensive, holistic, not long form, not just the face on the package and three  
**[0:39:56-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:39:56):**  lines because there's a lot more behind that, which we never know.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:40:01):**  We don't know about our coffees.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:40:02):**  We don't know about our potatoes.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:40:03):**  We don't know about our onions.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:40:04):**  We have no clue about our grain and we have no clue about our milk or animal protein,  
**[0:40:08-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:40:08):**  et cetera.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:40:09):**  And obviously also not about our bananas.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:40:10):**  Like there's the whole, unless you go out and actually spend time, I think I would argue  
**[0:40:15-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:40:15):**  most people don't really know what it takes to grow that regeneratively or non regeneratively.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:40:19):**  Like in general, we don't know the challenges.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:40:22):**  I think there's a huge, there are a lot of stories to be told there.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:40:25):**  There are a lot of stories to be told and the question is how do stories make money?  
**[0:40:28-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:40:28):**  Well actually some of the best companies in the world, they make their money in the end  
**[0:40:32-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:40:32):**  by telling stories.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:40:33):**  And of course an example, you know, is always close to our heart because the first funding  
**[0:40:38-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:40:38):**  into the Soul Heroes Foundation, Patagonia, there's no one who can tell a story like Patagonia  
**[0:40:43-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:40:43):**  does and they say, don't buy a jacket.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:40:45):**  And of course for them profit wise, everybody then goes and buys a jacket.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:40:50):**  Point being that when they tell their stories, people pay attention and they listen and actually  
**[0:40:56-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:40:56):**  people move with, they vote with their feet.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:40:58):**  They will come to a company because they know they're sourcing better cotton and they are  
**[0:41:03-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:41:03):**  actually treating all their employees fairly.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:41:05):**  And they're building the communities around where that cotton is grown and ensuring its  
**[0:41:09-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:41:09):**  full access to all of society.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:41:12):**  So I think discrimination within, there's not much talk is starting, but the discrimination  
**[0:41:19-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:41:19):**  that occurs even within the food supply chain, I think if there's a way of addressing that,  
**[0:41:24-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:41:24):**  how do you then relate that back to profit?  
**[0:41:26-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:41:26):**  Well in the end, if it means that farmers are going to build the resilience of their  
**[0:41:32-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:41:32):**  soils and therefore they don't need to irrigate as much and we've seen it with the Klomper  
**[0:41:39-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:41:39):**  farm, the difference that it makes once you're really farming with nature, your inputs go  
**[0:41:43-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:41:43):**  down.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:41:45):**  Farmers are going to be more viable, which means their children are not going to leave  
**[0:41:50-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:41:50):**  the countryside as quickly.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:41:51):**  They may be more likely to take on those farms.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:41:54):**  Or they come back.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:41:55):**  They come back.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:41:56):**  Now that we've seen those examples, I mean, people keep asking like, is it more profitable?  
**[0:42:00-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:42:00):**  I think if you dig down, it definitely can be or quality of life is much better or both,  
**[0:42:06-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:42:06):**  but they're definitely not less profitable.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:42:08):**  I think that's the general, it really depends where you are in your transition, but there's  
**[0:42:11-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:42:11):**  some very successful examples, small, large on any continent that have made or are in  
**[0:42:18-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:42:18):**  the middle of a transition and are seeing huge payoffs in all impacts they can imagine  
**[0:42:22-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:42:22):**  from biodiversity to yield to family time, quality time, et cetera.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:42:27):**  And if you can measure that in a really holistic way.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:42:30):**  So impact meaning not just impact on soil health and impact financially, but impact  
**[0:42:35-0:42:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:42:35):**  on the experience of people working on the farm, impact on the family, as you say, I  
**[0:42:41-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:42:41):**  think impact really through all of the different lenses.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:42:45):**  I think we heard it a number of times, like it's fun again.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:42:47):**  How are you going to measure it?  
**[0:42:48-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:42:48):**  It never comes back in an impact report.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:42:50):**  But I've heard many farmers say this is actually, it's fun again.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:42:53):**  Like this is inventing things.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:42:55):**  This is figuring out what works on my, on our land.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:42:57):**  This is going back in old history books and see what they did before combining that with  
**[0:43:02-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:43:02):**  the new tech, figuring out new tech, buying the latest drones.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:43:05):**  Like this is fun again, compared to many times conventional farming is a lot of stress and  
**[0:43:10-0:43:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:43:10):**  not very fun.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:43:11):**  Yeah, it's putting the joy back in farming and also being proud.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:43:15):**  And I think the community component is very underestimated.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:43:18):**  You know, the psychological aspect.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:43:21):**  Okay.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:43:22):**  It's naturally a lonely experience and perhaps may not always be the most extrovert wanting  
**[0:43:29-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:43:29):**  to connect with everybody, but to know that people are admiring and loving what you're  
**[0:43:34-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:43:34):**  doing and to know that you can see other people who are doing the same and not feel like you're  
**[0:43:39-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:43:39):**  so strange in the way that you've got this very messy looking field.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:43:43):**  Yeah, the weirdo.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:43:44):**  You have to have it behind the farm only and on the front side, you know, stories of farmers  
**[0:43:49-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:43:49):**  in Western Australia who'd been busy with with farm permaculture for a long time.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:43:54):**  And at the front, they had their bland monocrop fields and behind their houses, they had all  
**[0:43:59-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:43:59):**  these beautiful, very diverse.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:44:02):**  No, no, it's something we underestimate very easily because if you live in a relatively  
**[0:44:06-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:44:06):**  small town with a strict social, not control, but it's very difficult to be different.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:44:12):**  And if you have messy fields, many people look at that and look at you weirdly.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:44:15):**  And we've heard stories from people switching to organic in the US and their children were  
**[0:44:19-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:44:19):**  no longer invited for soccer practice, or were no longer picked for the team.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:44:23):**  And that was for organic wasn't even the messy regenerative transition some people go through  
**[0:44:27-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:44:27):**  or SLM.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:44:28):**  I keep telling that story.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:44:29):**  When they started in Australia, they were called stupid land management because the  
**[0:44:33-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:44:33):**  neighbors were all looking at them like, oh, this is going to fail for sure.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:44:36):**  And luckily, they came from the outside.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:44:38):**  And of course, they and they proved a lot of things.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:44:40):**  But the first years, their operators and their their farmers were looked upon really, really  
**[0:44:44-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:44:44):**  weirdly.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:44:45):**  And so it's huge pressure thing, which is interesting.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:44:48):**  And something we need to the story piece is crucial there.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:44:51):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:44:52):**  And so and then just closing off on the fund, I think the business model then being and  
**[0:44:58-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:44:58):**  you know, I've learned a lot of this through, of course, working with the clumpers in the  
**[0:45:02-0:45:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:45:02):**  end, if you're then improving by improving soil health, whichever way you do it, because  
**[0:45:08-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:45:08):**  there's so many different means, as I say, you know, whether it's encouraging them up  
**[0:45:11-0:45:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:45:11):**  farmer to be able to share their story.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:45:14):**  And therefore they are encouraged and they're incentivized, whether it's through being rewarded  
**[0:45:18-0:45:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:45:18):**  for the I don't like the word ecosystem services, the greatness that it gives us from nature.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:45:26):**  When you put nature back into the field, let's put it that way, whether it's paying them  
**[0:45:30-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:45:30):**  for that, or whether it's retraining the agronomist, regardless, their asset, their farmland, their  
**[0:45:39-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:45:39):**  home, their business is going to increase in value, because there is more resilience.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:45:44):**  And it will, in the end, be growing more reliably and better crops than degraded land.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:45:53):**  And if there's a way that we can measure that, then I think you can start to talk about how  
**[0:45:57-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:45:57):**  you give your reward back to the fund.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:46:00):**  So it's not my area of expertise, but I would definitely come with the  
**[0:46:06-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:46:06):**  That's why I asked the question, because otherwise it would be very boring.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:46:09):**  I'd get a really expert person to work with my crazy ideas and where I'm very focused  
**[0:46:14-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:46:14):**  on mission and purpose.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:46:15):**  That's how many funds start, don't worry.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:46:18):**  And as a final question, because I want to be conscious of your time as well, I usually  
**[0:46:22-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:46:22):**  ask a final question and then others follow.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:46:24):**  So we take away the fund, but you have a magic power, you have a magic wand, and you can  
**[0:46:28-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:46:28):**  change one thing in the food and ag space.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:46:30):**  What would that be?  
**[0:46:31-0:46:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:46:31):**  I'm not allowed two things.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:46:32):**  You're not allowed one thing and then changing it to two.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:46:36):**  It's not allowed.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:46:37):**  So then I would be torn between either literally not a single person is allowed to walk down  
**[0:46:44-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:46:44):**  the path of a farmer's home that isn't promoting nature in the way that they are growing what  
**[0:46:52-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:46:52):**  we rely on.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:46:53):**  Use, eat, burn.  
**[0:46:55-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:46:55):**  That's one.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:46:57):**  And the other would be that every single time someone picks anything up off the shelves  
**[0:47:04-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:47:04):**  of a supermarket, there's immediate transparency and they understand what they are purchasing.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:47:12):**  So as a mother of young children, I hate it that I actually don't know, is this really  
**[0:47:20-0:47:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:47:20):**  good for my child or not?  
**[0:47:23-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:47:23):**  And am I feeding them in the end something that actually is bringing?  
**[0:47:28-0:47:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:47:28):**  Because what you put into the ground in the end is what you're putting into your own body.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:47:32):**  It's that simple.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:47:33):**  We've made it enormously complicated and we've made it very sophisticated and the whole world  
**[0:47:41-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:47:41):**  global food system is extremely opaque.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:47:45):**  And in the end, it's extremely simple.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:47:48):**  What you feed the grass, kind of what was put to me by someone is what does the plant  
**[0:47:54-0:47:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:47:54):**  eat?  
**[0:47:55-0:48:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:47:55):**  So what you give the plant to eat and what the soil eats in the end is what you're going  
**[0:48:00-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:48:00):**  to eat.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:48:01):**  So I think a level of transparency that means also consumers make more consider choices  
**[0:48:07-0:48:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:48:07):**  so that it's not a price game.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:48:10):**  Because in the end, of course, if something is a bit cheaper on the shelf and you're managing  
**[0:48:14-0:48:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:48:14):**  a budget, you're going to be weighing up, okay, well, in the end, it's about price,  
**[0:48:19-0:48:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:48:19):**  not about taste, not about nutrition.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:48:21):**  So I think a magic wand across kind of all of the shelves in a supermarket that somehow  
**[0:48:27-0:48:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:48:27):**  gives you that spotlight of, oh, this is bloody tasty, it's really good for you and it's not  
**[0:48:32-0:48:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:48:32):**  ridiculously more expensive.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:48:33):**  Oh, I'll take that instead.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:48:34):**  I think it's a good way to close this interview.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:48:37):**  Thank you, Gina, so much for sharing in this weird year, the end of a weird year.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:48:43):**  We're almost at the end, actually.

**[0:50:44-0:50:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:50:44):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:50:48-0:50:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:50:48):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011

**[0:51:38-0:51:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:51:38):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office

**[0:51:53-0:51:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:51:53):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:51:55-0:51:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:51:55):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:51:59):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:52:04-0:52:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:52:04):**  different means.

**[0:52:10-0:52:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:52:10):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.

**[0:52:14-0:52:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:52:14):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:52:15-0:52:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:52:15):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:52:21-0:52:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:52:21):**  so you don't have to write along.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:52:23):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:52:28-0:52:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:52:28):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:52:34-0:52:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:52:34):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:52:38-0:52:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:52:38):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:52:40):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:52:45-0:52:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:52:45):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:52:49):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:52:53):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:52:54-0:52:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:52:54):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:52:56-0:52:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:52:56):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:52:59):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:53:03):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:53:05-0:53:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2021/01/05/gina-pattinson#t=0:53:05):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

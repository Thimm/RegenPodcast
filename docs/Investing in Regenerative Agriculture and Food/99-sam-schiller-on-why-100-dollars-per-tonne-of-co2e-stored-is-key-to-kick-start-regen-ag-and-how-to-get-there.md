**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:00:13):**  Why we should pay at least $100 a ton of carbon stored by farmers in their soil and how our  
**[0:00:18-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:00:18):**  guest of today is planning to make that possible.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:00:21):**  Plus why current soil carbon models greatly underestimate the potential of region ag and  
**[0:00:25-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:00:25):**  what to do about it.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:00:27):**  It's time to update the science and start paying some people might say a crazy amount  
**[0:00:31-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:00:31):**  for every ton they store.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:00:34):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the  
**[0:00:39-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:00:39):**  planet mattered.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:00:40):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:00:44):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:00:50):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:00:54):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:00:56):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:00-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:01:00):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:01:03):**  And it's time that we as investors big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:01:08):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:01:12):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:16-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:01:16):**  our work.

**[0:01:36-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:01:36):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:01:38):**  Welcome to another episode today with Sam Schiller, founder and CEO of Carbon Yield.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:01:42):**  They help farmers access new revenue streams in the carbon markets and much more.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:01:47):**  Welcome Sam.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:01:48):**  Thanks so much.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:01:49):**  Great to be here.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:01:50):**  So as always the personal question, why did you end up working in region X soil and basically  
**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:01:57):**  going deep pun intended on the carbon markets, soil carbon and everything that comes around  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:02:03):**  to that?  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:02:04):**  Sure.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:02:05):**  Well, the 10 years prior to starting Carbon Yield, I spent collaborating in rural communities  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:02:09):**  on environmental projects and often found myself forming deep partnerships with farmers  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:02:14):**  and rural landowners who were often deeply skeptical that environmental markets would  
**[0:02:19-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:02:19):**  actually deliver them much value.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:02:21):**  Oftentimes for really great reason.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:02:23):**  And so I developed wind energy projects and had to really figure out how to cast environmental  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:02:28):**  opportunities and wind energy as another crop and looking at it relative to other opportunities  
**[0:02:33-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:02:33):**  on the landscape.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:02:34):**  I developed projects, carbon offset projects in coal mine methane sector, where we looked  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:02:39):**  at landowners that were living on top of coal mines and figuring out how to handle some  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:02:43):**  of the pollution that came from those mines and to deliver value back to those landowners  
**[0:02:47-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:02:47):**  for handling that pollution.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:02:49):**  And similarly in the refrigeration industry, we developed projects that destroyed CFC refrigerants,  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:02:54):**  basically the most egregious substances we've ever produced in terms of their climate impact  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:02:59):**  and figured out how carbon markets could add more value to a refrigerant business than  
**[0:03:04-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:03:04):**  kind of business as usual.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:03:05):**  So I've always found myself in these kinds of translator roles of looking at market opportunities  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:03:11):**  and being very mission focused on creating climate impact, but showing up on the ground,  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:03:15):**  figuring out what people need and really trying to make those markets work for folks.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:03:20):**  And so I spent about 10 years building a great company and scaling that company.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:03:25):**  And my wife was at the time studying abroad in London.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:03:28):**  And so I was shuffling back and forth looking for the next project ahead of me and Tradewater,  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:03:34):**  my former company, was able to continue growing without me.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:03:36):**  So I got a chance to step back and be a house husband and really think about where else  
**[0:03:41-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:03:41):**  could I have an impact?  
**[0:03:42-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:03:42):**  Where did my experiences in rural communities?  
**[0:03:45-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:03:45):**  Where could that be beneficial?  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:03:46):**  Where were there opportunities that weren't happening that held really great climate potential?  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:03:51):**  And so you can imagine me cooking recipes, cookbook listening to podcasts like this and  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:03:56):**  others riding my bike on the wrong side of the street in London and thinking about where  
**[0:04:00-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:04:00):**  was there an opportunity that where this kind of translator role could be really useful  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:04:04):**  where carbon markets might be able to enable massive climate action.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:04:08):**  And I soon really stumbled on soil as this really unique opportunity.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:04:13):**  I often say that if you told some venture capitalist that there was this new technology  
**[0:04:18-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:04:18):**  that used microbes and used fungi and leveraged solar power to create edible food to potentially  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:04:27):**  sequester a quarter to a half of our annual emissions and to make us much more resilient  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:04:31):**  and healthy, it would attract billions and billions of dollars.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:04:34):**  But the moment you say it's actually already exists, we don't have to invent any technology  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:04:38):**  it's soil, the checkbook closes.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:04:42):**  So you know, soil is I've always had this kind of bias towards existing technologies.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:04:48):**  I think we have a lot of the skills that we need and that you learn a lot through deploying,  
**[0:04:52-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:04:52):**  through actually trying to make something happen on the ground and thought soil was  
**[0:04:55-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:04:55):**  a really unique opportunity.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:04:56):**  And frankly, I feel like the boundaries between urban and rural communities, particularly  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:05:01):**  in the United States, represent one of the most fundamental boundaries and differences  
**[0:05:06-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:05:06):**  in our country.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:05:07):**  And it's a political divide, it is a cultural divide, and we need to be able to traverse  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:05:11):**  it, and we need to figure out how to collaborate together and to create a meaningful value  
**[0:05:15-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:05:15):**  because farmers in this country and all over the world are really struggling.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:05:18):**  And if you can create deeper connections, I think between consumers, between urban customers  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:05:23):**  and rural food producers, I think you can solve a lot of problems simultaneously.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:05:28):**  So I started Carbon Yield kind of while I was abroad in London, I did some work with  
**[0:05:33-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:05:33):**  an organic food distributor, Pipeline Food.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:05:35):**  So I know it's been on the podcast to look at whether carbon markets could be beneficial  
**[0:05:41-0:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:05:41):**  to farmers, particularly farmers transitioning to organic.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:05:44):**  And the basis of this was that the only durable environmental compensation that farmers have  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:05:50):**  been able to get are from the organic label, that you can go from being an operation that's  
**[0:05:55-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:05:55):**  losing money, half of farms since 2013 in this country have lost money every year since  
**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:06:02):**  2013.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:06:04):**  And after a three-year transition, you can become an organic farm and make a substantial  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:06:08):**  amount of money, make two or three hundred dollars in profit per acre per year.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:06:12):**  But the transition is really difficult.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:06:15):**  Its owner, it costs four hundred dollars upfront per acre to be able to make that transition.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:06:20):**  And we want to figure out, is there a way that carbon markets could actually subsidize  
**[0:06:24-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:06:24):**  that transition, whether that's unlocking transition loans and finance or whether that  
**[0:06:28-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:06:28):**  is actually providing revenue, which I think often is even more meaningful to farmers than  
**[0:06:32-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:06:32):**  taking on more debt.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:06:33):**  So did some consulting work at Pipeline to kind of think that through and realize that  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:06:37):**  there may actually be a business here and form some partnerships and some project development  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:06:41):**  activities that kind of had furthered that goal of really making carbon markets and carbon  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:06:46):**  revenue a more meaningful value stream that can help farmers transition to a sustaining  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:06:51):**  operation to be able to be prosperous into the future, to be able to stay on the land,  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:06:55):**  to leave a legacy of environmental stewardship on their land, and ultimately to continue  
**[0:07:00-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:07:00):**  feeding us a very healthy food on healthy soil.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:07:03):**  That's a very interesting, interesting journey.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:07:05):**  So Carbon Yield, we connected, I think, a year ago or a bit less than a year ago.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:07:10):**  And a lot has happened in, first of all, the carbon markets.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:07:15):**  A lot has happened in Region Ag and Food.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:07:17):**  But can you describe now we're talking the end of November 2020, like where you're at  
**[0:07:23-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:07:23):**  with Carbon Yield?  
**[0:07:24-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:07:24):**  What are you busy with?  
**[0:07:25-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:07:25):**  What are after the consultancy you have done with Pipeline Food?  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:07:28):**  What are you busy with at the moment in terms of carbon markets for Region Ag and Food?  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:07:32):**  One of our primary partnerships right now is with Hudson Carbon, which is a research  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:07:37):**  institution that's situated on a 2,000-acre regenerative organic farm in the Hudson Valley  
**[0:07:41-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:07:41):**  of New York.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:07:43):**  And they have, in my mind, probably the most rigorous, substantial research operation on  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:07:49):**  examining a farm that's gone fully through the transition.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:07:52):**  Whole hog, not field by field, not bit by bit, test plot by test plot.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:07:56):**  But they said, we're going to take a conventional corn-soy chemical rotation and turn it into  
**[0:08:02-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:08:02):**  a super regenerative cover cropping, perennials, animal integration, compost, the ground cover,  
**[0:08:09-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:08:09):**  all of the check marks and more.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:08:12):**  They do key line design.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:08:13):**  They really have implemented kind of whole hog, this incredible operation.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:08:18):**  And then they've taken soil cores and eddy flux tower measurements and biomass measurements  
**[0:08:23-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:08:23):**  and done the really comprehensive research.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:08:26):**  What's the tower measurement?  
**[0:08:27-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:08:27):**  I didn't get that part.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:08:28):**  Eddy flux covariance towers.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:08:30):**  So these measure greenhouse gas flux.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:08:34):**  They look at carbon, they look at methane and nitrogen, and they're able to see minute  
**[0:08:39-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:08:39):**  by minute.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:08:40):**  Basically, how it's breathing.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:08:41):**  Is it a sort of, just to make it visual because we're on audio, how should I imagine that  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:08:45):**  research happening or that piece happening?  
**[0:08:47-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:08:47):**  It's in the middle of the field.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:08:49):**  They have a little bit of the crop sort of down so that there's enough space for this  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:08:54):**  probably like six-foot high piece of instrumentation.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:08:59):**  It's got a weather station on it so we can tell that there's precipitation, temperature,  
**[0:09:04-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:09:04):**  and it's just a little sensor with a little solar powered pack giving it power every day.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:09:10):**  And yeah, it's collecting all this data.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:09:12):**  And this is not the kind of data that most farmers would be able to collect on their  
**[0:09:16-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:09:16):**  own.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:09:17):**  I mean, these are 60, $70,000 pieces of equipment.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:09:19):**  This is really for the benefit of soil science and hopefully to carbon markets.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:09:23):**  And I think one of our key insights from working in the sector is that some of the science  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:09:29):**  has not made it into carbon market infrastructure.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:09:32):**  What do you mean by that?  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:09:34):**  So I think that because a lot of folks in carbon markets have wanted to get going quickly,  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:09:39):**  they've wanted to use models, they've wanted to use tools that were widely available.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:09:44):**  But some of those use 30-year-old science and use data sets that are not really comparable  
**[0:09:50-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:09:50):**  to what is going on in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:09:52):**  So you're saying like this farm that is definitely on the cutting edge or applying all approaches  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:09:57):**  you can possibly imagine in the Upper Hudson Valley is potentially a better data set with  
**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:10:02):**  all the science around it because you have or they have the budget to buy these towers  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:10:06):**  and to do all of this will give you a much more accurate potential in this case of carbon,  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:10:12):**  potentially methane, but let's say carbon, then a lot of the models a lot of people have  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:10:16):**  used like comment like others that are underpinning a lot of these markets like we need an update  
**[0:10:20-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:10:20):**  of the data because some of this stuff is 30 years old.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:10:23):**  That's correct.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:10:24):**  Which a lot of the regenerative approaches weren't scaled yet or weren't at least not  
**[0:10:28-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:10:28):**  mixed together as we see now in this case at Hudson Carbon.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:10:31):**  Correct.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:10:32):**  And you know, it's not to say that the comment is a bad model because I think it does a really  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:10:34):**  good job of modeling a lot of conventional approaches to agriculture.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:10:39):**  But a lot of the input data for comment only reaches 10 centimeters into the ground.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:10:43):**  And so that works when you're looking at chemical applications and looking at immature root  
**[0:10:49-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:10:49):**  systems from corn and soy conventional operations.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:10:52):**  But when you're a regenerative farm and you might be planning a few years of perennials  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:10:56):**  that are driving root systems a meter into the ground, that you're missing 10x of the  
**[0:11:01-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:11:01):**  soil profile where changes are happening.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:11:04):**  And in fact, what's really interesting is that through this research, they found that  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:11:08):**  a lot of biological activity is happening in those deeper layers and it's below the  
**[0:11:12-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:11:12):**  reach of tillage implements.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:11:13):**  So often the criticism of soil, carbon and one of the criticisms of carbon projects in  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:11:19):**  agriculture is that there's a permanence challenge.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:11:22):**  You know, if you till up the ground, you're losing all the biological benefit that you've  
**[0:11:26-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:11:26):**  created.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:11:27):**  But what they found is that a lot of that biological activity that penetrated below  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:11:30):**  the reach of tillage implements has been increasing faster than some of the gains in shallower  
**[0:11:35-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:11:35):**  layers.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:11:36):**  And that's really interesting and potentially game changing in the sector because the rates  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:11:40):**  that they're calculating on their farms in some cases are three, four or five times of  
**[0:11:44-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:11:44):**  common farm and others.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:11:46):**  So what are the rates we're talking about?  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:11:48):**  Just to get an understanding in terms of what is a ton per hectare or ton per acre, obviously.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:11:53):**  And what is the difference?  
**[0:11:54-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:11:54):**  I mean, three to five X is a lot.  
**[0:11:56-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:11:56):**  What are they seeing?  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:11:58):**  Farm wide, they've seen a rate of, I believe it is seven tons per acre on their farm.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:12:02):**  They have some fields that are per year, per year.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:12:05):**  So over the five years of their research project, some fields have had a higher rate, have had  
**[0:12:10-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:12:10):**  10, 11 tons per acre.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:12:12):**  You know, obviously some of this has a confidence interval that you can, you should apply and  
**[0:12:16-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:12:16):**  this should be replicated elsewhere.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:12:17):**  This is not published yet, but there's really good evidence that relative to Comet, which  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:12:22):**  says that they might in some fields be losing carbon, you know, might have half a ton per  
**[0:12:26-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:12:26):**  acre.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:12:27):**  They're getting quite a more substantial impact and result.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:12:31):**  And Comet is what is used by most carbon markets to compensate farmers for the benefits that  
**[0:12:36-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:12:36):**  they're creating.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:12:37):**  So if this is the case for most regenerative farms that they're getting undercompensated  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:12:42):**  for the benefits they're creating, it's no wonder that carbon markets have not really  
**[0:12:46-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:12:46):**  enticed widespread change.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:12:48):**  And our goal as project developers.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:12:51):**  So what are you doing about it?  
**[0:12:52-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:12:52):**  Now you know, you cannot unknow.  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:12:55):**  What's your plan of action to either update, I mean, or maybe all of it above, but update  
**[0:13:00-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:13:00):**  Comet, launch other versions of it, or what's the action plan to get farmers that are underpaid  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:13:06):**  for the carbon they're storing, get them paid?  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:13:10):**  So we have a couple ideas on this.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:13:13):**  One of which is we're developing a project through Nori and Nori has created this really  
**[0:13:18-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:13:18):**  great invitation to farmers that have.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:13:20):**  Yeah, we interviewed Paul a while back.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:13:22):**  I will link the interview below in the show notes.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:13:25):**  Oh, fabulous.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:13:26):**  So they have said, we also agree that the models are imprecise and we were using what's  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:13:32):**  available to us, but if farmers have better data sets, they're welcome to contribute them  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:13:36):**  and that can factor into the carbon credit quantification for a project.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:13:41):**  So that seemed like a perfect fit for us.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:13:43):**  And we've had a great partnership with Nori and Nori is a customer of SoilMetrics, which  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:13:48):**  is the private firm that helps Comet get into private context.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:13:52):**  If a carbon market wants to use Comet, SoilMetrics is the firm that's helping to license that.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:13:58):**  And we've had fabulous conversations with the soil scientists there that are just as  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:14:02):**  eager to get their hands on some of this data and to learn about why the model might not  
**[0:14:06-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:14:06):**  be capturing what's going on in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:14:09):**  And so we've been just putting scientists in the same room and comparing Excel data  
**[0:14:12-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:14:12):**  files and want to be able to make sure that this research is beneficial, not just to the  
**[0:14:18-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:14:18):**  first project we're doing, but to modeling writ large.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:14:21):**  And we have a similar relationship with DNDC, which is a model developed by Bill Salus.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:14:26):**  And we see this as a benefit to all carbon marketplaces.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:14:29):**  We're not trying to invent our own sort of registry and model.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:14:33):**  We think that this should be open source and available to everyone and replicated elsewhere.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:14:37):**  And so as we've been recruiting other farmers to join some of our project development efforts,  
**[0:14:43-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:14:43):**  we've been focusing on folks that also have access to research data sets.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:14:46):**  So we have a great partnership with some researchers at the University of Michigan.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:14:50):**  We have partnerships with other growers that are working with Rodale to study their rotations.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:14:56):**  And we want to create this kind of return on science, this return on science investment,  
**[0:15:01-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:15:01):**  where the projects can benefit from their investment in these soil cores.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:15:05):**  And really all of us can benefit from better accounting for this data going forward in  
**[0:15:09-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:15:09):**  these models.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:15:10):**  We think this is also probably should be a federal priority in terms of increasing the  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:15:14):**  number of soil sampling sites, making sure that they also account for some of these deep  
**[0:15:19-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:15:19):**  carbon impacts.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:15:20):**  But we think in the short term, we can start to collect this data to defray some of those  
**[0:15:24-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:15:24):**  costs of collecting soil cores by returning more value in terms of revenue.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:15:30):**  And eventually, hopefully, to have better process-based models so that farms that can't  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:15:33):**  afford to do that upfront can submit their management data.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:15:37):**  And if they're implementing these kind of management practices that generate changes  
**[0:15:41-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:15:41):**  lower in the soil profile, that they can benefit from that.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:15:43):**  You know that probably they stored X amount of, because you have the deeper data.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:15:48):**  And so the revenue streams you touched upon, which is a great bridge, how are you helping  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:15:53):**  to get more of that potential revenue if they stored so much more carbon because of the  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:15:58):**  practices and approaches they used?  
**[0:16:00-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:16:00):**  How are you helping to get more of that money to the farm?  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:16:03):**  We believe that carbon in general is tremendously underpriced right now.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:16:07):**  And while long term, we hope to be able to improve process-based models and improve accounting  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:16:12):**  for carbon, we think that the bigger impact that we can have is in increasing the price  
**[0:16:16-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:16:16):**  that farmers get for their carbon.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:16:19):**  And we think that carbon from agricultural projects is much more compelling of an offset  
**[0:16:25-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:16:25):**  than probably some of the projects that I used to develop in terms of preventing pollution  
**[0:16:29-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:16:29):**  at coal mines, landfill gas projects.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:16:31):**  I mean, I think a big mistake was looking at carbon and saying that this is a commodity,  
**[0:16:36-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:16:36):**  that this is something that is—  
**[0:16:37-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:16:37):**  It's all the same.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:16:38):**  Yeah, that it's undifferentiated.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:16:40):**  And obviously, in terms of the atmosphere, who cares if carbon is coming, is reduced  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:16:45):**  from a car or from a furnace or from a farm, and it's all the same.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:16:49):**  But because we don't have compliance markets that are—besides California and a few others—that  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:16:55):**  are sophisticated enough to do price discovery, we're competing in the marketplace.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:16:59):**  We're trying to compel consumers to, A, trust that emissions reductions are real and to  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:17:05):**  be inspired to actually participate in activating climate action.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:17:09):**  And we think that farms have the potential to be much more transparent.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:17:13):**  You can actually see the changes on the ground.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:17:15):**  You can even visit the farm where it is.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:17:17):**  I think people are excited about connecting with their growers.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:17:21):**  And we want to create the kind of farmers market experience of buying offsets and feeling  
**[0:17:26-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:17:26):**  like you are participating in this change-making process.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:17:29):**  So with our partners at Hudson Carbon, in addition to the research, we're launching  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:17:33):**  a marketplace to market their carbon and to connect the carbon offsets that they've generated  
**[0:17:38-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:17:38):**  to specific parcels on their land.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:17:40):**  You can zoom in and pick your parcels.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:17:42):**  You can see drone footage.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:17:43):**  You can see the changes of the land over time.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:17:46):**  You can see some of the data that they've collected.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:17:48):**  We make it a really interactive, immersive experience.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:17:51):**  Whereas I think a lot of carbon purchases are to far-flung places, to projects that  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:17:56):**  are hard to understand, and it's hard to see the inherent environmental impacts that  
**[0:18:00-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:18:00):**  are being created.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:18:02):**  So we're hoping to launch the Hudson Carbon marketplace either later this year or early  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:18:05):**  next year to market the credits from this first 2,000-acre project.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:18:10):**  And we're also looking to integrate with brands in a more compelling way, in a way that actually  
**[0:18:15-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:18:15):**  discovers a higher price.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:18:16):**  And so I think oftentimes, again, looking at the commodity model of marketing carbon  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:18:22):**  offsets, folks try to bundle as many credits together as they could generate and get whatever  
**[0:18:27-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:18:27):**  price they could get for that.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:18:29):**  We certainly did that in our work too.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:18:30):**  We might have 100,000 tons from our refrigerant work, and you try and get the highest price  
**[0:18:35-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:18:35):**  for that.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:18:36):**  But there are only certain customers that have enough demand to buy 100,000 tons of  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:18:42):**  credits, and they're going to be very price sensitive.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:18:46):**  But there are a lot of products out there.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:18:49):**  Because it's 100,000 tons.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:18:50):**  Yeah, it's a lot.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:18:51):**  Because it's 100,000 tons.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:18:52):**  That's a big check to write.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:18:54):**  But we have found that there are some emitters that have a much lower carbon footprint.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:18:58):**  So we're partnering with Lightphone, which is an alternative cell phone company.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:19:03):**  They have a really great ethos about disconnecting from technology and just having a phone that  
**[0:19:08-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:19:08):**  is a phone, not one that does everything else that distracts us.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:19:11):**  And hopefully that links us more closely to our surroundings and gives us a better connection  
**[0:19:16-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:19:16):**  to place.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:19:17):**  And they obviously are a bit more likely to be interested in nature, farming, agriculture,  
**[0:19:25-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:19:25):**  biodiversity and everything that comes around.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:19:27):**  100%.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:19:28):**  So we said, let's look at our projects as an opportunity to connect your purchases to  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:19:33):**  create a climate positive purchase and connect your consumers to this really exceptional  
**[0:19:38-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:19:38):**  project.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:19:39):**  And we said we wanted to price carbon at a rate that reflected the actual cost of carbon,  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:19:43):**  but also really reflected the opportunities that carbon creates for farmers.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:19:47):**  So what would it actually take for a farmer to transition to a system that prioritize  
**[0:19:52-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:19:52):**  carbon sequestration?  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:19:53):**  What would be massive enough to really say, okay, actually, I should fundamentally change  
**[0:19:57-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:19:57):**  my operation.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:19:58):**  So we set this astronomical price of $100 per ton, which is 10x what a lot of markets  
**[0:20:04-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:20:04):**  are offering farmers.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:20:05):**  But when we translated that into how much it costs per phone that they were selling  
**[0:20:10-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:20:10):**  to make a product climate positive, the consumer was only $3.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:20:15):**  So it's like 60 kilograms per phone.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:20:18):**  And Lightphone said, we'll take half of that and we'll do the other half of the carbon  
**[0:20:21-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:20:21):**  costs to offer to our customers.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:20:24):**  On a phone that costs?  
**[0:20:25-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:20:25):**  A few hundred bucks.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:20:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:20:27):**  So $3 is nothing, almost nothing.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:20:30):**  Exactly.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:20:31):**  But translating that back to what it means for a farmer in terms of revenue, I mean,  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:20:34):**  you can imagine if you really were able to get seven tons per acre at $100 per ton, that's  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:20:40):**  massively motivating.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:20:41):**  Even if you were able to get a fraction of that per acre, that's a hugely game changing  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:20:45):**  kind of calculation.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:20:47):**  Even if you just get the common outcome.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:20:49):**  Yeah, it's still a lot.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:20:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:20:51):**  And we don't want to over promise and we don't know how big that market will be and folks  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:20:55):**  that will want to pay at that level, but we think as e-commerce becomes more dominant  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:20:59):**  in our lives, as we feel a lot more sensitive about our consumption and many of us are stuck  
**[0:21:05-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:21:05):**  at home and really the only way we can consume is to have things shipped to us in boxes and  
**[0:21:10-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:21:10):**  to have this kind of environmental impact.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:21:12):**  And as we have kind of unsatisfying international and federal responses to climate change, we  
**[0:21:17-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:21:17):**  think this is an incredibly tangible way.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:21:19):**  There must be a market out there for at least the beginning.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:21:23):**  And then, I mean, I hate to bring in the Tesla model, you begin with the high end consumers  
**[0:21:27-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:21:27):**  or the high end buyers or the high end and slowly work your way down as science picks  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:21:31):**  up as more and more farmers, as more and more tools come available and it becomes cheaper  
**[0:21:36-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:21:36):**  and maybe 100 tons, also 50 is enough to push some or 60 or 70 or maybe the market picks  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:21:43):**  up and we are implementing the Swedish model where I think there are 150 now a tons and  
**[0:21:48-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:21:48):**  it just keeps rising.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:21:50):**  But if you can make it work with that for a while, you have a nice platform to build  
**[0:21:54-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:21:54):**  from there.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:21:55):**  Exactly.  
**[0:21:56-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:21:56):**  And so we are launching this platform and giving growers some say in how we market the  
**[0:21:59-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:21:59):**  credits too.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:22:00):**  So if you have cash flow needs, you're moving through the transition, you need to sell carbon  
**[0:22:04-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:22:04):**  at more of a high volume to lower strike price, we can help broker that.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:22:08):**  We have great relationships with other brands and with other off takers that want to buy  
**[0:22:13-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:22:13):**  carbon credits.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:22:14):**  But for those that want to take a risk, I mean, it's very much like how farmers market  
**[0:22:18-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:22:18):**  their grains, particularly regenerative farmers.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:22:20):**  If you have barley or malt or rye that could be potentially food grade, you might be able  
**[0:22:26-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:22:26):**  to market that to a brewer and get a significant premium for that.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:22:29):**  But sometimes it doesn't work out or sometimes you just need to send it for feed because  
**[0:22:33-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:22:33):**  you need cash to cover the price of seeds.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:22:35):**  We want to be responsive.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:22:36):**  And frankly, I think the carbon markets have just expected that providing anything to farmers,  
**[0:22:41-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:22:41):**  you know, if it's $10, it's $20 per acre, that will make this massive change.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:22:47):**  And it really fails to recognize the unique challenges of being a grower.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:22:51):**  And how do you make these long term decisions?  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:22:53):**  You know, do you really want to invest the time in the paperwork and just the headache  
**[0:22:58-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:22:58):**  of being a part of a carbon market, the revenue is uncertain.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:23:01):**  So we really want pride ourselves in being responsive developers really analyzing where  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:23:06):**  is where can we maximize value for the risk tolerance, the risk appetite of the farmer  
**[0:23:11-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:23:11):**  And looking at that $100 a tonne, what do you feel or see or research the potential  
**[0:23:16-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:23:16):**  market now?  
**[0:23:17-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:23:17):**  What do you feel?  
**[0:23:18-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:23:18):**  Okay, we don't know how big it's going to be in a couple of years.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:23:21):**  But how many acres can you touch in like a year, two years, three years?  
**[0:23:26-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:23:26):**  What do you feel comfortable in selling in terms of amount of tons for that price, which  
**[0:23:29-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:23:29):**  obviously sounds extremely high for many people listening?  
**[0:23:33-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:23:33):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:23:34):**  Well, we are looking to expand to another 100,000 acres over the next two years.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:23:39):**  And you know, we're trying to be responsible and not say like, this is the broadcast solution  
**[0:23:43-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:23:43):**  yet.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:23:44):**  Overpromised.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:23:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:23:46):**  So a lot of folks are have a high appetite for scale, you might start off with 5 million  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:23:51):**  acres to try and make it work.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:23:52):**  And so we're trying to move around gradually, both because we want to move the science along,  
**[0:23:57-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:23:57):**  which we think takes time, but also so we can build these great brand partnerships.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:24:00):**  But we've seen projections that the estimated carbon market by 2050 is a $200 billion market.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:24:06):**  Certainly Europe has taken a much bigger role in this in terms of creating carbon positive  
**[0:24:11-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:24:11):**  carbon neutral companies.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:24:13):**  We see even in the US, certainly with folks like Microsoft, that have said they want to  
**[0:24:18-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:24:18):**  offset the entire history of their company's emissions.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:24:21):**  All their electricity they ever use and you booting up Windows again, it's going to be  
**[0:24:25-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:24:25):**  yeah.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:24:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:24:27):**  Which is going to be interesting.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:24:28):**  Sure.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:24:29):**  That's a big amount.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:24:30):**  And I'd love to see companies say we want to do 3x our, you know, historic impact, particularly  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:24:33):**  if it's not changing the cost structure of their good.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:24:36):**  And I think like, it would be great if in the agricultural sector, we could sell grains  
**[0:24:41-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:24:41):**  for more money if they have these climate benefits.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:24:44):**  And we get this sort of imperfect premium from organic, which is not quite the same  
**[0:24:47-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:24:47):**  thing as the soil health benefits we're talking about.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:24:50):**  But there's really no other label that has emerged that says this is a climate positive  
**[0:24:55-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:24:55):**  benefit.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:24:56):**  And I think CPGs probably rightly are saying we don't want to take the risk of trying to  
**[0:25:00-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:25:00):**  increase our prices and get slammed in a really competitive market.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:25:03):**  So we've said, you know, are there other markets where there is this real openness and this  
**[0:25:07-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:25:07):**  real excitement to create a climate positive product?  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:25:10):**  And frankly, I think people are more often buying based on their values and abandoning  
**[0:25:15-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:25:15):**  brands that don't have those values.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:25:17):**  It seems to be I mean, companies like Microsoft, Stripe, Shopify have made very big commitments  
**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:25:23):**  or very large commitments compared to sometimes their size.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:25:27):**  I mean, Stripe and Shopify obviously, Shopify is quite large.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:25:29):**  If you compare all the marketplaces on it, all the shops on it, Microsoft obviously is  
**[0:25:34-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:25:34):**  enormous.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:25:35):**  Apple has said similar things.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:25:37):**  A number of cosmetic brands have said a lot of things and a number of very big food companies  
**[0:25:41-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:25:41):**  actually Danone and Nestle and some others.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:25:43):**  I think Cargill just came out with another 10 million acre promise, etc.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:25:48):**  And Walmart want to become a regenerative company.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:25:51):**  And so there's a lot of buzz now.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:25:54):**  And I was the question, okay, are you going to buy the cheapest offsets possible like  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:25:58):**  EasyJet did in Europe making all the flights carbon neutral, but buying I think two euros  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:26:03):**  a ton or something, or 210 like really, really, really low, still better than nothing and  
**[0:26:08-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:26:08):**  still putting pressure on everybody else.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:26:10):**  But let's raise the bar and let's see, okay, there, obviously, it would be a huge impact  
**[0:26:14-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:26:14):**  because it's such a carbon intensive industry.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:26:16):**  But for many others, it's really a margin somewhere like 123% that in terms of brand  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:26:23):**  awareness in terms of marketing, this space, if you do it well, could pay it back many,  
**[0:26:28-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:26:28):**  many times over if you're one of the first, which I think is a very exciting space where  
**[0:26:31-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:26:31):**  you know,  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:26:32):**  definitely, so I think it will be interesting to see as this becomes kind of a standard  
**[0:26:37-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:26:37):**  expectation of companies, do they invest their own resources?  
**[0:26:40-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:26:40):**  Did they partner with consumers to make this work?  
**[0:26:43-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:26:43):**  Do they find compelling ways to make this part of their story and kind of integral to  
**[0:26:46-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:26:46):**  the way that their strategy is a company?  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:26:48):**  Or does it become ancillary in a sort of, you know, commodity market?  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:26:53):**  And I think that this is going to be multi multi billion dollar investment over the next  
**[0:26:58-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:26:58):**  couple decades.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:27:00):**  But for me, I think there's this huge attraction to direct air capture to other sort of industrial  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:27:05):**  forms of carbon removal, which have a cost structure that needs more than $100 per ton  
**[0:27:10-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:27:10):**  to even start to become commercially viable.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:27:12):**  Yeah, but there you have Moore's law, and it's all going to be fine in a few years.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:27:18):**  But if you pitch it, like you said before, like to a VC, like we have this amazing technology  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:27:23):**  that uses microbes and can capture and grows food all at the same time.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:27:28):**  And like, it's really it's a, I wouldn't say marketing, but also communication piece, like  
**[0:27:32-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:27:32):**  we, this tech is already there.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:27:34):**  And it's about scaling, it's about the tools, I'm not saying it's done, and we just pump  
**[0:27:38-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:27:38):**  a lot of money in it, and we're okay.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:27:41):**  But it's definitely much more approachable, much more closer to us than a container that  
**[0:27:46-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:27:46):**  sucks up co2, which is great, but it requires a lot of resources.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:27:50):**  And I'm not saying even the money, I'm mainly saying the brainpower of people working on  
**[0:27:52-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:27:52):**  that, that we need actually in region, ag and food, we need more, more people working  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:27:56):**  on this in region, ag and food, more scientists doing the research you mentioned, because  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:28:00):**  these pieces are there, like the solar panels are there because they're the plants, the  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:28:04):**  battery is the soil and is already there has been time tested for the last few billion  
**[0:28:08-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:28:08):**  years.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:28:09):**  It's time we build some other tools and speed it up or take the 2 billion hectares of degraded  
**[0:28:15-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:28:15):**  land and start doing the same because the tools are there.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:28:18):**  It's about implementing and scaling it and maybe it's less sexy than inventing a new  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:28:22):**  genetically modified plan to absorb more solar or doing some vertical farming where I saw  
**[0:28:27-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:28:27):**  some interesting stats on the sense or nonsense of that.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:28:31):**  But this is about implementing scaling, rolling up a very much more tricky questions and okay,  
**[0:28:36-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:28:36):**  how do we implement this on 100,000 farms?  
**[0:28:38-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:28:38):**  How do you work with 100,000 farmers on this?  
**[0:28:40-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:28:40):**  How do we build markets around it on the product side?  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:28:43):**  Like you mentioned, like, how do we compensate farmers for the nutrient density?  
**[0:28:47-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:28:47):**  How do we compensate farmers for the carbon for the water?  
**[0:28:50-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:28:50):**  And that's, I think, very exciting, but we need more people that focus on that and build  
**[0:28:55-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:28:55):**  companies because that's at the end, we cannot all go and build direct carbon capture stuff  
**[0:29:02-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:29:02):**  and be very excited about it or electric airplanes, which are super important, but there's some  
**[0:29:06-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:29:06):**  other things to focus on.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:29:08):**  Sorry for the rant.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:29:09):**  No, no, I mean, totally aligned on it, you know, and I think that to me, working in carbon  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:29:15):**  offsets and sort of sectors that, you know, are on the decline and we're kind of a marginal  
**[0:29:20-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:29:20):**  part of our emissions going forward.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:29:22):**  To me, I wanted to work at like, what are our fundamental economic activities?  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:29:26):**  You know, agriculture is a massive part of our economies, a huge part of our future and  
**[0:29:31-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:29:31):**  food resilience.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:29:32):**  Is there a way to integrate these kind of practices into a massive industry like this?  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:29:37):**  And that's a big part of the why is to say like, you know, can we make this the most,  
**[0:29:42-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:29:42):**  one of the most compelling climate solutions to get this kind of investment?  
**[0:29:45-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:29:45):**  And in the process, can we attract a lot more people to practice regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:29:49-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:29:49):**  to moving back to rural communities, to allowing communities to really thrive and become more  
**[0:29:54-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:29:54):**  resilient because of that investment?  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:29:56):**  To me, to have just the project that sucks air down, it doesn't value that carbon is  
**[0:30:00-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:30:00):**  really this potential asset.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:30:02):**  It says we just want to be rid of it.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:30:04):**  We want some technical solutions to make us feel less guilty about what we've emitted,  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:30:07):**  as opposed to recognizing that these are natural systems that we can restore balance to.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:30:12):**  And I think that this kind of investment opportunity makes that possible and makes it really exciting  
**[0:30:16-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:30:16):**  to eat and to consume again, instead of to make it feel very good.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:30:21):**  Which gets you back to the kitchen when you were a dad at home cooking ingredients and  
**[0:30:26-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:30:26):**  thinking about your next steps.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:30:28):**  I love putting the works of our guests to like the ITN framework, which is importance,  
**[0:30:34-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:30:34):**  tractability and neglectiveness.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:30:35):**  And tractability in this case is not traceability, but how solvable is the problem, which we  
**[0:30:40-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:30:40):**  touched upon.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:30:41):**  Like there's, there's a lot happening.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:30:42):**  There's a lot happening on measurement.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:30:44):**  And we hardly have to cover in this podcast because I hope everyone is listening, who  
**[0:30:49-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:30:49):**  is listening to this, understands the importance of, of completely, I wouldn't say reinventing  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:30:54):**  agriculture, but land use and sea use as well.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:30:56):**  I hope to do a series next year on regenerative aquaculture, which is going to be very interesting,  
**[0:31:01-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:31:01):**  but neglectiveness is a thorny one.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:31:03):**  Like, are there many other people working on how to get the carbon price up basically  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:31:07):**  to a level that is interesting for farmers?  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:31:11):**  Do you see other people moving that space to what are you very lonely?  
**[0:31:16-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:31:16):**  What's happening in like the, the area of how to get a hundred or maybe more dollars  
**[0:31:20-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:31:20):**  a ton for carbon stored by farmers?  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:31:22):**  Yeah, I think that it is a bit of a white space and a bit neglected.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:31:26):**  And I think a part of it is just kind of our fascination with scale and getting to scale  
**[0:31:30-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:31:30):**  quickly.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:31:31):**  And I think a lot of the, the ways people have capitalized these kinds of climate opportunities  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:31:36):**  has been with VC that is expecting really short term quick 10 X returns.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:31:41):**  And we are a mission focused company and we've, our revenue model currently is based on consulting  
**[0:31:46-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:31:46):**  and building great partnerships with organizations on the ground.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:31:49):**  And we're not expecting to grow quite as quickly.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:31:52):**  I think that that allows us to be a little bit more patient with the science and to develop  
**[0:31:56-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:31:56):**  something that we think works for the premium side of the market first and really rewards  
**[0:32:01-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:32:01):**  best in class growers first.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:32:03):**  But in a way that hopefully has these kinds of benefits that accrue to the rest of the  
**[0:32:07-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:32:07):**  sector.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:32:08):**  And I don't think that everyone needs to be a regenerative organic farm and to go through  
**[0:32:12-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:32:12):**  the certification costs of that and to go through the challenges of it.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:32:15):**  But we want to make sure that, that it really works for our target market first and elicit  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:32:20):**  some of these high prices that maybe shift the rest of the carbon conversation.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:32:24):**  And frankly, when you have higher carbon prices, it doesn't just mean that you're spending  
**[0:32:28-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:32:28):**  a lot of carbon.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:32:29):**  It also means that you might be thinking differently about what emissions you do have.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:32:32):**  And so hopefully it has a consequence in emitting industries too, to say like, oh, these prices  
**[0:32:36-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:32:36):**  are what's emerging.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:32:37):**  So it's what your customers are willing to pay.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:32:39):**  We should also curtail, we should figure out, innovate and make those investments.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:32:43):**  I think the investment case is much stronger once you do that.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:32:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:32:47):**  Once your internal rate of carbon is high, you start, I know Microsoft, I don't remember  
**[0:32:50-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:32:50):**  the internal rate they have, but I think it was 15.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:32:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:32:54):**  They look at projects with an internal rate, which already makes how you invest in data  
**[0:32:58-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:32:58):**  centers, et cetera, very different.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:32:59):**  I mean, 15, like you said, is absolutely not enough, but it is a start because it's more  
**[0:33:03-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:33:03):**  than zero.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:33:05):**  And you look at projects differently when you have an internal carbon rate.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:33:08):**  And if you're actually paying for that carbon a hundred, suddenly the whole, hopefully the  
**[0:33:12-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:33:12):**  whole discussion internally starts shifting.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:33:14):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:33:15):**  So I think that this is, I mean, while carbon markets, I think have more, more excitement  
**[0:33:20-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:33:20):**  than ever, I think, particularly in ag and there's a lot more activity, a lot more interest,  
**[0:33:24-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:33:24):**  even from, you know, big fortune 500 companies.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:33:27):**  I think the desire to get going quickly and I get it, there's a lot of urgency and we  
**[0:33:31-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:33:31):**  need to implement solutions quickly.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:33:33):**  I think it has meant that people have ignored some of these fundamental issues, you know,  
**[0:33:38-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:33:38):**  and both on the price side and on the quantity of credits and really counting precisely and  
**[0:33:43-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:33:43):**  more accurately and hopefully more substantially the benefits of regenerative approaches.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:33:47):**  So we think this is a kind of a unique contribution to the movement.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:33:52):**  And what do you see or think smart investors should look out for?  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:33:56):**  Let's imagine there's a room of smart impact investors, a full theater, obviously social  
**[0:34:01-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:34:01):**  distancing or zooming in, but let's imagine it's a virtual theater.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:34:05):**  So we're all there and we're all safe.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:34:07):**  Listening to this and seeing you on stage, they get it.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:34:10):**  They are deep into soil, read the books, listened to the podcasts, saw the videos, visited the  
**[0:34:15-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:34:15):**  farms.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:34:16):**  What should they look out for when they want to make their first investments?  
**[0:34:19-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:34:19):**  Obviously without giving investment advice, but what would be some places you would start  
**[0:34:23-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:34:23):**  if you would be a new investors that has, let's say, done the homework to get started?  
**[0:34:27-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:34:27):**  I would take the time to think about what it would really take for a farmer to make  
**[0:34:31-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:34:31):**  a big fundamental transition.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:34:33):**  And when you say that, do you mean go and sit down and spend time with a farmer or think  
**[0:34:38-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:34:38):**  about it theoretically?  
**[0:34:39-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:34:39):**  How do I figure that out from a city?  
**[0:34:41-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:34:41):**  I mean, I think it's hard to have the perspective of a farmer if you don't talk to them, you  
**[0:34:45-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:34:45):**  know, and I certainly spend a lot of time talking to folks that were part of the old  
**[0:34:49-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:34:49):**  wind projects, talking to new farmer friends of mine, and certainly speaking to folks that  
**[0:34:53-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:34:53):**  I'm on the board of the Delta Institute in Chicago, and they do a lot of incredible work  
**[0:34:57-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:34:57):**  in rural communities and getting perspectives of their staff and farmers.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:35:01):**  I think taking that time is critical to be able to design something that doesn't just  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:35:06):**  look good on a spreadsheet, but actually like resonates with what growers need.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:35:11):**  And so to me, I think that the best investments are in improving the kind of revenue position  
**[0:35:17-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:35:17):**  of farmers through that transition.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:35:18):**  So carbon is one of the options that they might have.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:35:21):**  Another is looking at the full rotation, looking at cover crops and alfalfa and saying like,  
**[0:35:26-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:35:26):**  are there ways we can improve that product?  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:35:28):**  You know, I think Oatly was such an interesting new product, the new oat milk brand, because  
**[0:35:33-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:35:33):**  there's a cover crop that can make a really useful, great consumer product.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:35:38):**  And you know, historically, Iowa and Nebraska farmers integrated quite a bit of oats into  
**[0:35:42-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:35:42):**  the rotation as our diet changed less so.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:35:46):**  If there were similar products that looked at rye and looked at barley and looked at  
**[0:35:51-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:35:51):**  clover and said, hey, farmers will give you a really nice price for...  
**[0:35:57-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:35:57):**  Also if it's not the high end food grade when it can go to a brewer, but like when it's  
**[0:36:00-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:36:00):**  just below that or a bit below, then you have an interesting product because you're not  
**[0:36:05-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:36:05):**  you're competing with feed industry, which is a lot easier than with the brewing industry.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:36:09):**  Exactly.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:36:10):**  So I think those kinds of investments are really interesting.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:36:13):**  And I take a perspective that if there is an investment opportunity that's really attractive  
**[0:36:19-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:36:19):**  and creates these kind of mission returns, it's going to have no trouble attracting capital.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:36:22):**  And I do think that there is a need for some of the concessionary capital to help bake  
**[0:36:27-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:36:27):**  out some of the risk in these initial ideas so that you can have something that flows  
**[0:36:31-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:36:31):**  billions of dollars of capital behind it.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:36:33):**  And that's been the kind of guiding light between a lot of our work is where we feel  
**[0:36:38-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:36:38):**  like we're investing our time at sort of a concessionary rate to make sure that these  
**[0:36:43-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:36:43):**  opportunities happen.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:36:44):**  You know, I think figuring out ways to get people back onto the land, I mean, I think  
**[0:36:48-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:36:48):**  regenerative approaches are more labor intensive.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:36:51):**  It needs a slightly different skill set potentially and require just more of us to spend time  
**[0:36:56-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:36:56):**  in rural communities.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:36:58):**  And I think there's a real opportunity in this transition.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:37:01):**  Which is a good thing.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:37:02):**  Which is a great thing.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:37:03):**  And I think there's a real opportunity to think about reparative approaches in agriculture  
**[0:37:07-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:37:07):**  and saying, you know, there have been historic land injustice in indigenous communities and  
**[0:37:11-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:37:11):**  communities of color.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:37:13):**  And I think there's a real appetite to be able to return to the land in a way that creates  
**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:37:17):**  a reparative impact and allows people to feel like they're creating a legacy on the land.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:37:22):**  And so if there are ways to use investors' balance sheets to ensure equipment loans to  
**[0:37:27-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:37:27):**  potentially own land and lease it at lower rates to farmers, new farmers, to really think  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:37:32):**  intentionally about coordinating investments around grain infrastructure so that farmers  
**[0:37:37-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:37:37):**  can be successful if they're adopting these practices, introducing new grains into the  
**[0:37:41-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:37:41):**  rotation.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:37:42):**  I think figuring out ways to allow people to return to agriculture that want to do so  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:37:46):**  and giving them the tools so that they're successful and hopefully not too leveraged  
**[0:37:50-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:37:50):**  and in debt and taking on more risk than they deserve to.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:37:53):**  I think those are really great potential deployments of capital.  
**[0:37:56-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:37:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:37:57):**  We had Chris Newman on the show of Sylvan Aqua Farms who are building an incredibly  
**[0:38:01-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:38:01):**  interesting collective of farmers basically taking the regen approach and really building  
**[0:38:06-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:38:06):**  quite a massive movement.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:38:08):**  I wouldn't be surprised if in a few years we'll look back at and they raised a significant  
**[0:38:12-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:38:12):**  amount of money and put it to work in regenerating hundreds of thousands of hectares or acres  
**[0:38:17-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:38:17):**  in this case.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:38:18):**  That would actually get us to, it's a nice bridge to what if you be in charge of a billion  
**[0:38:22-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:38:22):**  dollars investment portfolio?  
**[0:38:24-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:38:24):**  You can invest it the way you like, but invest it not granted, but it could be very long  
**[0:38:28-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:38:28):**  term, very low interest rate, could be any mix of form you would like.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:38:33):**  What would you prioritize with this one billion dollar investment portfolio?  
**[0:38:38-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:38:38):**  Well, I mean, obviously regenerative agriculture in a broad sense.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:38:42):**  I thought you were going to say VC in direct capture, but no.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:38:46):**  Oh yeah, no, right.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:38:48):**  Well, I do think these reparative approaches are really important and could use an influx  
**[0:38:52-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:38:52):**  of capital.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:38:53):**  I think in order to make some of those investments even more attractive and bake out some of  
**[0:38:58-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:38:58):**  the risk, I do think that there should be more investment in the science and the kind  
**[0:39:04-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:39:04):**  of mechanics of carbon projects.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:39:06):**  And I think the more that you can kind of bake in compelling revenue streams for farmers  
**[0:39:10-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:39:10):**  that are taking this leap, whether they're new farmers or whether they're established  
**[0:39:13-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:39:13):**  farmers, I think the better.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:39:15):**  And so one of the gaps in terms of registering farmers into carbon markets is just the data  
**[0:39:21-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:39:21):**  issues of having to collect management data, sort of go back in time if there are gaps  
**[0:39:26-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:39:26):**  in that data and fill in some of those gaps.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:39:29):**  And we've been spending a lot of time looking at remote sensing technologies and looking  
**[0:39:33-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:39:33):**  at sensors, looking at other ways to be able to capture that information that don't require  
**[0:39:38-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:39:38):**  a huge headache from farmers.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:39:39):**  And at current carbon prices, I think the biggest barrier to farmers participating in  
**[0:39:44-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:39:44):**  carbon market is they just don't want the headache.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:39:46):**  They think their time is better spent focusing on their operation.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:39:49):**  And probably if you get a few dollars a ton, it is.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:39:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:39:53):**  If you can get it up a little bit, if you can aggregate projects more effectively, which  
**[0:39:56-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:39:56):**  is something we're working on to spread some of the verification costs, all of that is  
**[0:40:00-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:40:00):**  really beneficial.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:40:01):**  But we're part of a coalition called the Climate Trace Coalition, which is a group started  
**[0:40:05-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:40:05):**  by Al Gore, actually, looking at remote sensing technologies across different industries and  
**[0:40:12-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:40:12):**  figuring out are there independent ways to measure emissions that don't require self-reporting,  
**[0:40:17-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:40:17):**  which is fundamentally what we're talking about in agriculture is self-reporting of  
**[0:40:20-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:40:20):**  management practices and running it through some complicated model.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:40:24):**  And it would be better to be able to have a direct way to measure that.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:40:28):**  And so we're working on that as coalition members with Hudson Park and also as a partner.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:40:34):**  So I think that's a really key area.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:40:36):**  And if you're investing in this soil core research and really digging literally deeper  
**[0:40:41-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:40:41):**  to understand the benefits of certain management systems, I think you can calibrate those measurement  
**[0:40:48-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:40:48):**  approaches, those remote sensing approaches much better.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:40:50):**  So I would love to invest in many more research sites that look both at conventional fields  
**[0:40:55-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:40:55):**  that look at maybe even untouched landscapes to understand the kind of carrying capacity  
**[0:41:00-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:41:00):**  of carbon and to look at really outstanding regenerative systems and be able to invite  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:41:06):**  anyone that has a new sensor or has a new technology to be able to test it against those  
**[0:41:11-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:41:11):**  kind of direct measurements, which are the most accurate, most expensive ways to estimate  
**[0:41:17-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:41:17):**  carbon sequestration.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:41:18):**  Of course, of course.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:41:19):**  That's always the case.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:41:20):**  And if you had a magic wand and you could change one thing overnight in the egg and  
**[0:41:25-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:41:25):**  food space, what would that be?  
**[0:41:27-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:41:27):**  I think that there is a real opportunity for the public sector to put their resources behind  
**[0:41:34-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:41:34):**  these benefits.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:41:35):**  There's so many externalised benefits, not just in terms of carbon sequestration and  
**[0:41:38-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:41:38):**  climate mitigation, but also in resilience to extreme weather and to securing our food  
**[0:41:44-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:41:44):**  systems.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:41:45):**  And I think there's a real public investment opportunity.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:41:48):**  I think one of the great analogies that has worked for the renewable energy sector is  
**[0:41:51-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:41:51):**  the production tax credit, that there was this incentive that the Treasury Department  
**[0:41:56-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:41:56):**  allowed for that said for every kilowatt hour of renewable energy that you produced, you  
**[0:42:03-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:42:03):**  could collect a tax credit that would motivate other investors to get involved in the project  
**[0:42:07-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:42:07):**  and clean the benefits of those tax credits.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:42:09):**  And it flowed in an enormous amount of capital.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:42:11):**  It would be really great if there was a similar incentive in agriculture and it wouldn't necessarily  
**[0:42:16-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:42:16):**  have to be instead of a carbon credit.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:42:18):**  It could say the same way that a renewable energy project can claim both renewable energy  
**[0:42:24-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:42:24):**  credits and these production tax credits.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:42:26):**  You could have a carbon incentive from the government to actually put equipment in place,  
**[0:42:32-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:42:32):**  put a research operation to implement these practices, and then also to market carbon  
**[0:42:36-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:42:36):**  credits on top of that.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:42:37):**  I don't think it would necessarily create additionality issues.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:42:41):**  And it would just jumpstart the market and that would create a whole lot more trust among  
**[0:42:45-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:42:45):**  growers to take this kind of plunge.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:42:48):**  And we already offer similar incentives to direct air capture facilities at $35 a ton.  
**[0:42:55-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:42:55):**  You could potentially have an enormous benefit in directing those programs towards agriculture  
**[0:43:00-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:43:00):**  instead of these sort of industrial projects.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:43:03):**  That would be a big one.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:43:04):**  I think it would be really fun to think about government procurement programs and we procure  
**[0:43:09-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:43:09):**  a lot of food for school lunches, for hospital systems, prisons.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:43:14):**  And if you could, and I do think that food, if you have higher quality grains in your  
**[0:43:18-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:43:18):**  food, you're conveying nutritional benefits.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:43:21):**  If you could direct some of those programs through GSA or what have you to start thinking  
**[0:43:26-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:43:26):**  about putting together off taker agreements with growers or with grain elevators and saying,  
**[0:43:30-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:43:30):**  we want these specific kinds of grains and really putting the word out to growers that  
**[0:43:35-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:43:35):**  if you commit to growing them as part of your rotation, you're going to have some price  
**[0:43:39-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:43:39):**  certainty to be able to do it.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:43:40):**  Well, I mean, the food one is fascinating, a previous guest on the show, Pierre Ville,  
**[0:43:46-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:43:46):**  which I will link below as well.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:43:48):**  They are starting in France, their first, I think it's the first research trial in what  
**[0:43:54-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:43:54):**  is the impact of diet on COVID patients, specifically mix of Omega-3 and 6 ratios where they did  
**[0:44:00-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:44:00):**  already a lot of research and they see the impact on inflammatory diseases and also on  
**[0:44:05-0:44:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:44:05):**  patients at risk or people at risk of COVID, so elderly with certain type.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:44:09):**  And he said the surprising thing is the amount of money thrown at vaccines or the technical  
**[0:44:14-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:44:14):**  solution, the chemical solution, and not looking at the underlying or looking at this way less  
**[0:44:21-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:44:21):**  expensive solution of diets, of food, food as medicine, which are food as prevention  
**[0:44:26-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:44:26):**  in this case and partly maybe as medicine.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:44:28):**  Obviously, it's not that we can go there immediately, but there's a lot of research needed there  
**[0:44:32-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:44:32):**  to see what the impact is.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:44:33):**  And he said, honestly, we were surprised we're the only one looking at this and starting  
**[0:44:37-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:44:37):**  to look at, okay, can we show?  
**[0:44:39-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:44:39):**  Because they've shown a lot of things like changing diet and within a month they could  
**[0:44:43-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:44:43):**  see a lot of changes in breast milk with breastfeeding.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:44:47):**  They could see a lot of changes and just changing the diet in this case, I will link the interview  
**[0:44:50-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:44:50):**  below, but just changing the diet of the feed of the animals.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:44:54):**  So this is animal protein, changing the feed of the animal and then the impact on the animal  
**[0:44:58-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:44:58):**  itself obviously, but then actually the protein could be the milk, could be the meat, could  
**[0:45:01-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:45:01):**  be et cetera, et cetera, had a huge impact on us, the ones that were eating that protein.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:45:05):**  That was a month, they said, we believe we can see a lot in a lot of other diseases as  
**[0:45:10-0:45:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:45:10):**  well and actually there's an enormous field in terms of diets, et cetera.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:45:14):**  And I heard somebody, one of the main investors in the space calling it, we're absolutely  
**[0:45:18-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:45:18):**  in the stone age when it comes to nutrition, agriculture, and what we know in terms of  
**[0:45:23-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:45:23):**  how that actually flows from healthy soils to healthy produce, to healthy gut and healthy  
**[0:45:27-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:45:27):**  people.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:45:28):**  But it's very exciting, but very unvalued at the moment.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:45:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:45:31):**  I think the idea of food as medicine, prescribing food for different things makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:45:35):**  I mean, if you think about, you know, the majority of what we put into our bodies is  
**[0:45:39-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:45:39):**  food and liquids, you know.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:45:41):**  It's funny that cosmetics is almost further ahead than food.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:45:44):**  If you look at regenerative cosmetics brands that are really, because it's such a big thing  
**[0:45:48-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:45:48):**  that you put on your skin, but the food space is still very much in super foods and some  
**[0:45:54-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:45:54):**  other things that are so specific and so taken out of context that it's, we're doing it,  
**[0:45:58-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:45:58):**  we're trying to do more interviews on this space because it's such an important, could  
**[0:46:01-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:46:01):**  be such an important consumer drive.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:46:02):**  Like if we finally can be able to show a lot of these things, it could lead to hopefully  
**[0:46:07-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:46:07):**  first of all, the high end markets, which could be the hospitals, could be the people  
**[0:46:10-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:46:10):**  that really, really, really need better food.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:46:12):**  And then slowly coming to more general public that maybe benefits, but not tremendously  
**[0:46:18-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:46:18):**  from another food system.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:46:19):**  But let's start with the ones that really, really need it.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:46:21):**  And in this case, it's a lot of people in hospitals that absolutely need better food.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:46:25):**  Well, I would be remiss also not to shout out on the cosmetic space and the therapeutic  
**[0:46:30-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:46:30):**  space.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:46:31):**  But we do, one of the partners sort of in our group with Hudson Carbon is Hudson Hemp,  
**[0:46:36-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:46:36):**  which is a regenerative hemp operation.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:46:38):**  And they found that, I mean, they have fantastic CBD products and other cosmetic products,  
**[0:46:44-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:46:44):**  but what they found is that hemp is actually a really great way to A, regenerate the land  
**[0:46:48-0:46:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:46:48):**  and B, to potentially give growers the first experience with organic and that you can transition  
**[0:46:54-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:46:54):**  a pretty small acreage.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:46:55):**  You can transition four acres, 10 acres fields to hemp and get it certified.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:47:00):**  And there's a much better premium for organic hemp than conventional.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:47:04):**  Most buyers of hemp products and CBD products care about being organic and being natural.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:47:11):**  And it can be sort of a regenerative gateway crop.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:47:14):**  A gateway drug.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:47:15):**  Yeah, no, no, no.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:47:17):**  Like organic milk is from any new parents or I mean, we need to start somewhere.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:47:21):**  That's the, I think also the summary of this interview.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:47:24):**  We need to start somewhere with high prices of carbon and then work our way, I wouldn't  
**[0:47:29-0:47:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:47:29):**  say down or up, but through the value chain or through the value web to make sure it scales  
**[0:47:33-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:47:33):**  or broadens it.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:47:34):**  And if people are willing to pay and there are, because we have a global audience, I  
**[0:47:39-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:47:39):**  mean, there are people willing to pay and companies willing to insert this into their  
**[0:47:43-0:47:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:47:43):**  product because it does make a difference and it does make a difference in marketing  
**[0:47:46-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:47:46):**  and storytelling.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:47:48):**  It's a start.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:47:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:47:50):**  I think that that's the real lesson is that I think we under invest always in the marketing  
**[0:47:53-0:47:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:47:53):**  and storytelling.  
**[0:47:55-0:48:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:47:55):**  And I think that this can be an incredibly compelling, immersive category of potential  
**[0:48:00-0:48:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:48:00):**  products and goods and investments.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:48:02):**  I think because a lot of smart people are involved in it, they approach it from a very  
**[0:48:06-0:48:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:48:06):**  analytical place instead of an emotional place.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:48:08):**  And I think the idea of being able to transform places, to transform our health, to transform  
**[0:48:13-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:48:13):**  our communities by making these kinds of investments is incredibly compelling.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:48:17):**  And we need, we, in our marketplace, we are making sure that there are profiles for each  
**[0:48:22-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:48:22):**  of the farmers.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:48:23):**  You hear about their story, you hear about that, you see their faces, you see what they  
**[0:48:26-0:48:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:48:26):**  had had to go through to be able to get to this point where they can make these kinds  
**[0:48:30-0:48:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:48:30):**  of meaningful benefits and figuring out how to convey that within great products and kind  
**[0:48:35-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:48:35):**  of user consumer experiences is so critical to making this mainstream.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:48:39):**  I think it's a perfect ending of this interview.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:48:42):**  I want to thank you so much for your time, Sam.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:48:44):**  It's not going to be the last time I think we chat on this.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:48:48):**  And I wish you a lot of luck to launch the marketplace, like hopefully end of this year,  
**[0:48:51-0:48:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:48:51):**  otherwise beginning of next year and to see the first results of that.

**[0:50:16-0:50:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:50:16):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:50:20-0:50:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:50:20):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:50:24):**  Why are we doing this course after a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of  
**[0:50:28-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:50:28):**  audio asking the question how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been  
**[0:50:32-0:50:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:50:32):**  following the space since 2011 and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was  
**[0:50:37-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:50:37):**  time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:51:36-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:51:36):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:51:40):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:51:45-0:51:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:51:45):**  different means.  
**[0:51:46-0:51:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:51:46):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:51:51-0:51:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:51:51):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:51:54-0:51:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:51:54):**  Thank you.  
**[0:51:55-0:51:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:51:55):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:51:56-0:52:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:51:56):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:52:02):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:52:04):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:52:09-0:52:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:52:09):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:52:15-0:52:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:52:15):**  invest in and what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:52:19-0:52:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:52:19):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:52:21):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:52:26-0:52:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:52:26):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:52:30):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:52:35-0:52:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:52:35):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:52:36-0:52:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:52:36):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:52:38):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:52:40):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:52:44):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/15/sam-schiller#t=0:52:46):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

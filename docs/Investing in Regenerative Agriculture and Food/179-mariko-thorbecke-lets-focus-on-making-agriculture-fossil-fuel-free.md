**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:00:14):**  If you care about the climate you stop eating beef.  For sure you've seen these kind of headlines and as a listener of this podcast you know  the reality is much more nuanced and way more complex.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:00:24):**  Today we dive deep into the research side of regenerative agriculture and I feel confident  to say that most of the research, if not all, you've seen about the climate impact of agriculture  is completely wrong.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:00:35):**  For instance, did you know that most life cycle assessments, or LCAs, that's our current  standard to compare the environmental impact of products to each other, never took into  consideration the soil carbon sequestration potential of agriculture, so it only looked  
**[0:00:48-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:00:48):**  at the emission side of things.  And as we'll discover today that is extremely, extremely simplified.  Or the amazing topic of CO2 equivalent, which tries to boil everything down to one number  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:00:57):**  and doesn't look at the differences between methane, CO2, fossil carbon, etc.  And you might have seen these titles of a few articles a few years ago about claiming  that beef and other animal protein can be farmed carbon positively or negatively depending  
**[0:01:10-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:01:10):**  on your point of view.  Where did this research come from and how is it done and most importantly what are the  challenges, what are the pieces still missing in this life cycle assessment world and how  
**[0:01:20-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:01:20):**  can we make this type of research more robust.  Enjoy!  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast, Investing as if the Planet  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:01:31):**  Mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:01:45):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:01:56):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  To make it easy for fans to support our work we launched our membership community and so

**[0:02:24-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:02:24):**  Welcome to another interview today with Mariko Torbeck, independent consultant bridging between  corporate climate and net zero commitments and regenerative agriculture.  Welcome Mariko.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:02:36):**  Thanks, Colin.  Thanks for having me.  And maybe some people won't recognize your name, but I've definitely seen your work on  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:02:44):**  the lifecycle assessment pieces and especially looking for the first time in the world to  do soil carbon into multi-stack species operations, et cetera, et cetera.  But to start with a personal question, when did your fascination for soil or how did you  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:03:01):**  roll into the lifecycle assessment space focused on regenerative agriculture?  What was that?  Do you remember how you got into this space?  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:03:08):**  Because you can do life cycle assessments and this kind of research anywhere or in many,  many other places and ag is definitely not the first place people think about.  And somehow you ended up working mostly on this.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:03:20):**  How did that happen?  Yeah, I mean, for me personally, I would say it's really been for the love of food.  My husband and I have a two acre micro farm where we have dairy goats and chickens and  
**[0:03:34-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:03:34):**  ducks and a really big garden.  I think at this point, many people know that food and health are intricately connected.  I think working in nature and with nature and mental health are intricately connected.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:03:51):**  And I think that a big part of what I enjoy is kind of bridging between the sort of small  scale, having a little agricultural sandbox area in my own home and figuring out how does  that then scale globally and within the context of what a lot of the global food and ag companies  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:04:13):**  are looking at, which is typically using LCA or life cycle assessment as a tool to better  understand where the impacts and opportunities lie within agriculture.  And farming yourself as well on a small scale, but nonetheless farming, what's been the biggest  
**[0:04:32-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:04:32):**  surprise or the biggest lessons learned doing this yourself and not just, quote unquote,  obviously researching this from a distance with your academic hat on?  Yeah, I mean, maybe it's no surprise, but I think one thing we've definitely discovered  
**[0:04:50-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:04:50):**  in the last three years is that the best laid plans almost never come to fruition.  But there are always important lessons to be learned along the way.  I mean, a few examples this year has been absolute insanity with the highly pathogenic  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:05:12):**  avian influenza that's been going around the US.  So I had my entire rotational grazing plan in place for the goats, the ducks, and the  chickens.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:05:29):**  And then all of a sudden we were basically told that we need to quarantine all of our  birds and keep them confined inside.  So that's an example of where things didn't go to plan.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:05:40):**  But I think that soil health and really understanding the interactions between the livestock, the  plants, the soil, and as well, just there's so many things to learn about even like parasite  management and livestock management that we've definitely learned a lot in the last three  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:02):**  years.  Made several mistakes, but every year we see some really good improvements to what we're  doing.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:09):**  And just to look at that, I think many people in this space saw some of your coming out  and now I think two or three years ago on white oak pastures.  And I think the first LCA is honestly looking at a larger regenerative system and got very  
**[0:06:27-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:27):**  excited when they saw the infographics that you could store this amount of carbon.  And this was done when you were working at QANTIS and I think paid for by General Mills.  Can you summarize?  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:37):**  I mean, I will link below obviously the papers, which I recommend everybody to read and go  deeper into this just to understand the dynamics and limitations and the opportunities, et  cetera.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:47):**  But can you summarize it in a few sentences?  What was the body of work?  Why is it so unique?  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:51):**  And then we'll go to the outcomes as well and what it tells us and what it doesn't tell  us.  Yeah.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:57):**  And summarizing all of it in a few sentences might be a bit challenging.  A few more is fine.  We have time.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:07:02):**  Yeah.  I mean, this work, the bulk of it was done back in 2018.  So that's I guess around four years ago now.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:07:12):**  And basically at that point in time, most companies were leveraging life cycle assessment  to better understand the sort of impacts and opportunities within agriculture.  However, one of the challenges with life cycle assessment at the time was that it was basically  
**[0:07:32-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:07:32):**  a tool that was quantifying or estimating emissions associated with agriculture and  not looking at, you know, carbon's part of a cycle.  So there's emissions of carbon, but then there's also carbon sequestration and carbon sinks  
**[0:07:49-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:07:49):**  such as in soil and biomass.  So basically LCA was looking at one half of the equation, which makes agriculture look  insanely bad and wasn't looking at the sequestration potential.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:08:04):**  Now anecdotally at the time there had been a lot of articles and sort of examples of  farms that were using regenerative grazing practices, things like rotational grazing  using multi-species.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:08:23):**  And anecdotally we're seeing improvements to the health of their soil, to the increase  in their topsoil and the health of the land.  And what we wanted to do was to try and see could we capture some of these benefits in  
**[0:08:40-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:08:40):**  an LCA and how might that change the narrative around what agriculture could look like beyond  just looking at how do we produce food in a way that's as carbon efficient as possible  from an emissions standpoint to looking at if we start to look at the sequestration,  
**[0:09:01-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:09:01):**  do some of these systems that a lot of people would consider to be inefficient, either inefficient  uses of land or inefficient uses of carbon, would they actually fare better if we started  to quantify the soil carbon sequestration?  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:09:18):**  So through this work was funded by General Mills.  At the time they had just acquired the Epic brand which makes like animal protein like  beef jerky type bars.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:09:32):**  And they had one farm in their supply chain in particular called White Oak Pastures who  had been basically practicing this regenerative grazing holistic land management for at the  time around 20 years.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:09:46):**  And so it kind of provided the perfect opportunity to combine General Mills' desire to better  understand regenerative agriculture, to better quantify their company and their subsidiaries'  carbon emissions in a more holistic way.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:10:05):**  And yeah, that led to this body of work.  And what shocks me is that on the LCA side or on all of this research is that the potential  or the drawdown potential wasn't really looked at until now.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:10:20):**  Mostly the pollution side of things or the emission equivalent, which is always a tricky  one because we put everything under one number at the end, but we'll talk about that as well.  So this was and is revolutionary work.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:10:34):**  Has been seen since then because you mentioned this is work you did four years ago or the  research side was four years ago, then of course written, peer reviewed and published,  which means we're four years further down the line.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:10:46):**  But have you seen others like taking that challenge of even I mean, the first challenge  of like trying to quantify the potential of drawdown in soil and biomass or unfortunately  it has been a very, very empty field until now?  
**[0:11:02-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:11:02):**  Yeah, no, I think at the time, if one was to do a literature review on soil carbon sequestration  in LCA, there was almost nothing that was popping up.  Now we know others were working on this simultaneously, but due to the nature of research and publishing,  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:11:23):**  we didn't actually see those papers coming out until several years later.  So I would say since then, a lot of kind of papers and articles have been focused on how  do we start to quantify the drawdown, the soil carbon sequestration.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:11:40):**  And in particular, it's been a pretty hot topic amongst the kind of corporate climate  commitment space.  The Science Based Targets Initiative back in February just published their draft Forest,  
**[0:11:56-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:11:56):**  Land and Agriculture Guidance for how companies can set targets related to land and agricultural  based emissions.  And it now looks like they're moving from a previous state, which was not allowing companies  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:12:11):**  to account for soil carbon sequestration or for any sort of sequestration towards their  targets to now allowing them to do so.  And that's really, I think, going to change the way that companies think about the potential  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:12:25):**  of agriculture exactly to meet their climate targets.  And so that's on the carbon potential.  And so just to what were some of the conclusions or what were some of the outcomes you saw  
**[0:12:40-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:12:40):**  out of that study and body of work?  Because what you did, I think, is look at, of course, a 20 year land, like the pieces  of land and the fields that they've been working on for 20 years.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:12:49):**  And I encourage anybody to go deeper into the work of wider pastures, because it's very,  very interesting, to say the least.  But you also looked at some newly acquired land, degraded land that they bought recently,  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:13:00):**  maybe five years ago, probably, and what how quickly that started to change.  And what did you see there in quite an advanced and complex regenerative or farm using regenerative  practices?  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:13:13):**  How fast were changes that you saw?  And how instrumental was that compared to the total emissions of the farm?  Because obviously, that's what Epic and General Mills wanted to know.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:13:21):**  Like does it stack up?  Is it is it relevant in our in what we emit?  And what is the potential of the sequestration basically?  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:13:30):**  Yeah, no, that's a great question.  And maybe that's a good time for me to just kind of explain how the soil sampling worked.  I'm not a soil scientist, we partnered with a soil scientist to handle all of the the  
**[0:13:46-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:13:46):**  sampling work.  So that was one thing that was unique about this study is other in other cases where people  are trying to quantify the soil carbon.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:13:56):**  A lot of times they're relying on models where they're collecting data inputs, they're plugging  those inputs into some sort of model.  That's then, you know, giving an estimate of what the soil carbon potential might be.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:14:10):**  For this study, we really wanted to the results to be as robust as possible.  So we did opt to take soil samples directly from the farm.  That comes with its own, you know, set of limitations and uncertainties that are different  
**[0:14:25-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:14:25):**  from modeling.  But it does give us a little bit more confidence in the results that we were seeing.  So there's two main approaches to kind of sampling soil carbon over time and understanding  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:14:40):**  those changes.  One is to basically take a sample in one year.  Wait a few years, take another sample, wait a few years, take another sample.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:14:50):**  Same spot, same depth, same time of year, same day.  Same everything.  Exactly.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:14:56):**  Exactly.  To the extent that that can be controlled.  If we had wanted to do that with white oak pastures, we would have had to have started  
**[0:15:03-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:15:03):**  this work 20 years ago.  So that was not a good option for this study.  Are there farms that have done that?  
**[0:15:10-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:15:10):**  Are there farms that have been doing, because that would be an amazing body of data basically.  Has somebody done that retrospective?  Just making sure we take, as we take a picture every year in some places just to follow or  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:15:25):**  a shot actually for a video or documentary, like the biggest little farm I think they  did for seven years in certain spots every year, the same shot at the same time, et cetera.  Have we taken any of those for the soil carbon site or that's been wishful thinking?  
**[0:15:38-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:15:38):**  Or maybe 20 years ago we weren't so much looking at that.  I'm pretty sure there are scientists who have looked at that.  But again, soil is so specific to the region, to the thing that scientists are trying to  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:15:53):**  study, whether it's an ecosystem, whether it's agriculture.  I don't know for sure, but I've definitely seen soil health lectures where they'll show  Gabe Brown's soil carbon data.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:16:09):**  He's one of the kind of US pioneers of Regen AG.  But I've definitely seen graphs that talk about his soil carbon data all the way back  to 1993.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:16:20):**  I think in Rothamsted actually, yeah, I've seen that as well.  And I think in Rothamsted in the UK, because for sure we'll get emails now, they have the  largest soil sample library and history book basically where I've been in that library  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:16:33):**  actually and it's absolutely stacked with soil samples going back, I think 160 years  or something on their research farm.  So there is something, and then of course you could now take some sampling and run it  
**[0:16:46-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:16:46):**  through the new sensors and labs we have.  So there's for sure ways to do it, but I don't think on these active farms, most people didn't  have the time nor the budgets and the research to do that on every field or every piece.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:16:58):**  Okay, so that's one approach which you couldn't do because you couldn't travel back 20 years.  So what's the other approach that you opted for?  Yeah, so the other approach is called a chronosequence approach.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:17:10):**  And in essence, it's substituting space for time.  And so the reason that this site was so well suited to a chronosequence approach was because  it had sort of its, when we were doing this study, the total farm acreage was I believe  
**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:17:29):**  around 3000 acres.  However, it had kind of started with a smaller amount of land and almost every year in the  last 20 years had acquired new land.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:17:43):**  So basically what that meant is we had some portions of the farm that had been under that  management practice for 20 years, and we had other portions of the farm that had just gotten  started.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:17:59):**  And so basically, I don't remember the exact years, but we were able to identify using  the kind of soil, there was like a soil database because we wanted to make sure when we were  sampling fields, we were sampling fields that had as similar soil profiles as possible.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:18:19):**  And we were basically able to identify, I think there was a year zero field that they  had just purchased, had not been under any sort of animal influence.  And then I think there was like a three, five, seven, and then like all the way up to 20  
**[0:18:36-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:18:36):**  year plots.  Exactly.  And so using the chronosequence is basically saying, let's pretend like this year zero  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:18:45):**  field is what the year 20 field started out as.  And basically then you can see that the year 20 field was storing a lot more carbon than  the year zero field.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:19:00):**  And that sort of assumes, and I know that's not true, that the exact management practices  stay the same.  How do you work with that as they learned, I think a lot into that past 20 years and  
**[0:19:12-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:19:12):**  have been adjusting their approach?  How do you adjust in the research basically that it's not every field has had the same  treatment for 20 years or 15 or five or 10?  
**[0:19:23-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:19:23):**  Yeah.  And I mean, that's where our goal as kind of the LCA practitioners was to really understand  directionally what is happening and get as close to a magnitude as possible.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:19:41):**  But yeah, if we had been doing this to advance soil science, we might have been a lot more  careful to say, okay, what was the exact management practice on the 20 year field?  How did that differ from the seven year field?  
**[0:19:56-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:19:56):**  What's different?  But overall, the things we were pretty confident in were that the original land use before  being converted to perennial pasture was pretty consistent.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:20:09):**  So in that region of Georgia, I think it was predominantly being the crop rotation was  something like wheat, peanut, corn and soy that were basically being grown in very chemical  intensive systems.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:20:26):**  A lot of erosion had occurred.  So you had very, very degraded land that they were starting with.  And then, yeah, we did see like there was quite a bit of variation in the soil carbon  
**[0:20:43-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:20:43):**  that was stored in each of the different fields.  And that's probably reflective of the fact that the management wasn't identical over  the last 20 years.  
**[0:20:53-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:20:53):**  But what we did see was a very strong directional trend line of the carbon sequestration.  And basically, that trend line was around five to six times higher than what would be  considered normal for grazing systems in that region of the US.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:21:12):**  Okay, so five to six times higher.  What does that mean in terms of potential of soil carbon sequestration?  In terms of what's the 5x or 6x here?  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:21:25):**  Yeah, so they were essentially drying down carbon five to six times faster using their  multi species, you know, rotational.  Compared to what we know now or compared to what is the standard of perennial grazing  
**[0:21:39-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:21:39):**  there and that's what we've been using in models as well.  So there were, does it suggest we're way off in terms of what we expect, what we calculated  until now?  
**[0:21:48-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:21:48):**  No, so that was compared to what the literature said was likely the potential rate of sequestration.  Of perennial pasture in that region of the US.  That was likely not integrating multi species and not doing the same adaptive grazing.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:22:10):**  That's a massive difference, like five to six times.  I mean, it depends what the starting point is, obviously.  But it's a very big difference.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:22:20):**  And then how did that lead into, because I saw the headlines and infographics of basically  claiming carbon negative beef.  And of course, they compared it to some plant based or let's say non beef burger once, which  
**[0:22:33-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:22:33):**  did it very well, did very well on the infographics.  But what was the quote unquote conclusion, because you can never conclude these things,  because then we're going to talk about the limitations and or let's say the possibilities  
**[0:22:44-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:22:44):**  of further research.  What did that lead to compared to the emission side?  Because of course, that was what you mentioned.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:22:50):**  We want to bring in the potential of sequestration into the normal work of LC-ASIS, which is  looking at the emission side of things.  How did those two stack up, basically?  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:23:00):**  Yeah, so there were two parts to the study.  One was that we did look at the entire farm when we were trying to capture the emissions.  And then because General Mills through Epic was sourcing beef from the farm, they wanted  
**[0:23:17-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:23:17):**  to understand specifically the footprint of that beef.  So we looked at the whole farm and then we looked at the beef footprint.  This is where some of the LCA jargon comes into play.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:23:29):**  But essentially, the way that you understand the beef emissions in the context of an entire  farm.  And I don't think I mentioned, but at the time, the farm had, they had beef, they had  
**[0:23:43-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:23:43):**  chicken for meat, they had egg layers.  They had pork, sheep, goat, duck, guinea fowl.  So they had quite a few species.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:23:55):**  So part of the challenge is untangling from a complex multi-species operation.  How do we understand what the beef footprint is in the context of that?  And in some ways, that's a bit of an arbitrary exercise.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:24:12):**  We used the best practice in LCA, which is essentially economic allocation.  And so all of the animals were contributing to the soil carbon sequestration that was  occurring on the farm and to the...  
**[0:24:26-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:24:26):**  But which one did what is obviously tricky.  Exactly.  Which one did what is a tricky question.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:24:34):**  So essentially what we did was from the entire farm, we were able to pretty cleanly separate  the beef only emissions because in our models, we were looking at things like, yeah, how  many head of cattle did they have?  
**[0:24:51-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:24:51):**  What were their age ranges?  What were, how much manure were they producing?  And what did the models say the emissions from that were?  
**[0:24:59-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:24:59):**  How much feed were they digesting?  And what did the models say were the emissions from that?  These are the same models that predicted the soil carbon potential where we're five to  
**[0:25:09-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:25:09):**  six times off.  So how do we know, let's say, do we need a lot more research also on that side of things?  Because I think a lot of this data comes from, not from these kinds of systems.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:25:20):**  So how do we...  Let's unpack that later.  So you were taking this into account now because I'm really wondering and I've seen more and  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:25:29):**  more, I wouldn't say suggestions, but a lot of this data on the methane side or the emissions  side comes from a CAFA operation.  So the factory farm side of things, which is a very different kind of approach, let's  
**[0:25:41-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:25:41):**  say the least if you have been in one compared to something like this.  And so we might be off by a factor X when we look at emissions and emission equivalent,  which probably makes all these infographics look really odd or weird if you had to go  
**[0:25:55-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:25:55):**  deeper into that.  So that's a side note.  But so you looked at all of that and then separate out the beef side because that went  
**[0:26:03-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:26:03):**  to Epic and that was of course what General Mills was interested in.  And then what was there basically a bit tricky, but still doable conclusion coming out of  that?  
**[0:26:15-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:26:15):**  Yep.  So then for the sequestration, we basically had the total sequestration, well, the rate  of sequestration, the annual rate of sequestration for the farm because an LCA typically looks  
**[0:26:27-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:26:27):**  at a single operating year.  We then looked at the total sequestration that occurred in that operating year that  we were looking at.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:26:36):**  And then through LCA best practice, we did economic allocation.  So basically that set that looks at all of the revenue that's being generated on the  farm.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:26:47):**  And then basically, if beef is say generating 50 percent of the revenue, it says 50 percent  of the sequestration can be allocated to beef.  So this isn't a perfect scientific way of doing it.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:27:02):**  But it is the industry best practice for when allocation needs to happen.  So basically the conclusion was that within our estimates, we do think that the net total  emissions for beef is likely negative.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:27:19):**  We'll probably touch on some of these uncertainties and error bars and things like that.  Yeah, because I saw a huge bar on methane and a very conservative number even on that,  which is very interesting.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:27:30):**  But let's say that if you look at the beef alone within the system, it seems like a carbon  negative, which is a positive thing.  Let's just be very clear here.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:27:39):**  A carbon negative footprint.  And then looking at the farm as a whole, it was a different outcome.  It was significantly less carbon, but not a carbon negative conclusion.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:27:51):**  Right.  Yeah.  So looking at the whole farm and I had to pull up the PowerPoint to remember this number,  
**[0:27:59-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:27:59):**  it looked like the soil carbon sequestration in that operating year was offsetting around  85 percent of the total farms emissions for that year.  Which is massive.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:28:11):**  Just even now we go into the uncertainties there.  So what would be I think that's a massive conclusion, a massive potential.  Was that a surprise to you?  
**[0:28:21-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:28:21):**  Did you know some of these?  What was when you first saw these results or when you were making these PowerPoints  to present this as well?  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:28:30):**  What was the biggest surprise you found in doing this research?  Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't say the results were surprising, but I think what was most exciting  is I was on the farm when the soil samples were being taken.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:28:45):**  And so we're going field to field.  We start with the kind of year zero, you know, the lower year fields and basically the soil  is it's bright red clay down there.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:28:58):**  And the year zero field had basically no dark topsoil on it.  It was just basically an all red clay core.  And we did meter deep cores.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:29:09):**  So this was like a truck going down a whole meter so you could see the, you know, the  different horizons, which was very cool.  By the time we got to the fields that had been under management for several years, all  
**[0:29:22-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:29:22):**  of a sudden you could visibly see the topsoil layer, the dark, rich, you know, organic matter  topsoil layer on top visibly growing.  And so, you know, by year 20 you had just a core with a significant, you could visibly  
**[0:29:41-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:29:41):**  tell with your eyes that the topsoil on this farm was increasing.  And we had somebody, we had Nicole Masters actually, that said you could smell it as  well.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:29:52):**  Like you can, even if we're not trained, like if you're not a farmer, et cetera, you can  smell the difference if your eyes closed between healthy soil and non-healthy soil.  But of course we can see it as well and you saw it.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:30:03):**  I believe it.  And that's the amazing thing about animals on pasture is you can go and enjoy the farm  and not be overwhelmed by the aromas that a lot of people consider to be not very pleasant.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:30:16):**  Our nose is a very strong sensor.  Yeah.  And good compost, good stuff doesn't smell.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:30:22):**  It smells earthy and very, there's something, that's a whole different discussion, but there's  something I think deep in there that suggests something that we generally like this earthy  smell and don't like the smell smell, let's say.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:30:37):**  Exactly.  But yeah, so what was, there was kind of the waiting period between when we sent the samples  off to the lab and we're kind of waiting to get the, you know, the quantification of carbon  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:30:52):**  for each sample back.  So it was very, very exciting to see those soil cores and what you could visibly see  as, you know, soil health improving throughout the 20 year chronosequence to finally translate  
**[0:31:08-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:31:08):**  that into, you know, what we thought was the sequestration rate at the farm and then to  visibly see how that stacked up to what a typical LCA would consider to be the emissions  side of the equation.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:31:25):**  So that was very exciting.  I don't know that I was surprised by the result.  I guess I was, you know, I think in many of these cases you're sort of fearing the worst.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:31:36):**  You're fearing that you're going to be working on a study.  Beef is already so controversial.  So you have all of these emissions and you're worried that the sequestration is going to  
**[0:31:46-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:31:46):**  be meaningless.  And if that's the case, you know, it's really becomes even more difficult to make the case  for regenerative agriculture, for livestock integration, for kind of rebuilding our ecosystems  
**[0:31:59-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:31:59):**  and reintegrating animals to the land.  But when we see these results, I think it does show some really good promise for what  the potential of using animals to restore degraded land could be from a carbon perspective.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:32:18):**  And to unpack another piece of that puzzle before we go to what can be improved or how  can we make these results much more robust, which sounds like we need to revisit the models  on the emission side as well.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:32:30):**  But there's in the paper, the final paper, there is this mention of it.  It all sounds super amazing and very interesting.  Significantly lower emissions are significantly lower total emissions when you count the sequestration,  
**[0:32:45-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:32:45):**  but it does require twice and a half times the land.  Can we unpack that a bit?  Like what leads to that?  
**[0:32:52-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:32:52):**  Because it's such a low input way.  It's intensive and extensive at the same time.  How can that lead to two and a half times more land?  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:33:00):**  Or how is that land calculated, let's say in other systems, which require an enormous  amount of land beyond that to mine the fertilizer, etc.  How does that stack up if we look at the two and a half times?  
**[0:33:11-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:33:11):**  Should we be really worried?  Can we still feed the world with these things?  I mean, I think many people when they saw it was like, oh, OK, this is going to be an  
**[0:33:17-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:33:17):**  argument that's going to be used against, let's say, region ag quite strongly.  What is your response to when somebody said, yes, but it uses two and a half times more  land and we can't have that because we have to feed the world?  
**[0:33:31-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:33:31):**  Yeah.  And I mean, there could be a whole podcast episode on this question itself.  But I think a few thoughts are that, you know, a, this type of system has the opportunity  
**[0:33:44-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:33:44):**  to use marginal land that would otherwise not be croppable.  And if you're not able to grow crops on a certain piece of land, that land wouldn't  be able to support, you know, growing animal feed, for example, for confined animals.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:34:03):**  In the US, I think the majority of our land is actually kind of pasture and rangeland,  most of which is unsuitable for growing crops.  So there is there is an opportunity to add a little bit more nuance to the discussion  
**[0:34:20-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:34:20):**  about where is this appropriate from a land use perspective, where is this maybe not appropriate  from a land use perspective?  But I think that the other sort of thing to unpack is that, I mean, I focus mostly on  
**[0:34:34-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:34:34):**  the US context, but we have we have quite a bit of cropland that is not actually growing  food for people to eat, to consume directly.  And so, you know, somehow we've gotten to a point where we have somewhere between, you  
**[0:34:52-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:34:52):**  know, 300 to 400 million acres of cropland in the US and, you know, for scale, a country  like Switzerland is 10 million acres.  So we're we're talking about quite a bit of quite a bit of cropland in the US.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:35:07):**  And, you know, somehow 70 percent of that land is basically growing just two crops.  Seven zero, just for this is seven zero, not one seven.  It's massive.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:35:17):**  It's seven zero, 70 percent of our US cropland is pretty much growing just two crops.  And a large majority of those two crops are going into livestock feed now because of the  efficiencies that have come with, you know, things like synthetic fertilizer.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:35:41):**  We have been able to increase yields of those crops to the point and that along with the,  you know, the animal genetics where now we have animals that, you know, I think a Cornish  cross chicken grows to market weight in six weeks or something like that.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:36:01):**  So we have incredibly efficient animal genetics, incredibly efficient, you know, corn and soy  farming that basically combined, you know, when you when you confine all the animals  to a small space gives a very, very small land footprint.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:36:19):**  However, that small land footprint is not without consequence.  So for example, we have nitrate pollution pretty much everywhere in the US in the groundwater.  Part of that is from the fertilizer runoff for growing the feed so intensively.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:36:38):**  Part of that is from manure runoff from the the livestock, the confined livestock operations.  There are air pollution concerns as well with with confined animals kind of going back to  the aroma that apparently can be smelled for for miles away.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:36:58):**  So it's you know, it's one of those things where I think land is worth a much more nuanced  conversation about, you know, what how should we be using our land?  What should we be growing out of our cropland acres in the US?  
**[0:37:14-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:37:14):**  I think less than one percent is growing, you know, fruits and vegetables and nuts and  things like that.  A lot of it is really going towards growing the animal feed.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:37:28):**  So yeah, I think there's more to unpack there than just it uses two and a half times more  land.  Yeah, I think it's there's there's the question which you raised at the beginning.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:37:37):**  What kind of what kind of land?  Second, if we take an old land into consideration, plastics and alloties.  OK, that's a whole different discussion.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:37:45):**  And also, like, is that land of all the feed and ethanol, which is another huge issue that  the land is there, let's say.  It's just not used to grow food in many cases.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:37:58):**  It's used to grow feed or fuel.  And both of that should stop immediately.  And this does seem to suggest that there is especially the multi species and holistic  
**[0:38:09-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:38:09):**  grazing or adaptive grazing, whatever we want to call it, for sure getting emails about this  as well, but is a very intensive way of producing quite a lot of calories.  Like, did you compare that as well?  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:38:21):**  Like what this size farm almost per hectare per acre produces compared to the neighbors  in Georgia that are producing maybe the wheat corn rotation that you were mentioning before?  Like compared to the neighbors, the amount of calories that people actually eat and why  
**[0:38:36-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:38:36):**  to pass is is producing must be completely off the chart compared to neighbors and not  taking in a lot of inputs because they are very input low.  Do they import a lot?  
**[0:38:45-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:38:45):**  Like, does the system as a farm there for at a farm level need a lot of things coming  into the farm or is it mostly quote unquote self-sufficient?  Like what inputs do they do they bring onto the farm?  
**[0:38:56-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:38:56):**  What if you which you obviously counted as well into the RCA?  Yeah, so the answer to your first question is we didn't look at like a calorie per calorie  basis.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:39:06):**  I think that's also a very nuanced conversation.  And we need to look at the nutrients in the calories.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:39:14):**  But in terms of the inputs for the farm, the the beef, sheep and goats were almost self-sufficient,  like 100 percent grass fed.  They were bringing in some minerals.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:39:28):**  So ruminants typically need they had a mobile mineral bar and then, you know, the cows and  the animals know exactly what their body needs.  And so that's a very, very small input.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:39:41):**  But otherwise, for the hogs and the poultry, those are monogastrics.  So they can't at least the species that we've bred right now, they can't survive on just  the grass alone.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:39:57):**  So they were bringing in feed for those animals.  So grains.  But otherwise, I think those were the major inputs.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:40:10):**  You know, there's a little bit of fuel for them running their own for running their their  trucks and being able to get around the 3000 acres.  I have it right here.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:40:25):**  Poultry and pig feed, the mineral bar.  Oh, the year kind of zero and one fields.  They were seeding those fields with with grass seed or the mix of their grass seed in the  
**[0:40:40-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:40:40):**  first few years.  And then once it was seeded, they weren't doing any more of that.  And then it was fuel, electricity and water.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:40:49):**  So pretty.  Yeah, the poultry and the pigs are hard because they do they do require the external feed.  But the ruminants were almost self-sufficient.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:41:03):**  So would that then suggest if the non-ruminants are first of all needing inputs and maybe  because of that, and we'll get into the models later, but are not the biggest contributor,  let's say to the soil carbon side or to the they are a big contributor to the emission  
**[0:41:20-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:41:20):**  side, would you then suggest obviously not making farm suggestions to to get rid of that  part of the system and keep the ruminants that clearly can survive on grass itself after  the seeding, obviously, and after transition period?  
**[0:41:34-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:41:34):**  Or is that just a very simplistic reductionist way of looking at some of this data?  Yeah, no, this is that's an excellent question.  And I think that the important thing to remember is that the LCA is an oversimplified model  
**[0:41:52-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:41:52):**  of what is happening on the farm.  And in our case, we were looking at a single component, which was the the carbon and the  greenhouse gas emissions coming from the farm.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:42:04):**  Whereas when you when you visit the farm, when you hear Will Harris talk about the systems  and the cycles that he's recreating, it becomes very apparent that having the multi species  is a really important part of the operation.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:42:20):**  There are still things we're learning about how to best manage for livestock parasites,  which can live in the soil for years and years and years, and actually having multiple species  and especially the chickens help to kind of scratch the chickens, follow the cows, they  
**[0:42:40-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:42:40):**  kind of help to scratch and incorporate some of the manure.  They eat the fly larvae that is growing in the manure.  So they decrease the fly population, which can be quite a nuisance when you have livestock.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:42:54):**  They're getting some additional feed and protein from eating that larvae.  And there's some evidence that having the multi species can help to reduce the parasite  loads as well within the pastures.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:43:06):**  So we do know anecdotally and depending on what the field of study is, that there are  innumerable benefits to having multiple species.  That's the other thing is different species eat different grasses that are growing on  
**[0:43:22-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:43:22):**  the pasture.  So the cows are going to have the things they like.  The goats are going to have the things they like.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:43:27):**  The chickens are going to have the things they like.  So you kind of have a more balanced, healthier, more biodiverse pasture as well if you have  the multi species.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:43:39):**  The question on feed is that kind of goes down an interesting rabbit hole because what  you're optimizing for determines kind of the approach to the solutions.  So for example, if we're optimizing for the most efficient CO2 equivalent animal protein,  
**[0:44:01-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:44:01):**  pork and chicken typically end up being much more CO2 equivalent efficient compared to  beef because of the methane emissions.  However, if you were trying to optimize for something like farming that's free of fossil  
**[0:44:18-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:44:18):**  fuels, all of a sudden the ruminants are probably going to have the biggest potential to achieve  that.  And that's where I think as we're sort of moving towards better understanding the role  
**[0:44:29-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:44:29):**  that agriculture plays in both climate change but also in the potential to help producers  adapt and potentially mitigate climate change, the conversation is going to evolve as to  how we want to prioritize our different land use, animal protein, what we grow for annual  
**[0:44:50-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:44:50):**  crops, et cetera, et cetera.  Yeah, I think that's an excellent point that many people forget.  And so what needs to happen, let's say on the other side of the equation, you mostly  
**[0:45:03-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:45:03):**  look now at the potential and the sequestration side of the LCA that has been missing until  now and luckily other people are working on that as well.  How do we bring the positive potential to an LCA and to this kind of research?  
**[0:45:17-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:45:17):**  But then looking at the other side, what we've been mentioning as well is that a lot of these  models on methane, a lot of these models on emissions are models and don't reflect what  has been happening on these kind of pioneering farms.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:45:31):**  So do you see that work is needed to make these LCA is more robust also on the, let's  say the emission side?  And if so, what needs to happen there, what would be interesting research projects to  
**[0:45:44-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:45:44):**  make the emission side more robust as well and not based on potentially outdated, maybe  not, but potentially outdated models?  Yeah, no, this is something I think about a lot in my line of work where there's a saying,  
**[0:45:59-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:45:59):**  I think it's something like all models are wrong, most are useless.  And I think that applies very much to LCA as well, where the original goal of LCA was  to pretty much help companies understand where the emissions hotspots were over an entire  
**[0:46:19-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:46:19):**  life cycle.  So the goal was to take a holistic approach to look at all elements of production from,  if we take agriculture as an example, the upstream production of fertilizers, all of  
**[0:46:34-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:46:34):**  the transportation of those fertilizers to the farm.  When you get to on farm, you're looking at the application of those fertilizers, emissions  associated with that, emissions associated with-  
**[0:46:46-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:46:46):**  Which are massive on methane and nitrogen and all kinds of other emissions.  Exactly.  It's a hot bat.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:46:55):**  Exactly, and then after the farm gate, looking at what's needed to convert, say, wheat into  wheat flour, how much fuel and energy and then how much energy does it take to transport  all that flour to General Mills or whichever company is using it.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:47:12):**  So the original goal was to understand the hotspots that were occurring across an entire  sort of life cycle approach.  The challenge is that we're now moving from a point in time in which companies wanted  
**[0:47:28-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:47:28):**  to understand the hotspots and the areas of opportunity to companies wanting or, I guess,  needing to quantify their emissions in a much more accurate way.  And that's been a really kind of difficult thing because pretty much all of the databases  
**[0:47:48-0:47:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:47:48):**  that we rely on to do our LCA assessments, they're based on generic data.  And a lot of times it's looking at data at, say, the country level.  So for example, it might have a data set that's wheat grown in the US, but there's not a data  
**[0:48:05-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:48:05):**  set that's wheat grown using regenerative practices or wheat grown using irrigation  or wheat grown in Georgia versus Kansas.  So the LCA's that we have been relying on, they give us essentially an estimate, but  
**[0:48:23-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:48:23):**  not a very accurate picture of what would actually be reflected on a specific farm or  a specific operation.  And I think this is where a lot of the tension is, is that because of that, we have a lot  
**[0:48:39-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:48:39):**  of groups that are focused right now on improving the accounting and improving the methodology  development, basically to try and make the numbers more accurate to kind of reduce the  uncertainty and the error bars that are associated with those LCA's.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:48:58):**  But I think what's interesting here is that we're sort of at a stage where because we've  had so much LCA work done on different food and ag products in different countries, we're  at a stage where we really know what drives farm level emissions.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:49:17):**  And from a soil health perspective, we're learning new things every day, but we also  have a general idea of what practices are going to lead to improved soil health.  But the challenge that I see in my industry is I think we're getting very caught up in  
**[0:49:32-0:49:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:49:32):**  trying to figure out how to quantify those emissions better, as opposed to focusing on  how do we make the changes that we know that we need to see.  So an example is that our nitrogen cycle right now is completely out of whack.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:49:49):**  And ideally, we would focus on figuring out how do we get those nutrient management plans  in place so that we don't have nitrates building up in our groundwater and in our surface water.  We also know from a climate change perspective that we need to figure out how to eliminate  
**[0:50:06-0:50:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:50:06):**  the fossil carbon from agriculture.  That's both for the on-farm fuel in tractors and equipment, but also for the production  of say synthetic nitrogen fertilizer.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:50:19):**  So there are things that we know we could focus on that would help agriculture align  to what is needed to be aligned with the 1.5 degree future, and yet there's a lot of time  and energy going into arguing about methodological improvements and especially things like the  
**[0:50:41-0:50:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:50:41):**  permanence of soil carbon, which is a pretty interesting topic.  So what would you tell, let's say we're in a theater, I always like to use this example  because I hope we imagine listening to this wherever you are listening, could be on a  
**[0:50:58-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:50:58):**  tractor, on a horse, on the land, it could be somewhere in a commute, et cetera.  But imagine we're in a nice old theater and we're on stage and we're doing this in person  and the room is full of investors or people working in finance.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:51:12):**  What would you tell them, obviously without giving investment advice, but to focus on  in this field of work when they walk out of that theater in the evening and say, okay,  tomorrow morning I'm going to dig deeper into XYZ.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:51:27):**  What would you tell them?  What are interesting places to start digging deeper and to understand more of this potential,  but also the challenges and opportunities of let's say the LCA work or the measurement  
**[0:51:40-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:51:40):**  and trying to quantify these things?  Which direction would you give them?  Oh, I have so many thoughts.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:51:48):**  But maybe I'll start with what I think investors really should be or anyone working in the  space should really be cautious about.  And I think that's being really cautious about carbon as a topic and in particular soil carbon  
**[0:52:05-0:52:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:52:05):**  sequestration.  I think in many ways what's happening with soil carbon sequestration and the associated  work to develop carbon models and accounting is really taking a reductionist view of something  
**[0:52:21-0:52:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:52:21):**  that is actually part of a much more complex carbon cycle.  For example, there's the temporal element.  In order to be able to account for soil carbon sequestration, we have to pick an arbitrary  
**[0:52:34-0:52:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:52:34):**  point in time as a baseline state.  Now that baseline state is usually representing a very recent state rather than a historic  state.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:52:46):**  So basically when we restore soil health and sequester carbon, a lot of times it's happening  on degraded lands, at least in the US.  So essentially what we're doing is we're putting the carbon back that was lost from that land  
**[0:53:00-0:53:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:53:00):**  over the last several decades of soil degrading agricultural practices.  So setting a baseline of degraded lands where you then have a huge potential to put back  the soil carbon and then trying to sell that carbon as, say, offsets for companies to continue  
**[0:53:19-0:53:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:53:19):**  emitting I would say is it's a little bit questionable and it's definitely not aligned  with what's needed to achieve a 1.5C future.  And I think the other really interesting element is that when we try and account for soil carbon  
**[0:53:35-0:53:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:53:35):**  sequestration, we're basically limiting soil carbon sequestration to a mere subtraction  of carbon from the atmosphere.  And we're kind of ignoring the whole complex carbon cycle that's associated with that.  
**[0:53:48-0:53:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:53:48):**  So in a healthy carbon cycle, the goal is not to lock up that carbon permanently and  store it in the ground, which I think has largely been the focus of, say, soil carbon  markets.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:54:00):**  But it's really to put that carbon to work as the lifeblood of our ecosystems.  And so I think ruminants are a really good example where you have grass that's pulling  carbon down from the atmosphere as it grows.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:54:13):**  Ruminants can consume this grass.  In turn, that tells the grass to keep growing, keep sending those sugars down to their roots.  And in the process, the animals depositing manure, which is helping to feed the soil  
**[0:54:28-0:54:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:54:28):**  microbes, it's helping to put carbon in the soil as well.  And humans can't digest that grass.  Ruminants can because they have those special microbes in their rumen.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:54:42):**  And there is an associated release of methane from that.  But methane is a short-lived climate pollutant.  So basically it stays in the atmosphere for around 12 years before it then breaks down  
**[0:54:56-0:55:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:54:56):**  back into CO2 and H2O, which again are the building blocks for more grass.  And so the cycle then begins again.  And I think there's really a danger in separating all of those pieces out because then you get  
**[0:55:12-0:55:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:55:12):**  the kind of conventional thinking of methane is bad, soil carbon is good, which leads to  people trying to figure out ways of minimizing methane and maximizing soil carbon sequestration.  But oftentimes with solutions that continue to perpetuate distancing animals from the  
**[0:55:32-0:55:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:55:32):**  land.  And so I think really smart investors and people working in this space should realize  that our goal should be to better understand what is a healthy carbon cycle, where are  
**[0:55:47-0:55:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:55:47):**  our carbon cycles currently broken, and how can we restore the balance of carbon going  into the atmosphere and carbon coming back out in a way where it's constantly flowing  through the food system.  
**[0:56:03-0:56:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:56:03):**  So that's kind of the way that I like to think about this space is how do we really move  from soil carbon sequestration being just a single piece of the puzzle, one half of  the equation, to how do we invest in restoring and rebalancing broken cycles, which are going  
**[0:56:23-0:56:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:56:23):**  to be much more long term, deeply rooted solutions to I think many of our agricultural problems  right now.  So what would you do if you would be in charge of a large investment fund or a large investment  
**[0:56:36-0:56:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:56:36):**  portfolio, let's say a billion dollars?  What would you focus on in terms of investments?  How would you put, how and where would you put money to work if tomorrow morning you  
**[0:56:48-0:56:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:56:48):**  would be in charge of a considerable sum of money with complete freedom of how to put  that to work?  Obviously as in that or not obviously as investments, but the time horizon could be 20, 30, 50 or  
**[0:57:00-0:57:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:57:00):**  200 years.  What would you focus on?  Where would you where would you start?  
**[0:57:05-0:57:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:57:05):**  What would you prioritize if you had, I wouldn't say unlimited, but almost unlimited resources?  Yeah, I mean, for me personally, as someone who works at the intersection of kind of climate  change and agriculture, what I would invest in is really fossil free farming, investing  
**[0:57:23-0:57:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:57:23):**  in ideas and creative solutions that basically get the fossil fuels that are embedded in  our conventional agricultural system completely phased out ideally by 2050 at the latest,  ideally sooner.  
**[0:57:41-0:57:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:57:41):**  But ultimately, for agriculture to be aligned with the 1.5C future, we basically have to  find ways to phase out all of the embedded fossil fuels.  I think I mentioned a lot of this is in the synthetic fertilizer production.  
**[0:57:57-0:58:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:57:57):**  A lot of this is in the on farm tractor fuel and energy.  There's quite a bit in transport as well.  And most people don't realize that the carbon footprint of row crops, at least in the US,  
**[0:58:11-0:58:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:58:11):**  is typically more than 50 percent from fossil fuels.  And so that comes mostly.  I mean, is that then is there an 80 20 there as well as like is it the mostly fertilizer  
**[0:58:23-0:58:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:58:23):**  or mostly tractors?  It's pretty much 50 50.  Wow.  
**[0:58:28-0:58:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:58:28):**  Fifty fifty.  Electric tractors make sense and focusing on all the bio fertilizers, stimulants and  everything and how to produce massive amounts of high quality compost, et cetera, should  
**[0:58:39-0:58:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:58:39):**  get equal attention in your in your fund.  Exactly, exactly.  And I think what's happening right now is, you know, soil carbon, soil carbon sequestration.  
**[0:58:50-0:58:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:58:50):**  It's having its day in the sun right now.  But when we think about specifically the climate ROI, finding ways to invest in phasing out  the fossil carbon of agriculture is going to have a much higher climate return on investment  
**[0:59:06-0:59:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:59:06):**  than storing carbon in the soil.  There are definitely benefits to increasing soil carbon stocks.  We absolutely should be doing that.  
**[0:59:16-0:59:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:59:16):**  But really, when we're thinking about this, you know, Paris Agreement, this global goal  of trying to limit warming to one point five C, then we need fossil fuels to be phased  out and soil carbon to be sequestered.  
**[0:59:28-0:59:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:59:28):**  But they're not interchangeable.  So we can't just use soil carbon to offset our agricultural fossil carbon emissions.  And I think that's where that's where I see a big opportunity, because right now, the  
**[0:59:44-0:59:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:59:44):**  way that LCA is are presented, they combine all of the different agricultural greenhouse  gases into that single metric of CO2 equivalents.  But if we start dividing out the sources,  
**[0:59:57-1:00:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:59:57):**  Now we get to a whole different podcast, but yeah, I'm absolutely listening because this  is fascinating.  No, no, it's I think it's one of those huge issues.  
**[1:00:04-1:00:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:00:04):**  We put everything on their equivalent and they're not equivalent.  Like methane is 12 years and is a building block for other stuff.  Exactly.  
**[1:00:11-1:00:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:00:11):**  So when we start splitting that, like what would it look like?  And what would you focus on then?  Yeah, so when we start splitting it, that's when we realize just how significant the fossil  
**[1:00:22-1:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:00:22):**  carbon portion of the emissions are to agriculture.  But also, you know, one of the really key elements is that, you know, methane and nitrous  oxide, they are biogenic emissions.  
**[1:00:39-1:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:00:39):**  They're emissions that are an inherent part of our ecosystems.  You know, even if we didn't have any humans living on Earth, we would still have methane  emissions.  
**[1:00:48-1:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:00:48):**  We would still have N2O emissions.  Whereas, so there's the biogenic carbon cycle, there's the fossil carbon cycle, and they  need to be treated differently.  
**[1:00:58-1:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:00:58):**  And that's because, you know, as we think about what's needed to achieve a 1.5 degree  future, we still need deep reductions in methane and N2O.  But the goal is not to fully eliminate methane and N2O.  
**[1:01:14-1:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:01:14):**  The goal is to make sure that...  Stop burning dinosaur bones.  Yeah, that's the...  
**[1:01:19-1:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:01:19):**  Exactly.  Exactly.  So that's why it's really important that they're treated differently.  
**[1:01:24-1:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:01:24):**  And you know, why there's sort of a danger to the oversimplification of LCA's in the  agricultural space using CO2 equivalent.  And the analogy that I like to use is, you know, if you went to your doctor and you said,  
**[1:01:40-1:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:01:40):**  I need help making sure that I have a healthy balanced diet.  If your doctor basically told you just count the number of calories that you're eating,  you would probably be a little bit skeptical because you'd probably dive deeper and say,  
**[1:01:53-1:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:01:53):**  well, how much protein should I be eating?  How much fat should I be eating?  How much carbohydrate should I be eating?  
**[1:01:59-1:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:01:59):**  And if all they say is calories, then you would probably try and find another doctor.  And I think it's similar for LCA and agriculture and climate change where the predominant way  we've been thinking about things is sort of CO2 equivalent as basically the calorie metric,  
**[1:02:17-1:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:02:17):**  where it combines everything into one metric that looks clean, I guess, on a nutrition  label.  But if you dig a little bit deeper, you realize that we have different targets for methane.  
**[1:02:30-1:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:02:30):**  We have different targets for nitrous oxide, and we have different targets for fossil carbon.  And if we want a healthy balanced carbon cycle, a healthy balanced nitrogen cycle, and ultimately,  you know, a climate that's not unsafe for a lot of our populations, we need to start  
**[1:02:50-1:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:02:50):**  digging deeper and tracking progress towards those individual targets and start to move  away from the oversimplified CO2 equivalent metric.  And would that be, this is a perfect bridge to the magic wand question I like to ask,  
**[1:03:05-1:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:03:05):**  if you can change one thing in agriculture and food or in LCA in general or in the sustainability  space or regenerative space, so you're no longer in charge of your fund, but if you  would be able to change one thing overnight, what would that be?  
**[1:03:20-1:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:03:20):**  Yeah, I thought a lot about this question because there are quite a few areas that would  be interesting to see change in.  But I think what I came up with is that if I could change just one thing, it would be  
**[1:03:34-1:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:03:34):**  a collective societal agreement that we will no longer tolerate agricultural pollution.  So at least, you know, in the US context, all across the US, we have groundwater that's  polluted with nitrates.  
**[1:03:48-1:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:03:48):**  That's not only a health hazard for people, but it's also quite costly.  The water treatment plants to remove these nitrates could run a small rural town of 700  people, something like $2.4 million to install.  
**[1:04:05-1:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:04:05):**  And we have dead zones.  Let's say it's cheaper to pay farmers to change practices, I think.  It would be much cheaper to do some preventative.  
**[1:04:15-1:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:04:15):**  Like usually, also in health care, that's the same.  It's funny how that works.  It's funny how that works.  
**[1:04:19-1:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:04:19):**  Yeah, I read an article recently that said, you know, even if every farmer in the US stopped  fertilizing tomorrow, it could take decades for the nitrates that are already in our US  groundwater to actually dissipate.  
**[1:04:32-1:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:04:32):**  So that's groundwater.  We have dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico, in the Chesapeake Bay.  It's really wreaking havoc on our ecosystems.  
**[1:04:41-1:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:04:41):**  And it's very disappointing when water is unsafe to swim or to fish from due to agricultural  pollution.  So I think we're kind of at a stage where, in many cases, the pollution that is directly  
**[1:04:57-1:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:04:57):**  tied to agriculture is it's incompatible with having life and thriving ecosystems and thriving  communities.  And I think if we were at a point where if we could collectively agree as a society that  
**[1:05:15-1:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:05:15):**  we were no longer willing to tolerate those nitrates in our groundwater, to tolerate having  dead zones, unsafe drinking water, unsafe fishing and recreational water, I think that  would go a long way towards changing the agricultural landscape, how we manage our land, what we  
**[1:05:32-1:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:05:32):**  grow, et cetera, et cetera.  And as a final question, I mean, you mentioned a few things, but maybe there's something  that really stands out.  
**[1:05:43-1:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:05:43):**  What do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture that others don't?  This is definitely inspired by a question that Jon Kempf always asks or usually asks.  I listened recently to see if he still asks this.  
**[1:05:53-1:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:05:53):**  But what do you believe to be true?  Where are you contrarian?  Yeah, I mean, it's always hard to know who's thinking what in this space because it's so  
**[1:06:04-1:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:06:04):**  big.  In my opinion, I think we're really only scratching the surface of what regenerative agriculture  could be.  
**[1:06:12-1:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:06:12):**  Now, this is speaking from someone who's coming at this from the corporate regenerative agriculture  side of things.  And I think a big part of this is to do with potentially confusing what is a basic best  
**[1:06:24-1:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:06:24):**  practice for managing soil health and agricultural pollution, such as erosion and runoff, with  regenerative practices.  So, I've seen proposals for regenerative agriculture pilot projects, corporate funded pilot projects  
**[1:06:42-1:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:06:42):**  that focus solely on, say, a single practice like cover cropping, and that's called regenerative  agriculture.  Now, I'm pretty sure the NRCS in the US has been trying to promote cover cropping for  
**[1:06:53-1:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:06:53):**  the last 50 years as just a basic best practice for soil health.  Another example is that livestock integration gets talked about a lot as a basic principle  of regenerative agriculture.  
**[1:07:09-1:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:07:09):**  And yet, most of the corporate pilots related to regenerative agriculture are focused on  growing feed regeneratively while still keeping those animals distanced from the land.  Which I think that's a really-  
**[1:07:23-1:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:07:23):**  Sort of cutting your off from all the potential that we just discussed for the last hour plus.  Yeah.  Exactly.  
**[1:07:30-1:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:07:30):**  And that begs quite an interesting question that I think is being danced around right  now in the RegenAg space, which is around what is the role of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer  in regenerative agriculture?  
**[1:07:43-1:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:07:43):**  Because RegenAg, most people are talking about it in terms of farming in harmony with nature.  We do have several early adopter pioneer examples.  I think Gabe Brown said he hasn't been using synthetic nitrogen fertilizer for almost two  
**[1:07:57-1:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:07:57):**  decades now.  And that's through animal integration and very careful rebalancing of the carbon and  nitrogen cycles and the soil biology within his operations.  
**[1:08:11-1:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:08:11):**  But I have yet to see a corporate funded regenerative agriculture pilot with a stated goal of either  deeply reducing or eliminating synthetic nitrogen fertilizer.  And then I think one last thought I had on this question is that our food system as a  
**[1:08:29-1:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:08:29):**  whole really has quite a few large cracks.  So for example, when you go to, at least in the US, if you go to the supermarket in the  middle of winter and pick up one pound of tomatoes, you can think about the fact that  
**[1:08:45-1:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:08:45):**  the farm worker was likely paid on the order of a single penny to pick that pound of tomatoes.  And I think regenerative agriculture could give us an opportunity to start to address  some of these cracks.  
**[1:09:00-1:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:09:00):**  But in order to do that, we have to really acknowledge that they're there.  And I think the current RegenAg landscape is sort of dancing around the cracks or the  fissures in our food system and just trying to come up with solutions that take our existing  
**[1:09:15-1:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:09:15):**  system and turn it regenerative.  But I think what's cool is in Japan, they have a term called kintsugi, which is basically  where they repair cracked pottery with gold.  
**[1:09:29-1:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:09:29):**  And then I think that piece becomes even more valuable.  The cracked piece becomes even more valuable.  And I see an opportunity to do that here with regenerative agriculture where we can start  
**[1:09:41-1:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:09:41):**  a somewhat uncomfortable dialogue that acknowledges where some of these, and brings to light where  some of these cracks are so that we can find collaborative ways of sealing them back up  in a way that really brings kind of long-term deep-rooted solutions as opposed to potentially  
**[1:10:04-1:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:10:04):**  more shallow-rooted, not holistic solutions to a lot of the problems that we face in our  agriculture and food systems.  I think it's a perfect end and a perfect metaphor.  
**[1:10:18-1:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:10:18):**  I mean, there are very uncomfortable cracks in this agriculture system and we need to  have a deep look at how we got to such an extractive system in many places, not just  a few decades, but a few millennia.  
**[1:10:30-1:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:10:30):**  And I just finished a book.  It should be on the podcast soon, hopefully, Healing Grounds of Liz Carlyle, her latest  book, which I'll put in links below as well in the show notes.  
**[1:10:40-1:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:10:40):**  And we really have to face the social side, but also the land ownership side, the non-diversity  side, globally, the indigenous side, the access to food side.  I mean, there are many uncomfortable, but I think absolutely essential cracks to talk  
**[1:10:56-1:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:10:56):**  about because otherwise, as I think it was Lauren Tucker saying of Renourish Studio,  if we keep talking about soil health and focus everything on soil health, that's what we're  going to get, healthier soil and not fix any of the other things that we very uncomfortably  
**[1:11:11-1:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:11:11):**  got ourselves into.  I'm not blaming anybody.  We all did this.  
**[1:11:14-1:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:11:14):**  We're part of this.  But it is definitely a system that needs a bit more than a few cover crops here and there  and a few extra animals on the land and a bit of compost, and then we'll all be fine.  
**[1:11:25-1:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:11:25):**  This is a much deeper and it does a much longer transition that we need to be ready to get  uncomfortable.  I agree.  
**[1:11:33-1:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:11:33):**  I agree.  And so I want to thank you for that.  We can go in 10 other directions for another hour, but I want to be conscious of your time  
**[1:11:40-1:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:11:40):**  and of the listeners.  But this means we need to have you back at some point.  And thank you so much for the work you do for explaining the magical, interesting, challenging  
**[1:11:48-1:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:11:48):**  world of LCA's.  And thank you for coming on and sharing about it.  Anytime.  
**[1:11:54-1:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:11:54):**  Happy to be here.  Thank you so much for listening all the way to the end.  For the show notes and links discussed, check out our website investinginregionaryagriculture.com

**[1:12:25-1:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:12:25):**  That really helps.  Thanks again and see you next time.  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[1:12:47-1:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:12:47):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  
**[1:12:57-1:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:12:57):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  to work in regenerating soils and have been following this space since 2011 and recording  this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[1:13:11-1:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:13:11):**  What have we seen in this space over the last years?  How have we built our decision making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[1:13:18-1:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:13:18):**  How have we picked interviewees?  What questions should you ask?  What is happening in this space?  
**[1:13:24-1:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:13:24):**  What should you read?  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  
**[1:13:28-1:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:13:28):**  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course?  To the soil builders and investors in this space.  
**[1:13:34-1:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:13:34):**  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management, consultants, etc.  
**[1:13:49-1:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:13:49):**  People that are building soil at scale.  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[1:13:59-1:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:13:59):**  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  Is this course free?  No.  
**[1:14:06-1:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:14:06):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with very different  
**[1:14:17-1:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:14:17):**  means.  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[1:14:26-1:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:14:26):**  Thank you.  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[1:14:34-1:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:14:34):**  so you don't have to ride along.  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to

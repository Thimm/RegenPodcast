**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:00:16):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:20-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:00:20):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:00:21):**  A podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:00:26):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:00:31):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:00:36):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:00:38):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:00:42):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:00:44):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:00:49):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:00:54):**  In March last year, we launched our Patreon community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:01:20):**  So welcome to this podcast, regenerative agriculture investing in agriculture as if the planet  
**[0:01:24-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:01:24):**  mattered.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:01:25):**  I started doing these podcasts because I noticed that I was having quite some, at least for  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:01:30):**  me, interesting conversations around investing in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:01:34):**  And every time after the conversation was finished, I thought, why didn't I record this  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:01:39):**  so I could actually share it with others who are interested in this space?  
**[0:01:43-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:01:43):**  I'm Kun von Saehe.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:01:44):**  I'm a senior manager at Tonic, where we work with a community of impact investors.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:01:49):**  And in my spare time, I record these interviews.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:01:52):**  So why regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:01:54):**  Because so many of the current issues we face as a world come together in this sector and  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:01:59):**  impact investing for me offers a way to scale the sector and reach the potential it has.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:02:04):**  In these interviews, I'm talking to people who are trying to scale up the regenerative  
**[0:02:08-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:02:08):**  agriculture side, either by increasing the inflow of capital into the sector or by increasing  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:02:14):**  the impact on the ground and scaling up the enterprises on the ground.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:02:19):**  You're going to listen to an interview with Paul McMahon, co-founder of SLM Partners.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:02:23):**  We discussed a lot of things in this interview, among them their current projects in Australia,  
**[0:02:30-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:02:30):**  who are benefiting from a good year of rain, and the new projects in Ireland and Chile.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:02:36):**  We also spent some time with the White Paper.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:02:39):**  He wrote about ecological farming and the investment case, looking at the main risks  
**[0:02:43-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:02:43):**  for the current farming industry and the main opportunities and barriers that are slowly  
**[0:02:50-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:02:50):**  being taken away, luckily.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:02:52):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:02:54):**  I'm here today with Paul McMahon, co-founder and managing partner of SLM Partners, an asset  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:02:59):**  manager that acquires and manages rural land on behalf of institutional investors to scale  
**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:04):**  up regenerative ecological farming and forestry systems that deliver financial returns and  
**[0:03:10-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:10):**  environmental benefits.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:12):**  He's also the writer of a white paper called The Investment Case for Ecological Farming.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:16):**  Very warm welcome, Paul.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:17):**  Thank you for joining us.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:19):**  Thank you.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:20):**  I would like to start with why are you in this business and how did you end up here?  
**[0:03:28-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:28):**  I think we see land at the center of a number of overlapping and increasingly important  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:36):**  environmental issues.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:39):**  For example, climate change, land is going to be a huge role as a carbon sink as you  
**[0:03:44-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:44):**  try and get greenhouse gas emissions out of the atmosphere, whether that's in soil, in  
**[0:03:51-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:51):**  trees or biomass on the land.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:53):**  But terrestrial carbon, we think it's got a huge future of the next 50 to 100 years.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:58):**  But looking more broadly, looking at water quality, the water we drink coming out of  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:04:03):**  our taps is hugely influenced by what flows into it from agricultural and forest landscapes  
**[0:04:08-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:04:08):**  upstream and issues like nitrate pollution, pesticides, runoff, sedimentation, all play  
**[0:04:17-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:04:17):**  a big role in that.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:04:18):**  Biodiversity, of course, is another huge issue.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:04:22):**  Agriculture and deforestation are responsible for some of the biggest biodiversity losses.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:04:27):**  We have all these overlapping environmental pressures which are just intensifying as time  
**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:04:34):**  goes by.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:04:37):**  We decided to get into it from an investment point of view because although there are these  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:04:42):**  threats, you also see some huge opportunities where we found that there are more ecological  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:04:47):**  farming systems out there which are able to address those environmental issues, able to  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:04:52):**  put carbon in the soil, able to improve water quality, increase biodiversity, improve soil  
**[0:04:57-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:04:57):**  health while also generating really good yields at a low cost in a very profitable way.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:06):**  We think those systems are proven at a small scale and there are some fantastic case studies  
**[0:05:11-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:11):**  out there.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:12):**  Often driven just by innovative farmers, not necessarily coming out of academia or research  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:16):**  institutes but by really innovative farmers trying out new ideas and creating things from  
**[0:05:21-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:21):**  the ground up.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:22):**  They're proven at a small scale but they need to be scaled up.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:25):**  That's where we think investment capital can play a role.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:28):**  We help turbocharge a transition from let's say more extractive, conventional, industrial,  
**[0:05:34-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:34):**  agricultural systems to more ecological, sustainable, resilient agricultural systems.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:41):**  When you look at the current situation, because often investors are asking the question why  
**[0:05:46-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:46):**  now and what has changed in a sector to make it extremely interesting to enter at the moment,  
**[0:05:53-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:53):**  what makes the sector at the moment, except for all the huge issues you mentioned before,  
**[0:05:59-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:59):**  so interesting to start?  
**[0:06:00-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:00):**  Is it that the pioneers are ready?  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:02):**  Is it that the systems are tried and now is the moment to scale them up or is there something  
**[0:06:07-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:07):**  else as well?  
**[0:06:08-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:08):**  Yeah, I think there's two things changing at the moment.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:10):**  I think the first, going back to those environmental issues I talked about, what we're seeing is  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:14):**  that those, let's say what were previously externalities which people got away with for  
**[0:06:19-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:19):**  free are increasingly being price regulated.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:24):**  Actually farmers, land managers have been forced by policy regulation to actually take  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:30):**  into account the impacts they're having on carbon, on water, on soils and biodiversity.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:35):**  That's leading to restrictive regulations in some places where you just can't do what  
**[0:06:40-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:40):**  you could do before.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:43):**  Take antibiotic use in intensive livestock production.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:46):**  That was absolutely widespread prophylactic use of low-dose antibiotics, completely mainstream  
**[0:06:53-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:53):**  in a lot of feedlot in the US for example.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:56):**  That's going to change because everyone has seen antibiotic resistant diseases, massive  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:01):**  human health implications and the regulations are tightening and that practice will have  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:06):**  to change and people will have to take antibiotics out of use.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:10):**  We're seeing those regulations tightening up.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:12):**  On the flip side, the environmental side, we're also seeing some positive signals coming along,  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:17):**  some potential rewards for doing things the right way.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:21):**  For example, carbon markets, more talk than action so far when it comes to land in particular.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:28):**  We are seeing the emergence of these markets.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:29):**  For example, in Australia where we work, the government's emissions reduction fund is putting  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:34):**  2.5 billion Australian dollars to work, paying mostly farmers to store carbon in trees, low  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:40):**  soil on rural landscapes.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:44):**  That's starting to generate some really interesting economic consensus to change practices.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:47):**  I think that's the first part around those environmental externalities are getting priced,  
**[0:07:51-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:51):**  getting regulated.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:52):**  The farmers have to take into account more now than in the past.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:55):**  I think a second and maybe even a more powerful driver, a more immediate driver is shifting  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:08:01):**  consumer demands and consumer trends.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:08:05):**  The modern consumer, particularly young millennial consumer, is very aware of all these environmental  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:08:10):**  issues, very concerned about where their food comes from.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:08:15):**  They're motivated by issues of sustainability but also of health, nutrition, flavor.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:08:22):**  That's creating massive demand in markets like organic foods, grass-fed beef, grass-fed  
**[0:08:27-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:08:27):**  dairy products.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:08:28):**  They're the fastest growing sectors in food at the moment.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:08:32):**  A lot of the traditional food companies have seen that and are scrambling to respond.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:08:38):**  Consumers are driving very, very quickly.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:08:39):**  Then on the other side, you have environmental regulation and markets kicking in as well.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:08:44):**  We think the shift is just beginning and a long way to go.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:08:49):**  When you look at what drove you personally into the sector, was there a specific moment  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:08:56):**  or was it something that grew over time, how you ended up on the regenerative or ecological  
**[0:09:02-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:09:02):**  farming side?  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:09:04):**  I first came to this while working at a company called Climate Change Capital in London.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:09:08):**  It was an investment manager which had at that time the world's largest carbon fund.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:09:15):**  We were given the task of looking at land through a climate change lens.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:09:20):**  When you do that, you actually come to quite some conclusions because you're looking at  
**[0:09:23-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:09:23):**  it in terms of A, mitigation, so how you put carbon back into the landscape, but B, adaptation  
**[0:09:30-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:09:30):**  and resilience.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:09:31):**  How do you make land more resilient to a changing climate where there's going to be more extremes  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:09:34):**  of drought and flooding and heat waves and storms?  
**[0:09:39-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:09:39):**  If you look at it through that lens, you realize that what we need to do is build healthier  
**[0:09:45-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:09:45):**  soil, put soil organic matter back in the soil, have more resilient ecosystems and landscapes,  
**[0:09:51-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:09:51):**  more diverse landscapes as well.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:09:53):**  You end up gravitating towards these more ecological farming systems.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:09:58):**  It was a process of discovery which I began probably about eight, nine years ago now where  
**[0:10:04-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:10:04):**  we developed these initial ideas.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:10:06):**  I think the good thing is the more we've worked in this sector, we've worked in this now since  
**[0:10:10-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:10:10):**  2008, the more we find that those ideas have been validated.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:10:14):**  There's more and more case studies of farmers proving these systems can work economically  
**[0:10:20-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:10:20):**  and environmentally all around the world.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:10:23):**  Those consumer trends are intensifying as are those efforts to regulate the environmental  
**[0:10:30-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:10:30):**  impacts as well.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:10:31):**  It began eight years ago, but the nice thing is that we just think it's a train that's  
**[0:10:36-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:10:36):**  sort of gathering momentum year by year.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:10:39):**  Yeah, I completely agree obviously.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:10:44):**  To come back to one of your points, you mentioned resilience in the farmland.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:10:48):**  I can imagine from an investor point of view, and you mentioned that in the white paper  
**[0:10:52-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:10:52):**  as well, it's very interesting to be invested in farms or farmland or farmland operations  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:11:01):**  that are more resilient, especially in a time where climate change starts to kick in.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:11:05):**  Can you explain a bit more about how that changes a business model of a farm and how  
**[0:11:09-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:11:09):**  that's different from the traditional slash chemical way of farming?  
**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:11:16):**  Farming is the ultimate biological business.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:11:21):**  The fundamental business of farming is taking sunlight, energy, combining with water and  
**[0:11:29-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:11:29):**  the properties and minerals of the soils to grow things.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:11:32):**  It's a biological system.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:11:34):**  You're always going to be exposed to fluctuations in weather and climate.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:11:39):**  That's always been the case or it will be the case.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:11:42):**  We do see that those extremes are getting more dangerous as time goes by.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:11:49):**  The more conventional systems can be very stressed by that.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:11:51):**  There's quite a few examples of that, for example, organic coffee systems, which are  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:11:57):**  able to out-produce in terms of yield, conventional coffee systems during droughts.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:12:01):**  There's been a number of case studies in 2012 in the US where that was the case with corn  
**[0:12:05-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:12:05):**  production.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:12:08):**  We've also seen it when it comes to pasture-based systems, grass-based systems, where the landscapes  
**[0:12:14-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:12:14):**  that have healthier soils, healthier grasses, using forms of rotational grazing or multi-pave  
**[0:12:21-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:12:21):**  grazing are able to ride out those droughts and floods an awful lot better.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:12:29):**  It's an interesting scene because economically from a financial point of view, you can take  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:12:34):**  out some of those fluctuations in yield and production when those weather extremes hit,  
**[0:12:39-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:12:39):**  but also take off some of the reliance on input costs as well.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:12:43):**  You can just smooth out the returns and the profitability and income from the land.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:12:49):**  I remember one example, I think, where in the drought, one ecological farm was still  
**[0:12:57-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:12:57):**  producing about 80% of their normal yield, but their neighbors were probably hardly harvesting  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:13:04):**  anything, which would for them, of course, mean a completely lost year.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:13:08):**  But for the ecological farm, they were still having, although 20% less than normal, but  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:13:14):**  actually a proper yield to sell, probably at far higher prices because of the drought.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:13:19):**  Exactly, yeah.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:13:20):**  There's quite a few examples.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:13:21):**  There was also a great example, I think, from Central America when after one of the big  
**[0:13:25-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:13:25):**  hurricanes hit, they examined a whole range of farms on the hillsides and found that those  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:13:32):**  using more ecological practices, better soil health, they're the ones that survived.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:13:38):**  There's the ones that were more chemical based, more conventional, huge problems with erosion,  
**[0:13:42-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:13:42):**  a lot of crops that people wiped out.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:13:44):**  I think there's growing body evidence around that theme.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:13:48):**  There's also diversity.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:13:49):**  I think you find that those more ecological farms tend to be growing a broader mix of  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:13:53):**  crops or raising a broader mix of animals.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:13:57):**  You're getting some resilience just from diversity, which really reflects and mimics nature.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:14:02):**  Nature likes diversity.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:14:03):**  Nature abhors a monoculture.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:14:04):**  That gives you resilience environmentally, but also in terms of markets as well, where  
**[0:14:10-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:14:10):**  you're going to have good years and bad years for different products.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:14:14):**  Nature gets bored when there's a monoculture and starts annoying it with pests, etc.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:14:20):**  Fights back rather effectively.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:14:22):**  In the long run, you don't win that.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:14:26):**  If you look, we'll make it a bit more concrete.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:14:30):**  You co-founded SLM Partners to dive into this trend and to see the opportunities.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:14:36):**  When was that?  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:14:37):**  We founded SLM Partners in 2009.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:14:42):**  Our vision is building an asset management firm that focuses on sustainable regenerative  
**[0:14:49-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:14:49):**  agriculture and forestry.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:14:50):**  We take a real assets approach.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:14:52):**  We're in most cases looking to acquire land or invest in land as the primary asset.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:14:58):**  We look to really accelerate the shift in management from, let's say, more conventional  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:15:05):**  and sustainable practices to more sustainable regenerative practices.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:15:09):**  What we've done so far, we've raised an Australian beef cattle fund in 2012.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:15:16):**  We have about 100 million Australian dollars in equity and debt in that structure in Australia.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:15:21):**  We've acquired over a million acres of land in Australia for grass-fed beef cattle production  
**[0:15:26-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:15:26):**  using a form of rotational grazing called adaptive multi-paddock grazing or holistic  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:15:32):**  grazing to take somewhat degraded land and to regenerate it and bring back the health  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:15:38):**  of the soil from the grasses just by managing cattle in a slightly different way.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:15:43):**  We're also working some new ideas.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:15:45):**  We're raising an Irish forestry fund at the moment.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:15:48):**  We've got backing from the European Investment Bank for that.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:15:51):**  The idea there is we're looking to acquire existing mid-rotation commercial forest in  
**[0:15:56-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:15:56):**  Ireland, all of which are destined to clear fell, which can be destructive in terms of  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:16:01):**  impacts on soils and water and biodiversity and even carbon storage.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:16:06):**  We want to transform where possible to a more sustainable type of forest management called  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:16:11):**  continuous cover forestry where you never clear the forest, you maintain forest cover,  
**[0:16:16-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:16:16):**  you selectively harvest, you get a more natural diverse forest.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:16:19):**  We're also working on some investment strategies in Chile and Patagonia, looking at sheep  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:16:24):**  production and looking at a couple of ideas in North America as well.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:16:28):**  Global focus, but everything comes back to a more ecological, let's say, farming or forestry  
**[0:16:35-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:16:35):**  system which is proven at a smaller scale and looking to scale it up through ownership  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:16:41):**  of controlled land and then also partnering with really great farmers and foresters.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:16:46):**  I mean, that's the other key thing.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:16:49):**  There's lots of people running around, former bankers with presentations and spreadsheets  
**[0:16:54-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:16:54):**  and that's kind of easy to do, but the hard part is actually making it happen on the ground  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:16:58):**  and for that you need great technical people, great operational managers, people who've  
**[0:17:03-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:17:03):**  got dirt on their fingernails and really have done this before.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:17:05):**  So we always try and partner with those people locally wherever we're operating.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:17:10):**  When you look at the last few months and what kept you up at night, what have you been working  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:17:18):**  on and of course what you are allowed and possible to share, but what kept you up and  
**[0:17:23-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:17:23):**  what are you proud of that worked in the last few months?  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:17:30):**  I think in terms of progress we've made the last few months, I think we've done some quite  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:17:35):**  interesting carbon deals in Australia.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:17:37):**  We're quite proud of it, we're participating in the Australian Emissions Reduction Fund.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:17:42):**  I mentioned it before where we've actually won contracts to supply quite a large amount  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:17:47):**  of carbon credits from the land that we own in Australia, mostly through regeneration  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:17:52):**  of native woodlands and a savannah type woodland ecosystem, which is very consistent with the  
**[0:17:56-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:17:56):**  kind of grazing approach that we're using down there.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:17:59):**  So that's been exciting to see that market develop and to be able to participate in that.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:18:05):**  I think the other thing that's quite exciting, we're on the verge of launching our Irish  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:18:09):**  Forestry Fund, which will be a bit of a new departure for us in September, but I'm originally  
**[0:18:14-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:18:14):**  from Ireland so it's close to my heart.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:18:17):**  I think we have the chance to really catalyse a change in how forests are managed, not just  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:18:23):**  in Ireland but potentially across north-west Europe where there's a kind of reliance in  
**[0:18:27-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:18:27):**  clear felling and we think there might be a slightly better way to do it.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:18:30):**  So that's been two of the more exciting things to be involved with over the last few years.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:18:36):**  An ongoing challenge, a lot of work we have put into is raising capital and educating  
**[0:18:42-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:18:42):**  investors and finding investors who are willing to back the kind of strategies that we're  
**[0:18:49-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:18:49):**  developing.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:18:50):**  I think it's an overall lack of understanding of agriculture actually, just full stop.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:18:54):**  It's quite new as an asset class for many investors.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:18:59):**  And it has not tended to attract much institutional capital actually until quite recently.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:19:03):**  So a huge amount of education has to be done just to get people comfortable with the dynamic  
**[0:19:08-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:19:08):**  of the sector.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:19:10):**  And then beyond that, a few things a little bit more ecological, something which is maybe  
**[0:19:16-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:19:16):**  not quite the mainstream.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:19:17):**  There's an extra level then of education to show people evidence, get people comfortable  
**[0:19:21-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:19:21):**  that this can be scaled up.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:19:23):**  Yeah, I think that's an excellent point you make because I think in the white paper you  
**[0:19:27-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:19:27):**  mentioned since 2009 that the boom in agriculture investment really started.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:19:33):**  But of course it was all traditional agriculture and the time of easy money or the days of  
**[0:19:39-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:19:39):**  easy money are over.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:19:40):**  So it's almost educating investors in how agriculture actually should be done, but they  
**[0:19:48-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:19:48):**  either don't know it or they're used to something else or to get different presentations with  
**[0:19:52-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:19:52):**  slightly different time horizons, et cetera.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:19:55):**  So how do you find, because what's the big difference in the presentations you're giving  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:20:00):**  and other fund managers in the agriculture space are giving?  
**[0:20:05-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:20:05):**  And what's the response to that?  
**[0:20:06-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:20:06):**  Sure.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:20:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:20:08):**  Well, I think there's a small number of groups like ours who are trying to attract investment  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:20:14):**  in these more ecological regenerative agriculture systems.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:20:18):**  In our white paper we identify I think six or seven different groups, probably in total  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:20:21):**  we managed about $500 million in assets.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:20:26):**  So it's not insignificant.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:20:27):**  At the same time, if you look at the total money raised for agriculture investment over  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:20:31):**  the last 10 years, it's probably more than 20 billion.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:20:36):**  So it's still a small percent of that.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:20:39):**  I think most of the money has been flowing into conventional and more industrial farming  
**[0:20:43-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:20:43):**  systems.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:20:44):**  It kind of appeals in a way to a financial mindset where everything gets reduced to a  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:20:47):**  really linear process where you acquire an asset, you work out what it costs in terms  
**[0:20:53-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:20:53):**  of inputs to put things in and what you might get to take things out the other end.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:20:58):**  And the more simplified it can seem and the more industrial it can seem, the more it can  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:21:01):**  look like a factory, for example, the easier it is in some ways to convince people that  
**[0:21:06-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:21:06):**  this is the way to go.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:21:08):**  So I think there's a small number of us who are trying to show that there's quite a ferocious  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:21:12):**  debate going on within farming around the future of agriculture and that there are some  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:21:16):**  really interesting and compelling strategies that have a more ecological leaning.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:21:21):**  I think though that that space is opening up more and more now actually and that will  
**[0:21:25-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:21:25):**  be the third factor.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:21:26):**  I mentioned about the environmental regulation and consumer trends, but actually the third  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:21:31):**  thing that's happening on the investment side is if you look at where money flowed in agriculture  
**[0:21:35-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:21:35):**  over the last five to 10 years, it mostly went into quite passive buying and lease strategies.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:21:40):**  So if you focus on North America, where people land banking, acquiring land, leasing it out,  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:21:47):**  not really caring too much what happened on the land and just riding up a secular upswing  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:21:51):**  in land prices.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:21:52):**  And there was some pretty aggressive land depreciation, especially in the US, in many  
**[0:21:56-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:21:56):**  parts of the world over the last decade, and that produced good returns.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:21:59):**  But that started to run out of steam now because land prices are actually coming down, they're  
**[0:22:04-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:22:04):**  correcting cash rates are coming down, if you look at conventional corn, soybean wheat  
**[0:22:11-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:22:11):**  prices, they're low, farmers are actually losing money, most of them this year in the  
**[0:22:17-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:22:17):**  US.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:22:18):**  So it's a pretty tough time actually in conventional agriculture to make any money.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:22:23):**  And at the same time, you look at what's happening in organic space in these more, let's say,  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:22:28):**  consumer friendly markets, that's where all the growth is, that's where premiums are available,  
**[0:22:32-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:22:32):**  that's where people are still making good money.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:22:34):**  I think investors are waking up to that, they're seeing it as more passive conventional strategies  
**[0:22:38-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:22:38):**  are maybe running out of puff a little bit and they're looking for, say, a higher value  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:22:44):**  add, more active, more niche strategies where they can get behind the team and propel some  
**[0:22:48-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:22:48):**  changes in how the land is managed and capture more returns from that.  
**[0:22:54-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:22:54):**  Yeah, it seems like the perfect storm for the traditional agriculture system has arrived.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:23:01):**  If you look at what do you see as the biggest risk or the biggest hidden overlooked risk  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:23:07):**  of the traditional agriculture side?  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:23:10):**  You mentioned a number of them in the white paper, what for you is the number one overlooked  
**[0:23:15-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:23:15):**  risk there?  
**[0:23:17-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:23:17):**  Well, I think it depends on your timeframe.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:23:21):**  I think if you look over a very long timeframe, I think the degradation of natural assets,  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:23:28):**  in particular soil degradation, I think it's a huge issue for humankind of the next century.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:23:33):**  It's one of these slow run problems that you can ignore, especially if you're in a very  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:23:39):**  fertile area with very deep topsoil, but eventually it will come back to bite you.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:23:45):**  For example, Iowa is a great example, one of the most fertile, wonderful soils in the  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:23:49):**  world, but Iowa's lost half of its topsoil over the last 150 years through erosion.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:23:54):**  Now, it's still got many feet left because it's incredibly deep, but that just keeps  
**[0:23:59-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:23:59):**  going on.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:24:00):**  Eventually, you will hit bedrock and you will see declining yields and problems cropping  
**[0:24:05-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:24:05):**  up.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:24:06):**  I think that soil degradation is one of these things that doesn't get a huge amount of attention,  
**[0:24:09-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:24:09):**  but it's a big issue.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:24:12):**  If you go to more, let's say, more brittle parts of the world, which didn't start out  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:24:17):**  with such abundant resources, natural resources, and soil resources, you are seeing it really  
**[0:24:22-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:24:22):**  kicking in where erosion, loss of nutrients, loss of soil structure is leading to collapse  
**[0:24:29-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:24:29):**  of systems.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:24:31):**  Climate change is aggravating that to a large extent.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:24:35):**  I think that's the long-term thing.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:24:36):**  I think in the immediate term, the bigger risk of the more conventional systems is the  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:24:42):**  changing consumer.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:24:43):**  The consumer, whether you agree or disagree, wants something different from what conventional  
**[0:24:49-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:24:49):**  ag is selling.  
**[0:24:50-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:24:50):**  The consumer wants something green and healthy, flavorsome with a story behind it, and that's  
**[0:25:01-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:25:01):**  good for the environment.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:25:02):**  I think that the more conventional system has a real struggle on the hands trying to  
**[0:25:07-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:25:07):**  overcome that.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:25:08):**  I think that's what's going to propel immediate shifts back on the supply chain via the food  
**[0:25:13-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:25:13):**  company, via the restaurants, via the chipotle's and Whole Foods of the world who are recognizing  
**[0:25:20-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:25:20):**  that and trying to follow it.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:25:23):**  When you look at the sector, the regenerative agriculture sector as it's scaling, what are  
**[0:25:28-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:25:28):**  the two most important barriers you see for the sector to reach its potential?  
**[0:25:34-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:25:34):**  I think the question we always get, and I think lots of people get working in this space,  
**[0:25:39-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:25:39):**  is where is the track record?  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:25:42):**  Where is the proof?  
**[0:25:43-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:25:43):**  A lot of these systems have been proven, sometimes at a small and medium scale, usually by individual  
**[0:25:50-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:25:50):**  farmers, but there can be a bit of a leap to go from that to actually an investment  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:25:54):**  product, a fund or a company doing it at a larger scale.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:25:59):**  I think that's probably the biggest challenge still, just being able to show evidence and  
**[0:26:04-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:26:04):**  data that this can be done at a scale.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:26:08):**  I think there's enough proof that...  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:26:09):**  Nature has done it for a few billion years, but...  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:26:13):**  I think there's enough proof at that medium scale, economic proof as well, of really great  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:26:19):**  medium to large scale producers doing it on their own funds.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:26:23):**  I think that is there, and then I think it is possible to go from there to a slightly  
**[0:26:27-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:26:27):**  larger version of that, a more institutional investment version of that.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:26:30):**  I think as time goes by, we will fill in more of the gaps and we'll have more successful  
**[0:26:36-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:26:36):**  funds out there with track records, and then it becomes much, much easier.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:26:39):**  I think that's probably still the biggest obstacle is that question of track record  
**[0:26:42-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:26:42):**  and the proof.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:26:45):**  I think the second is just a more general one for the sector, and that just agriculture  
**[0:26:53-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:26:53):**  of any type is still unfamiliar territory for most investors.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:26:57):**  You don't have education required to get people used to the dynamics of the sector.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:27:03):**  It tends to be capital intensive.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:27:05):**  The returns are lower.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:27:07):**  You're not going to get your VC, private equity, 20%, 25% net IRRs.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:27:13):**  It's just not possible.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:27:15):**  By the same thing, you've got a lot of downside protection because you have real assets, you  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:27:18):**  have land, you have biological assets, which are also appreciating assets usually over  
**[0:27:23-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:27:23):**  time rather than depreciating.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:27:25):**  I think just getting people to understand the dynamics of the sector is the other obstacle.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:27:30):**  Some have got there and are allocating and investing heavily, but a lot are still working  
**[0:27:34-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:27:34):**  their way through the education process.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:27:37):**  They're still in the return vision of Silicon Valley.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:27:41):**  The illusion of the 20%, 25% that it's possible outside software.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:27:46):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:27:48):**  When you look at the barrier of scaling the few pioneers or the pioneers with a few hundred  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:27:55):**  or a few thousand hectares to a fund like S&M, like you're managing now, how did you  
**[0:28:01-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:28:01):**  overcome that barrier to investors?  
**[0:28:04-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:28:04):**  Because I know the fundraising hasn't been easy.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:28:07):**  Is there any key lesson, any key takeaway on how to overcome that and be one of the  
**[0:28:12-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:28:12):**  first to raise such a fund?  
**[0:28:14-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:28:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:28:15):**  Well, I think the first thing is building a great team.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:28:17):**  So actually building a team with real farmers who've actually done it before and who can  
**[0:28:25-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:28:25):**  point in a way to their own personal track record.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:28:27):**  There may not be a traditional financial track record of IRRs and multiples and the like,  
**[0:28:35-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:28:35):**  but it's an operational track record.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:28:38):**  I think having those people on the team is critical.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:28:40):**  I think the second then is being able then to identify and research and the capital out  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:28:47):**  in a way, the case studies that do exist in that particular region and be able to present  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:28:52):**  them to investors and take investors to those farms and show them, that's what we did.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:28:56):**  We took investors to farms in Australia using the same ideas, having done it with great  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:29:01):**  success and so they could see it in their own eyes, yeah, this has been done on let's  
**[0:29:05-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:29:05):**  say 10,000, 20,000 acres.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:29:08):**  Well, there's no reason it can't be done on 100,000 or 500,000 acres.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:29:12):**  So I think having those real life case studies is very important.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:29:18):**  And if you look at your coming months, let's say six months, what are you working on mainly  
**[0:29:25-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:29:25):**  and what are your main goals for the next half a year?  
**[0:29:31-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:29:31):**  So we'll be continuing operations in Australia and looking to take advantage of the really  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:29:41):**  good year in terms of rainfall and growth down there.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:29:45):**  So very much focused on operations in Australia and then raising capital for our new projects  
**[0:29:49-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:29:49):**  in Ireland and forestry and also in Chile and livestock.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:29:52):**  And then we're starting to think about some ideas in North America as well where I think  
**[0:29:58-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:29:58):**  it is possible to do things at even probably an even greater scale given the dynamics that  
**[0:30:03-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:30:03):**  are there.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:30:04):**  So we're putting a lot of effort quietly into developing some strategies for the US.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:30:10):**  And for Ireland, do you see, because you've been for six, seven years talking about livestock  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:30:17):**  to investors and to your network and now you're talking about trees and forests, is that difficult  
**[0:30:22-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:30:22):**  for them to get their heads around or are you already into the door because you've built  
**[0:30:29-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:30:29):**  up this track record in agriculture in general?  
**[0:30:33-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:30:33):**  So a couple of things.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:30:34):**  I think we always said at the beginning that we want to look at agriculture and forestry.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:30:38):**  If you look at our philosophy is around rural land and harnessing sunlight, water and soils  
**[0:30:48-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:30:48):**  to grow things.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:30:49):**  And it seems to me that financial investors like to think in asset classes but nature  
**[0:30:56-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:30:56):**  doesn't think that way.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:30:58):**  The boundaries are fluid and everything is interlinked.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:31:01):**  So we actually can see a time in the future where we may even try and combine some agriculture  
**[0:31:06-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:31:06):**  and forestry strategies together.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:31:07):**  So they've always been kept apart but we see some really interesting potential agroforestry  
**[0:31:12-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:31:12):**  systems in some parts of the world.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:31:14):**  So I think our new step into forestry is always something we had in mind and I think in the  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:31:21):**  future we could see some very complimentary things in the agriculture side and the forestry  
**[0:31:25-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:31:25):**  side.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:31:26):**  I think the second thing is we've also been building up a team of people who have this  
**[0:31:29-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:31:29):**  real forestry experience.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:31:30):**  So we have a guy who's joined our team in London who spent his whole life in forestry  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:31:37):**  who helped run a $250 million forestry fund in Asia and we're working with a great team  
**[0:31:43-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:31:43):**  of forest planners in Ireland too.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:31:45):**  So again without that team there'd be no point in even trying because we have the right people  
**[0:31:49-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:31:49):**  in place and it is credible.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:31:53):**  And for the teams on the ground is it difficult or challenging maybe to see a future where  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:31:59):**  those two worlds collide or it's very natural to imagine livestock and forestry in the  
**[0:32:04-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:32:04):**  same system at some point?  
**[0:32:07-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:32:07):**  It depends where you go.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:32:08):**  I think it's interesting I think in educational terms where people go to college and learn  
**[0:32:15-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:32:15):**  about agroforestry, they're often quite separate and actually one of the unfortunate implications  
**[0:32:21-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:32:21):**  of policy has also been to keep the two very apart as well.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:32:25):**  Especially in Europe where you have a common agriculture policy which is all about farming  
**[0:32:29-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:32:29):**  and you have forest policies which are all about forestry and never the twain shall meet  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:32:34):**  and God forbid you fall in between because then you might lose out on your subsidies  
**[0:32:38-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:32:38):**  on both sides and that wouldn't be good.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:32:40):**  So I think there's also some unintended consequences from the policy side where keeping those worlds  
**[0:32:45-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:32:45):**  apart.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:32:46):**  Having said that, there are some again fantastic innovators out there doing agroforestry and  
**[0:32:52-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:32:52):**  silvopalatial systems very successfully at a decent scale.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:32:58):**  Examples in the US, examples in Spain, examples in other parts of the world.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:33:01):**  So we think that's a really exciting area actually, agroforestry and that there is enough  
**[0:33:10-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:33:10):**  of those conditions in place in terms of case studies, technical experts that will be possibly  
**[0:33:15-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:33:15):**  there in the future.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:33:17):**  Extremely interesting.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:33:18):**  So I would like to conclude with the last question.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:33:21):**  If you could give advice to smart investors that want to get into the regenerative agriculture  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:33:27):**  space, what would be your number one advice?  
**[0:33:32-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:33:32):**  I think only invest with teams who have real farmers on board.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:33:40):**  It's too easy to come up and sell a concept but farming is actually really hard and it's  
**[0:33:48-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:33:48):**  actually hard managing a fund for example.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:33:50):**  So unless you've got people on a team who've actually done this and have made mistakes  
**[0:33:54-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:33:54):**  and have the scars to show it, then I'd be a little bit wary.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:33:58):**  So I think having that technical operational element is so important in the world of agriculture.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:34:05):**  Are there moments in the last six, seven years that you, because you don't have farming experience,  
**[0:34:11-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:34:11):**  right?  
**[0:34:12-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:34:12):**  No, but thankfully I partner with people who do.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:34:15):**  Have you had any experiences where the lack of farming experience of you was awkward or  
**[0:34:21-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:34:21):**  painful or?  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:34:24):**  Really, because I know when to defer to the experts on our teams.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:34:29):**  So I think it's important that people bring a diverse range of skills to a team.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:34:37):**  Those with the technical knowledge are given the space to make those decisions and drive  
**[0:34:42-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:34:42):**  strategy when appropriate.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:34:43):**  At the same time, it is also important to have people with investment financial experience  
**[0:34:47-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:34:47):**  as well who know what investors want, who can structure things, who can report back,  
**[0:34:54-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:34:54):**  who can make it work as an investment.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:34:57):**  So there's a certain amount of translation has to go on between the world of farming  
**[0:35:00-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:35:00):**  and the world of finance, which speaks very different languages.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:35:04):**  That's actually exactly the type of people I would like to interview in this podcast  
**[0:35:11-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:35:11):**  who are with one leg in the farming world and with the other leg in the finance world  
**[0:35:15-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:35:15):**  to scale the regenerative agriculture space.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:35:18):**  So thank you, Paul, so much for your time and your knowledge today.

**[0:37:43-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:37:43):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:37:46):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through

**[0:37:55-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:37:55):**  Is this course free?  
**[0:37:56-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:37:56):**  No.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:37:57):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:38:00):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:38:04):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:38:08-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:38:08):**  different means.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:38:09):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you, and if you have the means to  
**[0:38:15-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:38:15):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:38:17):**  Thank you.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:38:18):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:38:20-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:38:20):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:38:26-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:38:26):**  so you don't have to write along.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:38:28):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:38:33-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:38:33):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:38:38-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:38:38):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:38:43-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:38:43):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:38:45):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:38:50-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:38:50):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:38:53):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  
**[0:38:58-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:38:58):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:38:59-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:38:59):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:39:01):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:39:04):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:39:07):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:39:09):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:39:14):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea, or whatever you're drinking.

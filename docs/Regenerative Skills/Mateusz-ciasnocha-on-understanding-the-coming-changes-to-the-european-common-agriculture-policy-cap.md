**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:04:25):**  Great question and thank you for having me, Olivia, and it's great also to be on climate  
**[0:04:29-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:04:29):**  farmers team supporting farmers in their transition of farming in harmony with nature.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:04:40):**  I just said the mission of climate farmers and this is how I also see my work at a policy  
**[0:04:45-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:04:45):**  political engagement regulatory level.

**[0:04:54-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:04:54):**  industrial advocacy lead.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:04:57):**  That builds on me being a farmer, also me being actively involved in global political  
**[0:05:03-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:05:03):**  and regulatory processes that are concerned with agriculture, mainly the climate process  
**[0:05:11-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:05:11):**  and a bunch of things I've done in that space, mainly as a farmer, but also as somebody who  
**[0:05:17-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:05:17):**  is lobbying for the farmers.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:05:20):**  And from that perspective, I see my work being very consistent with the core of climate farmers  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:05:27):**  activity, which is just like we are building infrastructure to scale regenerative agriculture  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:05:32):**  in numerous fields.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:05:34):**  There's an infrastructure component to regulatory environment in which farmers are operating,

**[0:05:45-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:05:45):**  And what I mean by that completely is we have the CAP, which I guess will be a very big  
**[0:05:51-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:05:51):**  part of our conversation today.

**[0:06:26-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:06:26):**  the direction of action.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:06:28):**  We want to get to net zero by 2050 at the very latest.

**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:06:38):**  And as we all know, with climate farmers and farmers that we work with and partners also

**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:06:57):**  and others that can be harnessed in that transition.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:07:02):**  So it's not only about a hardcore numerical goal, it's very much about that.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:07:07):**  But the pathway is equally, if not more important than the goal itself.

**[0:07:26-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:07:26):**  reality, right?

**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:07:30):**  It is very much about that, but it's about so much more and other people, Ivo, you, Oliver,  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:07:36):**  your guests have done a tremendous job of explaining what that is.

**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:08:24):**  In fact, right now you are on a tour through the United States, which we were just talking

**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:08:44):**  So I am one of the participants of what is called YTLE Fellowship of the Department of  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:08:49):**  State of the United States of America.

**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:08:59):**  I'm sorry about the full name.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:09:03):**  I can look it up if you want to play.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:09:05):**  No, no, it's okay.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:09:06):**  I recognize it's really early where you are.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:09:08):**  I wouldn't remember.

**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:09:11):**  Let me start the answer once again and then you can simply cut it out.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:09:15):**  Yeah, yeah, go ahead.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:09:17):**  Yeah, so I'm more than happy to tell you more about what I'm doing here in the US.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:09:21):**  I am at YTLE, which stands for the Young Transatlantic Innovation Leaders Initiate Fellowship Program  
**[0:09:28-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:09:28):**  of the Department of State of the United States of America, which takes me together with 50

**[0:09:44-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:09:44):**  I know you are American, but the Americans are doing business and how this business culture  
**[0:09:49-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:09:49):**  works.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:09:50):**  And I am placed at an organization called Resource Conservation District of Greater  
**[0:09:54-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:09:54):**  San Diego County in California, the very south of California, where I am basically sharing  
**[0:10:03-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:10:03):**  as well as learning knowledge or learning from my colleagues through meeting the farmers  
**[0:10:10-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:10:10):**  that they are working with, going to different conferences.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:10:14):**  And my trip here is very timely because like one of the annual conferences on climate action  
**[0:10:21-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:10:21):**  and climate smart agriculture has just happened earlier this week.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:10:25):**  I've been there, really good conversations.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:10:27):**  It's really interesting to see how similar policy conversations are.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:10:36):**  And I made that comment discussing the earlier question, right?  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:10:40):**  Like in Europe, CAP stands for Common Agriculture Policy.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:10:44):**  In California, it stands for Climate Action Plan, right?  
**[0:10:50-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:10:50):**  And like the challenge in Europe is how do you include more measurable climate actions  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:10:59):**  in the Common Agriculture Policy?  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:11:02):**  Here in California, the issue is more how do you include agriculture in what is a very  
**[0:11:08-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:11:08):**  ambitious climate action plan?  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:11:10):**  So different realities, but very, very similar.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:11:15):**  And needless to say, it's my pleasure to be here in the US learning all there is to be  
**[0:11:21-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:11:21):**  learned here, contribute somehow to those processes here in the US, as well as of course  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:11:29):**  bring that knowledge back to Europe and through that be more efficient with our climate farmers  
**[0:11:35-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:11:35):**  policy work and also have that impacting our other activities business-wise and advocacy-wise.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:11:44):**  So let's take a step back because you've already defined what the Common Agricultural Policy  
**[0:11:48-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:11:48):**  is, but it hasn't always existed.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:11:51):**  In fact, Europe has only really been around as a federation in that way since the beginning  
**[0:11:56-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:11:56):**  of the century.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:11:58):**  Can you tell me a bit about the history of the Common Agriculture Policy and how it has  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:12:02):**  affected agriculture across the continent since its formation?  
**[0:12:07-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:12:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:12:08):**  So Europe is not the federation, it's a union.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:12:12):**  Sorry, union.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:12:13):**  Which is super important to know, we are not the federation.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:12:18):**  And yeah, so to answer this question quickly, but hopefully providing key pieces of information.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:12:25):**  As it is right now, the CAP Common Agriculture Policy is the key policy of the European Union  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:12:32):**  budget-wise, meaning within the budget of the European Union, biggest component of the  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:12:37):**  budget money-wise is spent on the Common Agriculture Policy.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:12:42):**  That percentage is declining, but still it is the largest spending item within the budget  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:12:50):**  of the European Union as we speak right now.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:12:54):**  That isn't to say that other policies of the EU, like the climate policy or energy policy  
**[0:13:00-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:13:00):**  of the EU, are not equally important because they are.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:13:06):**  Only the mechanisms for implementing are different and the money might not be coming through  
**[0:13:10-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:13:10):**  taxation but they might be just designing a regulation so that the sector is playing  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:13:19):**  within the rules designed by the EU, like with emission trading scheme, EU, ETS, that  
**[0:13:25-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:13:25):**  agriculture might be part of at a certain time in the future or might not.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:13:31):**  And the question is, what do the farmers want?  
**[0:13:34-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:13:34):**  Do we want to be part of that?  
**[0:13:36-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:13:36):**  No.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:13:37):**  We have to think, yes, what is the pathway in either way that we as farmers, that climate  
**[0:13:42-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:13:42):**  farmers are supporting, want in that future?  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:13:48):**  And those are big questions that are some of the questions we are answering right now  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:13:53):**  with the design of the new CAP.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:13:57):**  But talking about the past of the CAP, it has a long story.

**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:14:07):**  So you are either doing something and you are eligible for a payment or you are not

**[0:15:16-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:15:16):**  Usually it operates in seven years periods because EU budget is a seven year budget.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:15:23):**  So the last budget that we have had as the EU is 2013-2020.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:15:32):**  Because of COVID, when it comes to the Common Agriculture Policy, not in a new budget of

**[0:15:59-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:15:59):**  And we will have the new Common Agriculture Policy starting in January next year for the

**[0:16:17-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:16:17):**  So I will not speak to that right now.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:16:20):**  So let me see if I understand this well.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:16:22):**  So within the Union, there has been a budget that was passed for a seven year period that  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:16:27):**  was included in the previous legislation.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:16:30):**  It was supposed to expire in 2020, but because of COVID, it has been extended for an extra

**[0:16:44-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:16:44):**  ministers from all of the member states, but is also received and partitioned out in different  
**[0:16:51-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:16:51):**  ways based on the agricultural policies of each individual country.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:16:56):**  Is that correct?  
**[0:16:58-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:16:58):**  Yes, you are having that correct.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:17:00):**  Of course, budgetary allocation is, I don't want to say a game because it is not a game,  
**[0:17:06-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:17:06):**  but it is a process in which agriculture is, I mean, you will never have enough money for  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:17:12):**  all your needs and wishes, whether that's agriculture or energy or whatever.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:17:18):**  So that will be always a matter of consensus between the ministers themselves within that  
**[0:17:25-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:17:25):**  industry and also other industries having certain claim on how the budget should be  
**[0:17:33-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:17:33):**  spent, but also proactively advocating for like, hey, you know, we see this reality changing  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:17:39):**  and now we need a budget to look like that.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:17:44):**  Let me, if I may, talk about principles of the cap.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:17:48):**  What is the cap trying to deliver on?  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:17:51):**  It is delivering on food security of European citizens.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:17:55):**  So the cap is not really, a farmer is not at the center of the cap.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:18:02):**  What is at the center or who is at the center of the cap is a citizen of the European Union,  
**[0:18:07-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:18:07):**  regardless of whether he or she is a farmer or a lawyer or bus driver.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:18:16):**  And that is rooted in the history that we share as what now is European Union or basically  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:18:22):**  Second World War and the famine that followed and all the difficulties and hardships that  
**[0:18:28-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:18:28):**  unfortunately our friends in Ukraine are experiencing right now.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:18:34):**  And that's why, well, EU has been a response or what now is the EU has been a response  
**[0:18:41-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:18:41):**  to this memory and food security was one of the key responses to that memory in particular.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:18:50):**  And that is seen in what the cap is right now.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:18:53):**  So it's focused on production, right?  
**[0:18:55-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:18:55):**  We want to be producing, we want to be food secure, calories wise.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:19:02):**  And that has positive and negative consequences.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:19:06):**  So within that motivation, how has that actually played out for farmers since it was initiated?  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:19:13):**  I mean, what we're essentially talking about here is a subsidy system, right?  
**[0:19:17-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:19:17):**  That incentivizes certain behaviors or certain actions and disincentivizes others with this  
**[0:19:23-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:19:23):**  overall goal of creating food security within Europe.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:19:27):**  But how has that actually worked out for farmers?  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:19:29):**  And you know this direct because of your involvement with farming in your home country of Poland.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:19:35):**  Exactly.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:19:36):**  And I think there is a two-sided answer to this great question, which is for our particular  
**[0:19:42-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:19:42):**  farming in Northern Poland, for Polish agricultural sector as such, and then for many farmers  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:19:50):**  that I know, it has been a huge success.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:19:55):**  What I mean by that is we would not be as well-functioning, as affluent farmers we are  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:20:05):**  right now, if not the cap, if not the financial support and also technical support provided  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:20:11):**  by the common agriculture policy.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:20:15):**  So it has been tremendous.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:20:18):**  We are a huge benefactor of the cap as a farm and as Polish agricultural sector that I can  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:20:24):**  speak to because I'm from there and I can see in my head a pathway that our agriculture  
**[0:20:30-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:20:30):**  would be on, if not the EU and the pathway with us being in the EU and therefore us being  
**[0:20:38-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:20:38):**  subject to the cap, the common agriculture policy.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:20:42):**  And I can tell you that where we are right now is indefinitely better than where we would  
**[0:20:48-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:20:48):**  be without the cap.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:20:49):**  However- Can I expand on that real quick?  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:20:52):**  Can you go into a little bit of detail about where you see those trajectories diverging  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:20:57):**  with or without the assistance or the participation of Europe?  
**[0:21:01-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:21:01):**  Yes.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:21:02):**  So first thing would be two things, access to modern technology, so ability to invest  
**[0:21:11-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:21:11):**  and therefore raise your level of production, which in the case of our farm was connected  
**[0:21:19-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:21:19):**  with increasing not productivity, productivity as well, but profitability, which is not really  
**[0:21:24-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:21:24):**  the metric that we talk about in agriculture a lot.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:21:28):**  We are, which is what I wanted to speak to next, like the metric used in agriculture  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:21:34):**  is productivity, not the, sorry, like how much you are producing, not how profitable  
**[0:21:39-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:21:39):**  you are.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:21:41):**  So financial literacy, and I'm sure you've already have spoken to that in your podcast  
**[0:21:47-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:21:47):**  or you will be speaking to that because it's a huge topic.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:21:49):**  It is really a challenge, right?  
**[0:21:52-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:21:52):**  Like, yeah, like it might make sense, nice you are achieving those yields, but like how  
**[0:21:56-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:21:56):**  much money are you actually making?  
**[0:21:58-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:21:58):**  Plus if we include all the externalities on top of that, the number might be also completely

**[0:22:06-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:22:06):**  But ability to invest has been dramatically changed, right?  
**[0:22:12-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:22:12):**  Like we would not have access to technology, both capital wise and market access wise,  
**[0:22:18-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:22:18):**  if not the European Union, which is my second point, market access point from being able

**[0:22:32-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:22:32):**  We are exporting hay to Germany, to Austria, to the Netherlands, which would be much more  
**[0:22:39-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:22:39):**  difficult if at all possible without the European Union.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:22:44):**  And kind of input wise, being tractors or other agriculture technologies, I'm sure that  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:22:51):**  if we would not be part of the European Union as Poland, access to those technologies would  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:22:56):**  be either much more limited and or expensive than it is right now.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:23:02):**  Which, I mean, indirectly speaks to your profitability as well, right?  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:23:10):**  Because if you have access to better technologies and or cheaper technologies, that has a material  
**[0:23:16-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:23:16):**  impact on your bottom line.

**[0:23:24-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:23:24):**  side.

**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:23:33):**  want to call it negative, but like side effects that are just a reality that we are experiencing  
**[0:23:38-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:23:38):**  at the farm level and more broadly at the systemic level, which are, I've already spoken  
**[0:23:47-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:23:47):**  to that a little bit, which is this focus also of the common agriculture policy, but  
**[0:23:53-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:23:53):**  this narrative is much broader than in the cup only, of talking about production, right?  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:24:00):**  Like we want to be producing calories.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:24:02):**  We are not really talking about economic viability of that production.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:24:09):**  And in particular with a growing body of knowledge and awareness and insights in how though on  
**[0:24:17-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:24:17):**  how this production in a current agricultural system that we are having is leading to environmental  
**[0:24:24-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:24:24):**  externalities and trying to measure those, we are starting to see that the agriculture  
**[0:24:31-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:24:31):**  production system that we are in is really not that resilient and sustainable.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:24:40):**  And I'm happy to say, you know, the trajectory of our farm and average farm differs here  
**[0:24:46-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:24:46):**  because we simply follow the pathway that very few farmers followed within the cup of  
**[0:24:51-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:24:51):**  transitioning to more sustainable.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:24:54):**  And then what we now like to think of as regenerative, but we are unfortunately a very unique farm  
**[0:25:02-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:25:02):**  from that perspective.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:25:05):**  And that brings us to, I guess, talking about challenges of the cup, which is, you can see  
**[0:25:11-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:25:11):**  that over years the cup is becoming more environmental.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:25:17):**  There are more and more conditionality measures as they are being called.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:25:21):**  So in order to be eligible for a subsidy, you know, you have to put a cover crop on  
**[0:25:28-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:25:28):**  part of your land.

**[0:25:38-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:25:38):**  we want to be producing, right?  
**[0:25:40-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:25:40):**  And now, especially with the war in Ukraine, the narrative is like, so what, like, do we  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:25:45):**  want to have environment or do we want to have food on our plates?  
**[0:25:50-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:25:50):**  Which as I'm sure, or maybe no, but like, I guess a lot of the recenters of that podcast  
**[0:25:56-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:25:56):**  will know this is not really the question we are faced with, right?  
**[0:25:59-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:25:59):**  Like we can have both and maybe even more so we need both because the state of our soil  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:26:06):**  is like, at least in Poland, and unfortunately that goes for a lot of other European countries  
**[0:26:11-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:26:11):**  as well, that state is declining, like in alarming ways.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:26:17):**  And alarming is like very, very nice word to be used.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:26:22):**  Right, it's definitely the case here in Spain as well.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:26:26):**  I just received an email earlier today, like informing me that in 14 out of 16 regions  
**[0:26:33-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:26:33):**  that Poland has, the water ships as they are called, or the equivalent of a land in Germany  
**[0:26:38-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:26:38):**  or state in the US, you know, in 14 out of 16, we have drought that has been measured  
**[0:26:45-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:26:45):**  and reported and verified and so on.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:26:48):**  And of course, you know, climate is changing.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:26:51):**  But if you have been as a farmer ploughing your field for the last 15 years, as most  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:26:56):**  of the farmers have, like, I'm sorry, but there's something to be done there, right?  
**[0:27:01-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:27:01):**  And the cap is trying to, I will use the word push farmers in that direction.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:27:10):**  And I think the challenge we are having, which is precisely where climate farmers fit in,  
**[0:27:14-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:27:14):**  and where my work at policy level fits in, is to change this mindset from pushing to  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:27:22):**  supporting, to enabling, to encouraging, right?  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:27:27):**  So that, as we've been talking in the past, we are not fighting, like this policy is not  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:27:32):**  fighting with the other one, but it's speaking with the other one.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:27:36):**  And here there's a tremendous role, from my perspective, of member states to be doing,  
**[0:27:43-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:27:43):**  right?  
**[0:27:44-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:27:44):**  Like the way common agriculture policy and other policies of the EU are being communicated  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:27:50):**  is that when something is hard, you know, it is this mythical Brussels that doesn't  
**[0:27:55-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:27:55):**  really exist.  
**[0:27:56-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:27:56):**  There's no mythical Brussels.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:27:58):**  There are certain political processes happening in Brussels, because that's where commission  
**[0:28:02-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:28:02):**  is located, that both the representatives, the ministers and relevant ministries, but  
**[0:28:10-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:28:10):**  also citizens themselves, they are participating in, or they are invited to participate in.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:28:17):**  And we have, and Ivo speaks to that brilliantly in our think tank sessions, we have planetary  
**[0:28:23-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:28:23):**  boundaries that we are crossing.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:28:25):**  The challenge is very clear and very pressing.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:28:30):**  And we have the opportunity to do something with that.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:28:33):**  And farmers are at the center of that response.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:28:37):**  And you know, if I achieve only one thing with this podcast is to like, making one farmer  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:28:43):**  feel like, oh, can I manage my land differently?  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:28:47):**  Can I move from being a manager of this land to being a steward of the ecosystem that has  
**[0:28:51-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:28:51):**  been entrusted to me?  
**[0:28:54-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:28:54):**  I've achieved my purpose, right?  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:28:56):**  Then we will do that with two or three or four farmers, as we are trying to do as climate  
**[0:29:01-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:29:01):**  farmers through our carbon plus certificates right now and other activities, even better.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:29:10):**  Sorry for talking so much.

**[0:29:12-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:29:12):**  This is really good.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:29:13):**  And so I'm trying to understand where the differences in implications of how this is  
**[0:29:20-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:29:20):**  rolled out in different countries has been at least up until now, maybe this is going  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:29:24):**  to change as governments tend to shift a lot quicker within each individual country within  
**[0:29:29-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:29:29):**  the European Union.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:29:30):**  But have you seen vast differences in how the money is being used or how it's being  
**[0:29:38-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:29:38):**  allocated in different parts of Europe?  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:29:42):**  Great question.

**[0:29:49-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:29:49):**  two years ago, but has been prolonged, we are not really seeing big differences across

**[0:30:17-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:30:17):**  And then the implementation with different amounts of money was adjusted at the national  
**[0:30:24-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:30:24):**  level.

**[0:30:34-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:30:34):**  rates.

**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:30:43):**  had higher rates for like area payments, right?  
**[0:30:47-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:30:47):**  Like for one hectare, you get X amount of euros.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:30:51):**  That was higher for Germany than it was for Poland for historical reasons.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:30:56):**  And once again, there was a process why that was the case.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:31:03):**  The cap that we are entering into since the beginning of next year will be significantly  
**[0:31:10-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:31:10):**  different from the perspective of the question you are asking, than all the previous caps.

**[0:31:21-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:31:21):**  So like, the decision is being made at the lowest level possible, that the EU, the ministers  
**[0:31:28-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:31:28):**  of agriculture will set priorities on what cap has to deliver at the union level.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:31:38):**  And then the specific design of the cap, the commercial policies, policies or policy, but  
**[0:31:44-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:31:44):**  a national level will be designed by the member states themselves.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:31:51):**  So this time the commission, the European Commission has not been proposing, you know,  
**[0:31:56-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:31:56):**  like, hey, this is what we want to deliver.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:31:59):**  And this is how we will be delivering that.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:32:02):**  But the commission with the ministers agreed, this is what we want to deliver on.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:32:08):**  And agency has been given to member states in order to propose an answer to how they  
**[0:32:15-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:32:15):**  want to deliver that through so-called national strategic plans, which were drafted early  
**[0:32:23-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:32:23):**  last year.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:32:24):**  They have been consulted in the member states throughout last year.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:32:30):**  After those consultations and some amendments that have been done in a few iterations in  
**[0:32:35-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:32:35):**  each member state, they have been submitted to the European Commission for assessment.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:32:41):**  That assessment has arrived back, I believe, on the 31st of March this year, but it has  
**[0:32:48-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:32:48):**  been published a little bit later.  
**[0:32:53-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:32:53):**  And now, so the commission has either said, either say, okay, we like it, it's ready for  
**[0:33:01-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:33:01):**  implementation or it said it still needs some work in order to be implemented, which, for  
**[0:33:08-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:33:08):**  example, that's what the commission said towards the Polish national strategic plan.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:33:14):**  And right now, like on the 27th of May, 2022, we are at the stage in which national governments  
**[0:33:23-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:33:23):**  are once again looking at the feedback provided by the commission and modifying if they have  
**[0:33:30-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:33:30):**  to or if they've been asked to, their national strategic plans to be resubmitted to the commission  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:33:37):**  so that before the end of this year, we have an agreement between the member state and  
**[0:33:42-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:33:42):**  commission how that strategic plan looks like.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:33:45):**  And so it will be implemented starting on January 1st next year.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:33:51):**  If I may say one thing about that process is that it has been positive.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:33:58):**  I mean, I have participated very actively in this feedbacking sessions with the Polish  
**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:34:03):**  Ministry of Agriculture and there was dialogue there.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:34:08):**  Of course, there are challenges with a process like that, which is participatory because  
**[0:34:12-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:34:12):**  you have a lot of feedback coming and you cannot satisfy everyone.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:34:17):**  But a big real challenge that I am seeing with the CAP is that if you consider CAP timeline,  
**[0:34:27-0:34:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:34:27):**  which the next one will be from 2023 to 2027, and you consider the timeline of our climate  
**[0:34:34-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:34:34):**  ambitions, which is net zero by 2050 at the very latest and 55% greenhouse gas emission  
**[0:34:42-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:34:42):**  reductions by 2030, there is a real challenge that agriculture will not be able to deliver  
**[0:34:53-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:34:53):**  as much as it could and in my personal opinion should on our climate efforts because the  
**[0:35:01-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:35:01):**  CAP that we are discussing right now and that will close very soon will finish in 2027.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:35:10):**  And then the next one will start in 2028, which will be only two years to 2030 in which  
**[0:35:17-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:35:17):**  really the biggest effort in terms of eliminating greenhouse gas emissions, which is mainly  
**[0:35:24-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:35:24):**  methane, which is energy and agriculture, should happen.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:35:31):**  And also within that, I'm seeing a huge just reality, not even a risk of divergence between  
**[0:35:38-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:35:38):**  different member states.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:35:40):**  So like one member state will be very advanced when it comes to promoting carbon farming,  
**[0:35:46-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:35:46):**  as we call it at climate farmers, some will be significantly less promoting of that for  
**[0:35:57-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:35:57):**  various reasons.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:35:58):**  And by the time we get convergence in that field across the EU climate science wise and  
**[0:36:07-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:36:07):**  our policy objectives wise, climate policy objective wise, therefore it will be significantly  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:36:15):**  harder to put climate farmers at the central climate change mitigation efforts in a profitable

**[0:36:29-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:36:29):**  it's not easy now and it will be only harder in 2027, 2028.

**[0:36:43-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:36:43):**  that space and in particular, like the stream of work that I am spearheading, which is the  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:36:49):**  political engagement, is so important because it's complex.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:36:54):**  It's easy to say we'll deal with that later because we still need something.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:36:59):**  We are not sure.

**[0:37:10-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:37:10):**  The timing is never good right now, unfortunately.

**[0:37:17-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:37:17):**  And the narrative that we as climate farmers would like to propose is that it's not a question  
**[0:37:23-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:37:23):**  of do you want to have calories on your food or do you want to have a resilient system?

**[0:38:13-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:38:13):**  However, you also expressed apprehension or perhaps even a little bit of disappointment

**[0:41:26-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:41:26):**  who were the two heads at the same time, those who happen to be in regulatory positions,

**[0:41:46-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:41:46):**  That's been reflected as well in the conversations that I've been having.

**[0:42:06-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:42:06):**  with the real challenges of modern farming.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:42:09):**  And you and I both understand just how broad that sector is.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:42:13):**  To call someone a farmer could be as diverse as someone who takes care of a fishery or

**[0:42:28-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:42:28):**  And to make any kind of policy decisions that are across the board, either positive or negative  
**[0:42:35-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:42:35):**  for such a diverse sector is very difficult.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:42:38):**  And it's it's not always sure that the people who are in a decision making role or a leadership  
**[0:42:45-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:42:45):**  role really understand the challenges of what people who are working on the ground face.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:42:51):**  Do you feel that's the case as well?  
**[0:42:54-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:42:54):**  I feel your I feel that the criticism or the like the the the feeling that you have expressed.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:43:03):**  And I hear that a lot.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:43:05):**  In my personal experience, I don't I don't share that because it happens that I'm working  
**[0:43:10-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:43:10):**  daily with people in this mythical Brussels and I think very highly of them.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:43:16):**  And also, as I understand the process, it's it's not about a decision.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:43:22):**  It's about processes that have some decision making points in those processes.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:43:28):**  Like we talked about the cup.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:43:29):**  It's on average or usually it's a seven year budgeting period.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:43:34):**  Right.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:43:35):**  Like that starts one day and finishes one day and there's a process and then you implement  
**[0:43:40-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:43:40):**  and then you have the next one.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:43:42):**  And like and and when somebody thinks, be they minister or being a farmer that like  
**[0:43:48-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:43:48):**  knows there's somebody making a decision that is like their decision.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:43:52):**  I don't share that view.

**[0:43:59-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:43:59):**  participate in.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:44:00):**  We talked about the public consultations as well.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:44:04):**  Right.

**[0:44:08-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:44:08):**  We have participated as a farm.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:44:10):**  We have participated that as European carbon farmers.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:44:14):**  We have participated in some others recently as climate farmers.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:44:19):**  And there are many more that are coming up because we simply understand that there's  
**[0:44:23-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:44:23):**  a there's a political process or there's a decision making process connected with developing  
**[0:44:29-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:44:29):**  carbon farming, carbon farming framework at the EU.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:44:33):**  And and for me, it's all about the agency.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:44:36):**  Right.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:44:37):**  So so when we are and which is also can be connected with my experience here in the US,  
**[0:44:43-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:44:43):**  the major difference that I'm seeing between the US agriculture, but also culture more  
**[0:44:49-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:44:49):**  broadly and my culture, Polish culture, is that when farmers meet or somebody meets here  
**[0:44:57-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:44:57):**  and they are talking, as they very often do, about challenges, the question that emerges  
**[0:45:02-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:45:02):**  after that conversation is not, OK, so what should somebody do in order to address this?  
**[0:45:08-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:45:08):**  Which, you know, in the European context, that would lead us to Brussels, like, OK,  
**[0:45:12-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:45:12):**  like then, like the Brussels with the next cap should do something better because this  
**[0:45:17-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:45:17):**  one is wrong.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:45:18):**  But the question that emerges in the US is what can we do given that?  
**[0:45:24-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:45:24):**  And I think this is fundamentally what we are about as climate farmers.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:45:27):**  Right.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:45:28):**  If there is like one thing that would tell me somebody is in a regenerative mindset.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:45:34):**  He or she is is owning stuff.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:45:38):**  Right.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:45:39):**  And she or he has agency to to to sometimes not do anything because you cannot do.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:45:46):**  But like you have this question in your kind of thinking process of like, OK, so therefore

**[0:45:53-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:45:53):**  Right.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:45:54):**  And you realize that you actually don't have to do that much because those processes are  
**[0:45:59-0:46:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:45:59):**  happening.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:46:00):**  And it's a matter of picking up a phone call and having a conversation.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:46:04):**  Because once again, the US is showing us, you know, you truly can do that and it works.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:46:10):**  And those are we all know that those are simple things.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:46:13):**  But when talking about the snowball effect, when you know, you add that up across a society  
**[0:46:20-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:46:20):**  that is not even mobilized, but like has agency, that's amazing.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:46:26):**  And that's why I've said, you know, I'm super excited about the new cap being designed in  
**[0:46:32-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:46:32):**  the structure that is delegated to the member states because it is following this very principle  
**[0:46:38-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:46:38):**  of of we want to involve more.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:46:41):**  We want to provide opportunities for acting on your agency.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:46:46):**  And then the criticism of that process is, you know, that agency is not there.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:46:51):**  And more often than not, there's not enough encouragement to take that agency.  
**[0:46:57-0:46:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:46:57):**  Right.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:46:58):**  Like like like you would be having those conversations.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:47:01):**  I mean, I'm having those conversations on like, hey, you can do that.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:47:04):**  Like, have you participated in this, this, in this other process?  
**[0:47:08-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:47:08):**  Right.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:47:09):**  Or if you were meeting with a minister of agriculture that, you know, I do sometimes  
**[0:47:15-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:47:15):**  that what would you say to him or her, him in the Polish case?  
**[0:47:22-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:47:22):**  And then the like very often, like, I don't get an answer that I can share with the minister.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:47:28):**  It's like, like, you should do his job better, right?  
**[0:47:31-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:47:31):**  Like, okay, like, we all know that.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:47:33):**  But like, what specifically does it mean?  
**[0:47:35-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:47:35):**  And that brings me to what I started with, which is the process, right?  
**[0:47:40-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:47:40):**  I don't expect you as a farmer.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:47:42):**  And this is what I often share about my job that I really would like to be driving a tractor  
**[0:47:46-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:47:46):**  for two months of a year and then doing something else for the next 10.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:47:51):**  That is not politics, because I wish that was happening already.  
**[0:47:56-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:47:56):**  But hey, I participated in certain processes that led me to be where I am.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:48:01):**  And I'm super privileged to be having a big responsibility in the job that I'm doing.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:48:08):**  But it's all about the process, right?  
**[0:48:09-0:48:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:48:09):**  I don't expect you as a farmer that is being asked for the first time in your life, what  
**[0:48:14-0:48:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:48:14):**  would you tell to your minister to have a, you know, a perfect answer.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:48:21):**  But what I hope for is that more and more of us will be, you know, like going through  
**[0:48:28-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:48:28):**  processes that basically lead us to this regenerative future that we want to see as climate farmers  
**[0:48:34-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:48:34):**  and others.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:48:35):**  There's a really interesting perspective.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:48:38):**  And, you know, we're just about out of time, I know you got a lot of work to get to.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:48:42):**  But I have one more question that hopefully will lead this into what I'm hoping is going  
**[0:48:46-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:48:46):**  to be an ongoing series where we can really pick apart some of the more detailed aspects  
**[0:48:51-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:48:51):**  of how agriculture is governed in Europe and how it affects people on the ground.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:48:57):**  What would you tell to farmers listening to this about what to expect in the next cap  
**[0:49:04-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:49:04):**  series or rollout that is different from what they might be used to?  
**[0:49:09-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:49:09):**  Is it really so different between member states that you'd have to speak to them individually?  
**[0:49:15-0:49:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:49:15):**  Or there are some general things that they should perhaps be aware of or prepare for  
**[0:49:19-0:49:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:49:19):**  this next phase of the cap?  
**[0:49:23-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:49:23):**  I would say great question.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:49:25):**  Thank you for giving me the opportunity to like reflect on that question and answer it.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:49:29):**  I would say be a leader and go beyond the cap as many of the farmers are already doing  
**[0:49:39-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:49:39):**  and run this thinking exercise in your head, which is what if cap was not there, how would  
**[0:49:45-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:49:45):**  my farm look like?  
**[0:49:48-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:49:48):**  And then maybe act on those insights.  
**[0:49:51-0:50:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:49:51):**  We didn't talk about that at all in this interview, but one of the huge elephants in the room  
**[0:50:00-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:50:00):**  is that we are no longer treating subsidies, including the cap, as something that might  
**[0:50:06-0:50:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:50:06):**  be, might not be there.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:50:08):**  It's like there is on my balance sheet of a farm.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:50:11):**  That's why we are US climate farmers.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:50:13):**  We need a transformation of the cap structure away from action-based payments in which we  
**[0:50:18-0:50:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:50:18):**  are in right now, which are kind of like, you are entitled to those.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:50:23):**  And this is the mindset that we are in to result-based payments in which we are paying  
**[0:50:29-0:50:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:50:29):**  for what we are delivering because we are delivering social goods and being paid from  
**[0:50:35-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:50:35):**  tax money and therefore we should really deliver on that social credit that the cap is also  
**[0:50:46-0:50:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:50:46):**  like having as part of its structure.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:50:49):**  And then also as climate farmers, we believe that that will lead the cap to be connected  
**[0:50:56-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:50:56):**  very efficiently with the climate policies that the EU has.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:51:00):**  And we would love to see transformation, a role of private carbon markets in that transformation  
**[0:51:06-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:51:06):**  process.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:51:07):**  And we would like to see at some point, hopefully soon, seeing private money flowing into that  
**[0:51:17-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:51:17):**  structure that the cap will enable.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:51:19):**  So right now we have private carbon market and we have the cap, which are not connected.  
**[0:51:25-0:51:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:51:25):**  The question is, how do you accelerate one transforming the other and make this work?  
**[0:51:32-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:51:32):**  And this transformation from action-based to result-based, we believe is the key to  
**[0:51:37-0:51:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:51:37):**  making that happen.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:51:39):**  And this is the political path that I and we are navigating politically basically.  
**[0:51:47-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:51:47):**  But my answer to the farmer would be, you are a leader, go beyond the cap, think what  
**[0:51:51-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:51:51):**  would happen if the cap is not there and I'm sure that will lead you to some insights.  
**[0:51:55-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:51:55):**  Talk with your friends, talk with the other farmers about those topics, even and especially  
**[0:52:00-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:52:00):**  if you disagree, that's amazing.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:52:03):**  And don't take that personally, but just as a thinking exercise, what do you think, what  
**[0:52:09-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:52:09):**  do you think, what would that look for your farm, for my farm, what would that look for  
**[0:52:13-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:52:13):**  our farms if the cap is not there or if you do this and I do this or we together do something.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:52:20):**  And one final thing I will say would be, you are a carbon farmer.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:52:28):**  If somebody told you you are not, or maybe you are not sure, you are a carbon farmer  
**[0:52:34-0:52:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:52:34):**  because your farm, whether you know it or not, and now you know it, whether you like  
**[0:52:39-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:52:39):**  it or not, and I hope you like it, is embedded in an ecosystem that has ecosystem services  
**[0:52:47-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:52:47):**  and ecosystem cycles or cycles of nature that are present in that ecosystem.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:52:52):**  One of those cycles is a carbon cycle.  
**[0:52:55-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mateusz-ciasnocha-on-understanding-the-coming-changes-to-the-european-common-agriculture-policy-cap/#t=0:52:55):**  The question is, are you decreasing that cycle, i.e. you are degenerative, are you keeping

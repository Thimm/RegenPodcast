### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 21 Apr 2017 13:53:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to this episode of The Abundant Edge, the podcast all about the worlds of  
**[0:00:04-0:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:00:04):**  natural building, permaculture, and regenerative living.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:00:08):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher and I have a fantastic interview for you today.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:00:12):**  So let's jump right on in.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:00:23):**  So I'm really excited about the interview.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:00:25):**  Today's guest is a good friend of mine who has recently become a member of The Abundant  
**[0:00:29-0:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:00:29):**  Edge team.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:00:30):**  His name is Neil Hegarty and he's the volunteer coordinator at Atitlan Organics here in Sununah,  
**[0:00:36-0:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:00:36):**  Guatemala.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:00:37):**  Now Neil grew up in Ireland and spent a lot of time around his uncle's dairy farm when  
**[0:00:41-0:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:00:41):**  he was young.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:00:42):**  He went on to study agriculture and science and began to learn more about alternative  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:00:47):**  methods of farming during his travels and volunteering on woof farms.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:00:51):**  He later went on to get his masters in agriculture and development studies.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:00:55):**  In this session we talk about many progressive agricultural techniques such as holistic land  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:00:59):**  management, silvopasture, strip grazing, and more.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:01:03):**  Neil also shares his experiences from managing volunteers from all over the world and how  
**[0:01:08-0:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:01:08):**  cattle farming can actually be good for the environment.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:01:11):**  Now don't forget to stick around at the end of this episode while I give some exclusive  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:01:15):**  information on new natural building workshops coming up as well.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:01:19):**  Now without further introduction, here's Neil.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:01:21):**  Hey Neil, thank you so much for joining us today.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:01:24):**  It's a pleasure to have you here.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:01:25):**  My pleasure, Oliver.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:01:26):**  Good to be here.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:01:27):**  Well, let's jump right in.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:01:29):**  Well, now we've known each other for a little while, but tell me a little bit about your  
**[0:01:33-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:01:33):**  background growing up in Ireland.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:01:35):**  Yeah, so I grew up in the countryside in Ireland.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:01:41):**  I was lucky that my uncle ran the family farm and I didn't grow up far from that.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:01:47):**  It was a dairy farm, but I spent a lot of time in that farm as a kid and young teenager.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:01:53):**  I learned a lot from my uncle.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:01:56):**  He was a conventional farmer in that he did put chemicals on the field, he spread slurry  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:02:05):**  on the field, which isn't like an overly standard recipe.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:02:09):**  He was a very good farmer.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:02:10):**  His attention to detail was excellent.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:02:14):**  I learned a lot about being around animals, about managing land.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:02:22):**  So while I don't know everything about the kind of farm that I was first exposed to,  
**[0:02:27-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:02:27):**  it was like 100% sustainable learning, that was a really good introduction.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:02:34):**  You know, I went to college and I did a general degree in science, but with a strong focus  
**[0:02:45-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:02:45):**  on agricultural science.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:02:48):**  So it wasn't exactly a degree in agricultural science, but it was, you know, damn close.  
**[0:02:54-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:02:54):**  We studied an awful lot of stuff around, especially to do with productivity, soil mineralogy,  
**[0:03:03-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:03:03):**  soil science, all that kind of stuff.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:03:06):**  I got a pretty good drenching in, let's say from a fairly young age.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:03:13):**  But definitely that degree and what I did in the aftermath had more of a conventional  
**[0:03:20-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:03:20):**  focus to them.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:03:23):**  So after I finished college, I traveled a little bit, I woofed on farms and I learned  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:03:32):**  a bit more about different styles of farming.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:03:37):**  But I eventually went back to Ireland having lived in Australia, New Zealand, Asia.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:03:47):**  I started working for an NGO and the work I was doing was mostly to do with designing  
**[0:03:58-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:03:58):**  and helping to implement what we call income generating projects that had to do with agriculture.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:04:06):**  So I got to see, I was based in Ireland, but I got to travel and see a lot of what were  
**[0:04:13-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:04:13):**  referred to as developing countries.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:04:20):**  I actually slowly became very disillusioned with that whole work and it was actually during  
**[0:04:27-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:04:27):**  my time in Guatemala back in 2009 where I was working with a group of coffee exporters.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:04:37):**  The really things, I guess it was like a slow process where everything I had learned up  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:04:41):**  to that point in my mid-twenties started to click together and I started to put the pieces  
**[0:04:46-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:04:46):**  together and go hang on a second, it doesn't make sense in my opinion for these people  
**[0:04:53-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:04:53):**  to continue that all of the work they do be focused around sending a cash crop back to  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:05:00):**  Europe or the United States so that people there can consume it while they feed themselves  
**[0:05:06-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:05:06):**  on processed food made in those countries.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:05:09):**  It didn't make sense to me that a lot of these development workers and do-gooders were leaving  
**[0:05:15-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:05:15):**  these projects, driving out to the highlands in big cars first of all and then leaving  
**[0:05:22-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:05:22):**  these projects and going back and doing their shopping in Walmart and actually feeding into  
**[0:05:29-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:05:29):**  the exact same system that they were supposedly trying to change.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:05:36):**  I then sort of slowly started to dawn on me that that kind of top dressing or that sort  
**[0:05:44-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:05:44):**  of surface dressing stuff that a lot of NGOs do is just not cutting it.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:05:54):**  It took me a long time to really fully put the pieces together.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:05:59):**  From there I went back and did about five years ago now.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:06:07):**  I did a masters in agriculture and development studies and I came back up to Guatemala now  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:06:15):**  three years ago to do my thesis on…  
**[0:06:18-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:06:18):**  I became very interested in I suppose throughout all this process the answers, the more I read,  
**[0:06:24-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:06:24):**  the more I studied, the more I thought about it.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:06:28):**  The idea of taking responsibility for my own life and my own actions before trying to tell  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:06:36):**  anybody else to take control of theirs became very appealing to me.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:06:40):**  So it really set an intention for myself to just go back to unlearn a lot of things, to  
**[0:06:48-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:06:48):**  kind of question everything and to give myself three or four years to really understand how  
**[0:06:54-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:06:54):**  to live more closely with nature and in a way that was more congruent with what I believed.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:07:03):**  So I came to EMAP, EMAP was one of the places I came to conduct my thesis, the Instituto  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:07:12):**  Americana de Tarmacultura, the Mesoamerican Pharmaculture Institute.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:07:17):**  So where's that based?  
**[0:07:19-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:07:19):**  That's in San Lucas, Tulumé, on the other side, leaving the district of Sololaf.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:07:28):**  And I decided to do an experiential thesis and the title of my thesis was The Relevance  
**[0:07:34-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:07:34):**  of Permaculture as a Play to Smallholder Indigenous Farmers in Guatemala.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:07:41):**  Now how did you actually get started in permaculture before that?  
**[0:07:44-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:07:44):**  I know you've been doing a lot of sort of alternative or maybe newer forms of agriculture.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:07:51):**  How did you come into permaculture specifically?  
**[0:07:54-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:07:54):**  I came across permaculture, there's an organisation called the Hollies in West Cork.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:08:03):**  They're one of the few permaculture practitioners in Ireland and I had gone out and studied  
**[0:08:08-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:08:08):**  a little bit with them.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:08:09):**  I'd done courses in a few different things.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:08:13):**  They actually teach a full two-year course in sustainability but I'd just done a few  
**[0:08:17-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:08:17):**  things.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:08:18):**  I'd done a cob building course.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:08:19):**  I'd done a couple of courses in mushroom propagation.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:08:23):**  I got on well with the guys and they had kind of switched me on to permaculture.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:08:27):**  I didn't actually do my permaculture design course with them but they switched me on to  
**[0:08:31-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:08:31):**  it and that was maybe five or six years ago.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:08:34):**  I remember a guy who runs it as a German guy and I was talking to him and I was sort of  
**[0:08:38-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:08:38):**  explaining.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:08:39):**  I'd just been in Latin America actually and I was talking about my experience there and  
**[0:08:44-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:08:44):**  this kind of lack of congruency as I saw it between the development workers and sort of  
**[0:08:51-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:08:51):**  their own lifestyles and he was a really impressive character and he just said to me, you're at  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:09:00):**  exactly the same age that I was at when I started joining these dots and making these  
**[0:09:05-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:09:05):**  connections.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:09:06):**  He was just like, just stick with it.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:09:08):**  I can't tell you what to do but just keep pulling on the thread.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:09:14):**  That's what I did and I came out to Guatemala, like I said, to do the thesis.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:09:19):**  So I travel around Guatemala and I talk to a lot of small scale farmers who were doing  
**[0:09:26-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:09:26):**  who had been capacitated in permaculture.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:09:30):**  It led me to EMAP and I ended up staying there as a volunteer and eventually they kind of  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:09:35):**  created a position for me for about a year and a half and really over that time I talked  
**[0:09:41-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:09:41):**  to a lot of small scale producers.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:09:43):**  I really went in depth into the principles and their application.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:09:48):**  I really started to hone my skills as a gardener and as a designer.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:09:54):**  I was very lucky there.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:09:55):**  I had some really good teachers who kind of took me under their wing and for me from the  
**[0:10:02-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:10:02):**  very start, permaculture was about much more than just a set of techniques to design a  
**[0:10:11-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:10:11):**  sustainable life for yourself.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:10:12):**  It was very much, I saw it as a calling and kind of as a way of life.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:10:19):**  So really living there, I felt like I got a great chance to really connect to this country  
**[0:10:24-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:10:24):**  and to this culture because I was living in rural Guatemala, essentially in a small indigenous  
**[0:10:31-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:10:31):**  community and I was very lucky, especially the local farmers there, they taught me a  
**[0:10:37-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:10:37):**  lot.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:10:38):**  A lot of people who are good at what they do, they're happy to share it.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:10:44):**  So from there then, I guess I'll just get you up to date on where we are.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:10:50):**  From there, our job came up in Antigua, Guatemala, managing a piece of property that a group  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:10:59):**  of people had bought with the intention of turning it into kind of a sustainable farm.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:11:04):**  It was an interesting project.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:11:06):**  I stayed there for the bones of a year.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:11:09):**  I had quite a large team of people working for me and my work there was really focused  
**[0:11:16-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:11:16):**  on earthworks and keyline design.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:11:19):**  It was like a mountainside.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:11:23):**  So again, it was a great learning experience and by the end of my year there, I felt like  
**[0:11:29-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:11:29):**  I learned an awful lot.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:11:30):**  It definitely made mistakes but they're not mistakes I'd make again and yeah, it turned  
**[0:11:37-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:11:37):**  out great.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:11:38):**  Actually, it was really affirming to manage a project of that size, 10-acre piece of property,  
**[0:11:45-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:11:45):**  sloping and to really just like I just applied the principles of moving slowly, building  
**[0:11:52-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:11:52):**  soil, slowing down water in any way you could, building diversity and it was really what's  
**[0:12:00-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:12:00):**  the word.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:12:01):**  It was really affirming to see how those principles, if you just follow them even if you're not  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:12:12):**  like hugely experienced, can really transform a landscape.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:12:18):**  Just those basics alone.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:12:19):**  Really just those basics.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:12:20):**  Without having to go anything too complicated.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:12:23):**  Focus on perennials, slow down the water, work on contour, get in animals, build soil.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:12:31):**  These are the things that you never really regret.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:12:34):**  You might make small technical mistakes here and there.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:12:38):**  You might bite off more than you can chew with a terrace and end up with a big slope  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:12:42):**  on the other side of it and have to redo it.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:12:46):**  You might have one or two animals get sick and die because you've worked with goats and  
**[0:12:50-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:12:50):**  not with sheep but applying the principles of starting a nursery and just propagating  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:12:57):**  every soil improving plant that you can get your hands on.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:13:01):**  Nobody ever regrets these things and that's kind of what I realised.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:13:05):**  I'd worked up slowly to that point I think to be able to manage this project and I felt  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:13:09):**  like it was the right time to take it on but I really realised and I say to people all  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:13:13):**  the time now, look if you're intimidated, if it seems like a big property, whatever,  
**[0:13:17-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:13:17):**  whatever, whatever, I've seen people regret putting their house or a permanent structure  
**[0:13:23-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:13:23):**  in a place that's facing the wrong way or in an area that collects too much water and  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:13:29):**  these things definitely take time with them but I've never met anyone who's like I wish  
**[0:13:33-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:13:33):**  we didn't make all that compost, I wish we hadn't propagated all those nitrogen fixing  
**[0:13:40-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:13:40):**  plants.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:13:41):**  Those are things that you really can't go wrong with.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:13:44):**  You can't go wrong, you know, getting animals, lash down hay and straw under them, you know,  
**[0:13:53-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:13:53):**  add water, turn it over, compost your scraps, compost every organic thing you can get even  
**[0:13:59-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:13:59):**  if it's just sitting in a pile until you figure out what to do with it.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:14:08):**  And so those things you literally can't go wrong with those and bit by bit you get more  
**[0:14:12-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:14:12):**  refined at it.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:14:13):**  For sure.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:14:14):**  Now I know you know a little bit more about some other practices that kind of complement  
**[0:14:21-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:14:21):**  permaculture in more detail.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:14:23):**  For those who are less familiar with concepts like holistic land management and ideas like  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:14:29):**  silvopasture, could you explain a little bit more about these ideas and how they work?  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:14:33):**  Yes, do you want me to talk specifically about those techniques or just about the wider?  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:14:38):**  I guess I would say first of all like on that.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:14:42):**  So we'll start with a holistic land management.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:14:44):**  We've talked a lot about that ourselves.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:14:46):**  Yeah, I mean like so all permaculture really is at a basic level, okay, this is what I'm  
**[0:14:56-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:14:56):**  starting to realize with permaculture.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:14:57):**  At a basic level it's really just a very good synthesis of a lot of different, of a lot  
**[0:15:04-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:15:04):**  of good agricultural practices taken from all over the world and kind of put together,  
**[0:15:11-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:15:11):**  yeah?  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:15:12):**  So and that's why I think that principle work from the patterns to the details is a very  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:15:17):**  important one that maybe some people overlook.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:15:20):**  So it's like if you're getting into permaculture you don't need to be an expert in silvopasture,  
**[0:15:28-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:15:28):**  holistic land management, just rotational grazing, market gardening.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:15:35):**  You don't need to be an expert in any of these things, biointensive farming, whatever.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:15:41):**  Just know that they're there.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:15:43):**  Know that they're there, understand them and have confidence in yourself to be able to  
**[0:15:47-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:15:47):**  look up the details of them.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:15:49):**  We're now living in a digital world.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:15:51):**  It doesn't make sense anymore to go to college and study all of the different things that  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:15:58):**  could be considered permaculture for four years and try and memorize them because you  
**[0:16:02-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:16:02):**  won't remember them anyway, right?  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:16:04):**  So the reason permaculture education is so kind of I think inspiring and effective is  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:16:10):**  that you're really just teaching people how to see things a little differently.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:16:14):**  You're broadening their perspective and you're giving them like a toolkit, yes?  
**[0:16:20-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:16:20):**  You're saying like so specifically silvopasture, holistic land management are great tools if  
**[0:16:27-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:16:27):**  you find yourself with like a large reasonably flat piece of land where it's maybe badly  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:16:34):**  eroded, it's been really badly managed and you want to get it.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:16:38):**  You want to A, make it productive and B, heal it.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:16:43):**  Then knowing some of the details about these techniques can be usual.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:16:47):**  Then you go look them up.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:16:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:16:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:16:50):**  Then get on St. Google and have them bestow some knowledge.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:16:54):**  In a sense, yeah.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:16:56):**  For example, like holistic land management, I'll get into the details on these things  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:16:59):**  later but holistic land management is kind of a funny one to me because I heard about  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:17:04):**  it and people were all excited about it and I watched a presentation on it and then I  
**[0:17:10-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:17:10):**  just went, well, that's just what my uncle always did on the farm.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:17:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:17:16):**  All holistic land.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:17:17):**  It's just got a fancy name.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:17:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:17:19):**  He called it strip grazing.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:17:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:17:21):**  So you divide up your pasture, your grassland into small sized enclosures.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:17:29):**  You leave the cattle there for one day, then you move them to the next one.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:17:34):**  They defecate everywhere.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:17:37):**  They stomp on the ground.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:17:38):**  Their hoof prints create seed beds.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:17:41):**  The grass grows way better after they leave.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:17:44):**  It's just mimicking a natural pattern.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:17:47):**  Allen Savory stuff is really good on this for anyone who wants the details but again,  
**[0:17:52-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:17:52):**  understanding the pattern is always more helpful.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:17:54):**  So essentially what you would have in the wild is something like a savanna land.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:17:59):**  A load of buffalo would come in there.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:18:01):**  They would stay huddled together to have safety in numbers and any herbivore if you watch  
**[0:18:06-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:18:06):**  them, they like to stay close together.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:18:08):**  They don't care about sightseeing or really too much personal space.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:18:13):**  They want to be together reasonably bunched because it gives them a sense of security  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:18:19):**  and then in the wild, natural predators would just move that group of herbivores on to the  
**[0:18:24-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:18:24):**  next area.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:18:26):**  What will always happen or almost always is that they would be followed by an omnivore.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:18:33):**  In the case in the wild, it would be some kind of a bird that actually cleans the body  
**[0:18:39-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:18:39):**  of the buffalo and looks at hunts for different kind of bugs in the feces and all that kind  
**[0:18:46-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:18:46):**  of stuff, performs a different action on the land, also defecates on it with a higher nitrogen  
**[0:18:53-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:18:53):**  concentration.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:18:54):**  So you are really just sort of copying that natural pattern.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:18:58):**  For example, Joel Salatin's approach of moving cattle through a land and following them with  
**[0:19:04-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:19:04):**  heirloom chickens works great.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:19:07):**  Mark Sheppard proposes like having a follow the leader rotational grazing system where  
**[0:19:13-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:19:13):**  cattle are followed by maybe sheep or goats, followed by hogs, followed by chickens.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:19:21):**  Basically what you try and do is create a symbiosis between the pasture and the animals.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:19:27):**  So the pasture feeds the animals, the animals feed the pasture.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:19:30):**  So understanding those kinds of symbiosis is, that's the real challenge.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:19:42):**  That's important to people because I think we have an education system that's very focused  
**[0:19:45-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:19:45):**  on people memorizing details rather than people understanding larger patterns and concepts.  
**[0:19:52-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:19:52):**  So the symbiosis between a pasture and a herbivore is the same as the symbiosis between a tree  
**[0:20:03-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:20:03):**  and a flock of birds.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:20:05):**  One gives habitat, the other lives there, fertilizes, eats potentially harmful maggots  
**[0:20:14-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:20:14):**  from around the tree.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:20:16):**  You know, it's the same as the symbiosis between beans and a corn stalk.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:20:23):**  Once you understand these, one puts nitrogen, the other provides a climbing frame.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:20:28):**  Everything goes to create these closed loop cycles.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:20:30):**  It's not even about closed loop.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:20:31):**  It's about setting things up so that one, that idea of like every element is supported  
**[0:20:39-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:20:39):**  by, sorry, every element should fulfill at least three functions and be supported by  
**[0:20:48-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:20:48):**  other elements.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:20:52):**  The more positive kind of interrelationships that you can create in a system, the stronger  
**[0:20:59-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:20:59):**  that system would be.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:21:00):**  So I guess getting back to holistic land management and rotational grazing, the real beauty of  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:21:07):**  these things is that I think the challenge for anyone who doesn't understand this, for  
**[0:21:12-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:21:12):**  anyone who's like really trying to figure this out is how can we feed ourselves with  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:21:23):**  a much strong higher reliance on perennial systems.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:21:27):**  And by perennial systems, I mean trees and grasses and shrubs that do not need to be  
**[0:21:35-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:21:35):**  replanted.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:21:36):**  So a lot of people, a lot of my environmentalist friends drive around Ireland and they say  
**[0:21:42-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:21:42):**  God this is terrible, all this cattle farming, all these grasslands, we could be growing  
**[0:21:49-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:21:49):**  vegetables and this and why is everyone so obsessed with meat and dairy.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:21:57):**  And it's not that cattle managing, that cattle farming is bad, especially if it's grass-fed  
**[0:22:04-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:22:04):**  cattle it can be actually a wonderful thing.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:22:07):**  The problem with it is, you know my uncle says part of the conditions and the subsidies  
**[0:22:13-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:22:13):**  that he got was involved getting a bonus or having the condition of taking out any excess  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:22:21):**  vegetation that wasn't grass essentially.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:22:26):**  So any trees, instead of having live hedgerows that are full of blackberries and briars to  
**[0:22:33-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:22:33):**  divide up.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:22:34):**  And the animals that are attracted to them.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:22:35):**  You know and the animals that are attracted to them, you get them all out and you place  
**[0:22:38-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:22:38):**  them in an electric fence.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:22:40):**  So silvopasture really is just, it's a beautiful, because if you have your land covered with  
**[0:22:46-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:22:46):**  grass all the time, that is protected soil, it's erosion-proof, it is the most sustainable  
**[0:22:55-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:22:55):**  thing, style of farming, you're getting big herbivores to turn those inaccessible calories  
**[0:23:02-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:23:02):**  into meat, skins, milk, cheese, you know all those things.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:23:10):**  Now, and where silvopasture comes in is you combine that with agroforestry.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:23:17):**  So instead of dividing up your fields with electric fencing, plant trees and hedges on  
**[0:23:23-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:23:23):**  contour, have your property circulated by a large area of forest to break the wind,  
**[0:23:31-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:23:31):**  to provide firewood, integrate fruit trees and medicinal plants in there.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:23:39):**  And that, you know, massively increase the biodiversity, but don't throw the baby out  
**[0:23:45-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:23:45):**  with the bathwater.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:23:46):**  Like, recognise the actually ingenious part of domesticating cattle, because properly  
**[0:23:53-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:23:53):**  managed and fed what their proper diet is, which is grass, these herbivores can be fantastic  
**[0:24:00-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:24:00):**  allies in us, because how else are we going to feed ourselves?  
**[0:24:05-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:24:05):**  There's only so much fruit you can eat, there's only so many perennial, until they invent  
**[0:24:11-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:24:11):**  perennial versions of all of our staple grains, there's only so much we can get for perennials  
**[0:24:15-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:24:15):**  without the help of these big animals.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:24:18):**  You know for us on the farm it's goats, there's an awful lot of mountainous terrain here,  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:24:24):**  an awful lot of shrubs and bushes and all kinds of leaves and we basically feed it all  
**[0:24:30-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:24:30):**  to the goats, you know, they browse and like I say, they're turning that, they're turning  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:24:36):**  that inaccessible energy very efficiently into extremely accessible energy for us.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:24:42):**  Yeah, so I talked about that really well when I interviewed him on his show, about how the  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:24:47):**  goats are sort of the cornerstone of all of the operations that go on on the farm.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:24:52):**  Everything is sort of routed through them one way or another and they transform a lot  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:24:57):**  of products, they help to facilitate a lot of the work and some of the other functions  
**[0:25:02-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:25:02):**  of the farm and that in most cases there's some sort of animal input that is the cornerstone  
**[0:25:09-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:25:09):**  of the majority of the operations on a sustainable farm operation.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:25:13):**  I mean without the animals we wouldn't have farm up there, we would have no chance of  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:25:19):**  growing or producing anything without the animals.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:25:23):**  Like, you know, slowing down the water and terracing the land and getting the wetlands  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:25:29):**  and those perennial food forests set up, they look great, they're beautiful, they create  
**[0:25:34-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:25:34):**  lots of habitat for birds but it's not until you integrate animals into them that you get  
**[0:25:39-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:25:39):**  the real symbiosis.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:25:40):**  So it's like if you look at that, all of the food forests have a little house built inside  
**[0:25:48-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:25:48):**  of them with rotating doors where either chickens can range around under the trees or pigs can  
**[0:25:55-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:25:55):**  range under the bigger trees.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:25:57):**  The goats we don't actually let range in there, they go walking off the land of the farm but  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:26:01):**  again loads of the stuff, loads of the lovely trees that are growing in there we use as  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:26:06):**  cut and carry for the goats and then vice versa, all of the animals are on top of the  
**[0:26:11-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:26:11):**  deep bedding system with straw and all of that manure continually goes out into the  
**[0:26:18-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:26:18):**  vegetable beds under the trees.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:26:21):**  So it's like the two are working in very, again symbiosis is the word there, you know.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:26:28):**  And goats are fantastic because really in a sense a kind of rule of thumb is the larger  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:26:35):**  the animal the easier it is to feed it without grains.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:26:41):**  Very hard to manage, have any kind of egg production with chickens without some kind  
**[0:26:46-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:26:46):**  of grain that you've got to get somewhere.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:26:49):**  Very easy with a goat or a cow.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:26:53):**  Despite the fact that we mostly feed them in industrial agriculture, just corns and  
**[0:26:57-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:26:57):**  other things.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:26:58):**  Right but unfortunately we've slipped into this kind of bizarre situation today where  
**[0:27:02-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:27:02):**  I can take terrible quality grains like really awful stuff that are put in these animal concentrates.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:27:15):**  I can give a small amount of those grains to a chicken that also gets like greens from  
**[0:27:20-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:27:20):**  the garden, also gets, you know our chickens will eat the leftovers of the goats that we  
**[0:27:25-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:27:25):**  slaughter.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:27:26):**  So you know it will get protein in all kinds of forms, it will get kitchen scraps, it will  
**[0:27:31-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:27:31):**  get all the greens that we cut from the garden that we don't want for ourselves and it will  
**[0:27:36-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:27:36):**  get like a supplementary dose of grains, mostly soya and corn, not very sustainably produced.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:27:46):**  But that's what we can get here in Guatemala.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:27:49):**  We take that and it gets transformed into eggs or meat which are like very nourishing  
**[0:27:57-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:27:57):**  to us.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:27:58):**  And you have this bizarre situation where now I think you have a lot of people seeming  
**[0:28:03-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:28:03):**  to think that vegetarianism or veganism is an appropriate ecological response to the  
**[0:28:09-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:28:09):**  situation we're in.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:28:11):**  And it's not to attack these people but it's just to make them question that you're really  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:28:17):**  still eating those grains, you're just eating them yourself and probably needing to eat  
**[0:28:22-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:28:22):**  a lot more of them.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:28:23):**  To get the same nutritional value.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:28:24):**  To get the same nutritional value, this is not in any way meant to defend concentrated  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:28:31):**  feedlots or industrial farming which is horrendously inefficient.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:28:36):**  But you know if you can get, really the challenge for us at the moment is to get the animals  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:28:42):**  on a diet, on as low an input diet as we can.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:28:47):**  You know and it's much easier with the goats than it is with the chickens.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:28:53):**  So let's change gears just a second because I know you have other functions on the farm.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:28:57):**  Your main job at Atitlán Organics right now is managing the volunteers and apprentices  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:29:01):**  that regularly come from all over the world to participate and learn from the success  
**[0:29:05-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:29:05):**  of the farm.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:29:07):**  How have you managed such a wide range of abilities, work ethics and even languages?  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:29:14):**  Well that part of it really comes quite easily.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:29:20):**  I think to me of course there's challenges.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:29:25):**  It's a good exercise in compassion building because you realize that everybody who comes  
**[0:29:30-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:29:30):**  here is coming at this from a different place.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:29:33):**  You get some amazing experienced farmers and you know guys who are guys and girls who are  
**[0:29:44-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:29:44):**  like really good with their hands, you know have all these kinds of interesting skills  
**[0:29:47-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:29:47):**  to offer and you get 19 year old, 20 year old high school students who are people who  
**[0:29:51-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:29:51):**  are just out of high school who have never even seen a show or a show or a shovel before.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:29:58):**  Thankfully most, it's very rare that somebody comes through here that doesn't either speak  
**[0:30:01-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:30:01):**  Spanish or English so that's a blessing.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:30:08):**  The language one isn't too much of an issue.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:30:12):**  I guess my philosophy when it comes to managing people all the time is try and give them space  
**[0:30:21-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:30:21):**  to do what they're good at.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:30:24):**  Try and find the things that people gravitate naturally towards that they're happy when  
**[0:30:33-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:30:33):**  they're doing.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:30:34):**  And with a volunteer who's here for like a couple of weeks, most people come for a short  
**[0:30:40-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:30:40):**  term volunteer, yeah they want to learn but they also want to have fun.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:30:44):**  And like a lot of a lot of a lot of permaculture is like it's making, it's about making farming  
**[0:30:49-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:30:49):**  enjoyable and fun again.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:30:50):**  It is hard work sure like when we, you know we, especially when we're doing earthworks  
**[0:30:55-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:30:55):**  and carrying bags of compost around and all that kind of stuff, it's hard work but it's  
**[0:31:00-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:31:00):**  generally good fun you know.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:31:03):**  And I mean for me the key all the time is that is that is being humble.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:31:13):**  You never know, a lot of people surprise you, you know a lot of people will come here and  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:31:18):**  you think, you know you'll make a judgment just like everybody does.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:31:22):**  And really like one thing that gives me a lot of hope for the future is the amount of  
**[0:31:28-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:31:28):**  23, 24 year old kids now I'm meeting who are like who are switched on.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:31:35):**  They get it, they're politically aware, they're aware of the kind of growing ecological crisis  
**[0:31:41-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:31:41):**  in a way that I never was.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:31:45):**  They're opting to instead of going to expensive universities, they're opting to take a couple  
**[0:31:50-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:31:50):**  of years out to go to come places like this to learn natural building, to learn permaculture  
**[0:31:55-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:31:55):**  and so yeah you know it's a good experience and yeah not I mean not always easy but for  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:32:12):**  the most part it's something I enjoy and I always feel you know I feel grateful to anybody  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:32:17):**  who comes to our farm with wanting to put energy into it.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:32:22):**  So you have to respect that, yeah you have to and again that like putting aside the thing  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:32:29):**  of wherever this person's at if someone's willing to come and put energy into your land  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:32:33):**  you have to treat that with the respect it deserves and try and make sure that even if  
**[0:32:38-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:32:38):**  they're only here for a week, two weeks, whatever that they learn something you know and that  
**[0:32:41-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:32:41):**  there's a real give a sense of give and take.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:32:44):**  Yeah that's really good advice because I know a lot of people who start their own land-based  
**[0:32:48-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:32:48):**  projects especially in permaculture and others are usually looking to student or volunteer  
**[0:32:53-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:32:53):**  labor for at least a portion of what they're trying to accomplish over the years and I  
**[0:32:57-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:32:57):**  think taking into account all the different types of volunteers and people who come on  
**[0:33:02-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:33:02):**  and how to interact with them always helps out with that.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:33:05):**  I mean I say not on that I would say that anybody who's really looking to do this don't  
**[0:33:11-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:33:11):**  depend on volunteers.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:33:12):**  Right so it changes the relationship a lot too.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:33:15):**  It does and as great as it is to have volunteers come to your land you need to I would urge  
**[0:33:21-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:33:21):**  anybody to design, design is everything you know design your system and your lifestyle  
**[0:33:27-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:33:27):**  in a way that you think you can actually manage it and by that I mean don't get goats, pigs,  
**[0:33:37-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:33:37):**  chickens, a food forest, a silvopasture area and you know and vegetable beds and think  
**[0:33:45-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:33:45):**  that you can manage all that with volunteer labor.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:33:48):**  Make sure that you and the people you're living with and maybe the people you're employing  
**[0:33:53-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:33:53):**  that if you have to go three months without having anybody volunteer on your farm that  
**[0:33:58-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:33:58):**  you can manage it.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:33:59):**  Ideally you know the nice thing about the farm up here is we all take turns every now  
**[0:34:04-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:34:04):**  and again at manning it on our own or with one other person.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:34:07):**  Shad's leaving in a couple of weeks and it's just going to be me and Nicolas and so you  
**[0:34:15-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:34:15):**  know we need to be able to get up at six in the morning and do everything on the farm  
**[0:34:19-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:34:19):**  from start to finish on our own and that's really important.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:34:22):**  And having those redundancies built in are also really important so the fact that he  
**[0:34:26-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:34:26):**  can get away for however many weeks or that one of you you know can respond to either  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:34:30):**  emergencies or vacations whatever it happens to be and your operations don't fall apart.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:34:35):**  It's really important to build those in.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:34:36):**  So your volunteer labor essentially then is about doing the bonus extra stuff.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:34:42):**  Sure.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:34:43):**  Great we've got six volunteers coming this week and we've got a new piece of land that  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:34:47):**  isn't terraced yet and could be really productive if we had six people working on it for two  
**[0:34:52-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:34:52):**  weeks and we know we have that so we plan for that.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:34:55):**  So the volunteers more do the additional bonus work.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:35:01):**  The stuff that you wouldn't be able to get to in as quick a time if you didn't have them.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:35:05):**  That's a good way to look at it.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:35:07):**  Now do you see the potential for permaculture to expand in Guatemala over the next five  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:35:14):**  years and if so how would that shape out?  
**[0:35:18-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:35:18):**  Right I mean I came I'll go back I guess a little bit to my story.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:35:22):**  I came to Guatemala this second time around because I had been here back in 2009 and I  
**[0:35:29-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:35:29):**  really credit my trip with Guatemala with opening my eyes enormously in terms of it  
**[0:35:36-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:35:36):**  was the first place that I really started to see the way the effect of the global kind  
**[0:35:43-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:35:43):**  of economic system particularly around food production has had such a devastating effect  
**[0:35:48-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:35:48):**  on this country.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:35:49):**  You're talking about one of the richest countries in the world in terms of biodiversity things  
**[0:35:56-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:35:56):**  that it can grow.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:35:57):**  You know within an hour from here I can find coconuts, pineapples, cacao, coffee, radishes,  
**[0:36:08-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:36:08):**  broccoli, cabbage and everything in between all you know you have a phenomenal abundance  
**[0:36:15-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:36:15):**  because of the changes in altitude in a way Guatemala you talk about the edge that's the  
**[0:36:21-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:36:21):**  name of your website.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:36:24):**  Guatemala is a great example of the edge effect.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:36:26):**  It's like it's the edge between two major oceans.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:36:30):**  It's the edge between two huge continents and so it has this like extraordinary diversity  
**[0:36:39-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:36:39):**  and richness not just in agriculture but in culture.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:36:43):**  You're talking about a country where there's still 23 languages spoken.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:36:49):**  Indigenous Mayan languages.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:36:50):**  Indigenous Mayan languages but these people have suffered greatly I think for the richness  
**[0:36:56-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:36:56):**  that their country has.  
**[0:36:57-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:36:57):**  They've been exploited for generations.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:36:59):**  And so I think permaculture is extremely relevant everywhere in the world but nowhere is it  
**[0:37:05-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:37:05):**  like more promising than here because my hope is that the more people that come here and  
**[0:37:14-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:37:14):**  learn and do what we're doing here and apply these principles places very quickly in this  
**[0:37:22-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:37:22):**  climate turn into an oasis.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:37:23):**  You have rain, you have lots of springs of water, you have an endless number of fruit  
**[0:37:29-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:37:29):**  trees and medicinal plants and grasses that will take hold.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:37:34):**  It's a good climate for lots of different types of animals and really if I use principles  
**[0:37:38-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:37:38):**  very very quickly you get a huge turnaround.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:37:42):**  So you know the sky is the limit I think in terms of permaculture in Guatemala.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:37:50):**  It's just attitudes will have to change and they'll have to change from the bottom up.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:37:57):**  So the good you know we're selective here about the volunteers we take on and that we  
**[0:38:06-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:38:06):**  tend to cap it at a certain number but we I will never say no to Guatemala.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:38:16):**  I'll tell an American student I'm sorry we're full but even if we have 10 volunteers in  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:38:21):**  the farm and even if there's no space to guest us if somebody from Guatemala calls and says  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:38:26):**  they want to come and hang out and work at the farm and learn I'll never say no.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:38:31):**  And one of the really gratifying things I guess over the last three years is that I've  
**[0:38:35-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:38:35):**  worked with some really bright switched on young Guatemalan guys and girls who've taken  
**[0:38:45-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:38:45):**  this stuff back to the city or the suburbs where they live and started urban gardens  
**[0:38:52-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:38:52):**  and even just have like and you never that's interesting about this work you never really  
**[0:38:57-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:38:57):**  know where it's going.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:38:59):**  You know every group of 20 students you have you have one of them might go back and start  
**[0:39:06-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:39:06):**  at a 10 acre food forest.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:39:08):**  You know you just you just don't know.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:39:11):**  So that's why also like taking if you're really serious about it honoring and respecting the  
**[0:39:19-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:39:19):**  people who come to volunteer here and to learn here is absolutely fundamental.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:39:25):**  So there's huge potential here.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:39:29):**  The economic system is still in no way in its favor.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:39:33):**  You know the political class the all the rest of it I don't think they see it.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:39:39):**  I don't think they get it yet.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:39:41):**  I don't think it's their fault that they don't get it.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:39:43):**  I think they've been indoctrinated into a way of thinking and seeing the world that  
**[0:39:48-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:39:48):**  just isn't really developed enough or advanced enough to deal with the problems that we have.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:39:59):**  You know we just listened to the president the other day and he was talking about how  
**[0:40:02-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:40:02):**  he's working hard to get more jobs for Guatemalans and you know those jobs are mine sweatshops.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:40:12):**  Call centers.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:40:13):**  Call centers.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:40:14):**  This is not what the country needs but you know it puts a band-aid on it for a while  
**[0:40:20-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:40:20):**  and get some reelected.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:40:22):**  Probably you know and that's the level he's coming at and actually that's you know that's  
**[0:40:25-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:40:25):**  the big thing I've learned in practicing permaculture is that it does it does really demand you  
**[0:40:32-0:40:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:40:32):**  teach you and demand you to be tolerant.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:40:35):**  Sure you know and so even I can imagine working with so many different types of people from  
**[0:40:39-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:40:39):**  different backgrounds really helps with that as well.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:40:42):**  Even observing your own journey you know that's the thing you know because I'm 35 now I look  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:40:46):**  back on where I was when I was 25 and I realized wow this guy was an idiot.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:40:51):**  I think anyone paying attention would look back on certain portions of their life with  
**[0:40:57-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:40:57):**  the same critique.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:40:58):**  I would hope so you know but then it also means that when you meet someone who genuinely  
**[0:41:02-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:41:02):**  looks like an idiot in that moment it's easier for you not to judge them not to get you know  
**[0:41:09-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:41:09):**  I was very lucky I had some really good teachers in my life I had a couple of experience switched  
**[0:41:15-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:41:15):**  me on to certain ideas and certain things none of which I actually get to take credit  
**[0:41:19-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:41:19):**  for.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:41:20):**  So but anyway going back to like permaculture as a whole like in a way you know my thesis  
**[0:41:29-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:41:29):**  had a specific focus on the on the indigenous peoples of this of this country in a way the  
**[0:41:36-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:41:36):**  rural indigenous people in this country are like almost already the perfect potential  
**[0:41:42-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:41:42):**  permaculture practitioners you know they're already planting loads of food they don't  
**[0:41:50-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:41:50):**  they don't do it brilliantly or sorry some of the times they do they're brilliant with  
**[0:41:55-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:41:55):**  their hands they're used to growing planting their own food they're used to walking up  
**[0:42:01-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:42:01):**  the mountains cutting down firewood bringing back down the mountain and they're used to  
**[0:42:08-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:42:08):**  trying to use and save every every everything that they can they tend not to be particularly  
**[0:42:14-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:42:14):**  wasteful because there's no room for it no clearly what has happened and I don't want  
**[0:42:21-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:42:21):**  to go into this too much but a lot of their knowledge systems around farming have been  
**[0:42:25-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:42:25):**  like fairly brutally attacked and and you could debate the reasons for why that was  
**[0:42:31-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:42:31):**  all day long but I mean you're talking about an area that built you know both here and  
**[0:42:37-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:42:37):**  South America extraordinarily complex advanced agricultural systems ways of producing food  
**[0:42:45-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:42:45):**  the people here were never were no strangers to terracing to complex irrigation systems  
**[0:42:53-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:42:53):**  the Chiampa the Chinampa the 20-year rotation of the milpa system going back into forest  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:43:00):**  all these things that there's ample evidence documenting all these knowledge systems have  
**[0:43:05-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:43:05):**  been wiped out in a sense I think it was done whether it was intentional or not it was done  
**[0:43:12-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:43:12):**  with the very much with the with the goal of taking people who produce food for themselves  
**[0:43:21-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:43:21):**  and turning them into producers of commodities for us and really that process started 500  
**[0:43:27-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:43:27):**  years ago and it hasn't actually stopped which is you know again my reason for one I didn't  
**[0:43:33-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:43:33):**  want to be involved in income generating projects that helped people to keep exporting coffee  
**[0:43:40-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:43:40):**  or chocolate or whatever and earn four dollars a day instead of two dollars a day that was  
**[0:43:44-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:43:44):**  not that was not going far enough so I think but all all that said and even though all  
**[0:43:57-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:43:57):**  of you know now you see people corn on the sides of 50 degree slopes they don't terrace  
**[0:44:02-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:44:02):**  they don't do anything to prevent erosion and but you know any of these people you talk  
**[0:44:10-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:44:10):**  to almost 80% of them will nod at you and say I I me abuela loises or something like  
**[0:44:20-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:44:20):**  my grandfather did it like that or I've seen that before and they take to it very quickly  
**[0:44:25-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:44:25):**  you know that was a really gratifying thing for me about working in Antigua where I had  
**[0:44:29-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:44:29):**  these guys and once I explained to them how to terrace properly how to hold water in the  
**[0:44:35-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:44:35):**  land they just got it straight away yeah okay they're not that far removed from it they're  
**[0:44:39-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:44:39):**  very close to it you know yeah there's been a real influx of processed foods a real encouragement  
**[0:44:46-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:44:46):**  of of people selling cash crops as opposed to growing food themselves but there's still  
**[0:44:51-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:44:51):**  nobody in rural Guatemala is more than a generation away from subsistence farming so and with  
**[0:44:58-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:44:58):**  the bite with the diversity here and with people's willingness to change because that's  
**[0:45:02-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:45:02):**  the other thing I see in Guatemala is that you maybe don't have in your open estates  
**[0:45:06-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:45:06):**  is that people here will will grab on to change if when they see good examples of it you know  
**[0:45:13-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:45:13):**  because it's really not working that well for most people here yeah the way things are  
**[0:45:18-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:45:18):**  sure they can see the difference between their lifestyles and others around the world maybe  
**[0:45:22-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:45:22):**  a bit different if you're working for a multinational back in Dublin and you've got a Volvo and  
**[0:45:26-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:45:26):**  you've got a you know you might have doubts about the meaning in your work and you might  
**[0:45:31-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:45:31):**  get frustrated but you know there's nice restaurants another new Volvo to work for a trip to Spain  
**[0:45:40-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:45:40):**  and you know there's things to keep you know so like I I'm cautiously optimistic as well  
**[0:45:49-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:45:49):**  sure sure so now what do you think are some of the things that permaculture and the permis  
**[0:45:54-0:46:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:45:54):**  community in general can do to help to expand its reach and its appeal especially in communities  
**[0:46:00-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:46:00):**  like this so we're in an interesting situation here because basically both Shad and I came  
**[0:46:05-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:46:05):**  at this thing from a similar position which was I don't want to tell anybody what to do  
**[0:46:10-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:46:10):**  until I'm doing it myself I don't want to tell anybody I don't want to go into a community  
**[0:46:16-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:46:16):**  and managing and set up a composting system until I'm not producing any organic waste  
**[0:46:22-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:46:22):**  myself I don't want to go in and talk about rubbish collection and recycling until I can  
**[0:46:27-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:46:27):**  genuinely say that no rubbish is leaving my land I don't want to talk about nutrition  
**[0:46:32-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:46:32):**  until I'm growing all my own food or getting or sourcing it sustainably somewhere else  
**[0:46:37-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:46:37):**  and little by little we've actually got to that point now here you know we're we're growing  
**[0:46:44-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:46:44):**  an awful lot of our own food what we can't grow ourselves or we don't have room to grow  
**[0:46:49-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:46:49):**  or to claim it to grow we're getting it more and more in bulk from from good producers  
**[0:46:55-0:47:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:46:55):**  elsewhere and now so now the goal for us and we we've both talked about this is is to help  
**[0:47:05-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:47:05):**  to spread this stuff out so for example we get a lot of volunteers here every month usually  
**[0:47:11-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:47:11):**  they work on the farm but we've more or less got to the farm the farm to the point where  
**[0:47:17-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:47:17):**  it's kind of running itself so starting next month we're starting our first pilot project  
**[0:47:23-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:47:23):**  where we're doing a course we've got eight participants and the practical work and the  
**[0:47:28-0:47:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:47:28):**  stuff that they do is going to be on the land of local people here and essentially our idea  
**[0:47:34-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:47:34):**  is to look for funding we won't need a huge amount but look for funding and start redirecting  
**[0:47:42-0:47:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:47:42):**  the volunteer labor and the the kind of I guess design experience that me and Shad and  
**[0:47:49-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:47:49):**  a few others here have got and to start directing that volunteer labor onto people's land and  
**[0:47:57-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:47:57):**  just helping them with the because the hard part about this is getting your land set up  
**[0:48:01-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:48:01):**  earthworks on rocky hilly land which is what we have here are tough I wouldn't do it if  
**[0:48:07-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:48:07):**  it was just me I've always done it either with people working for me or volunteers I  
**[0:48:13-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:48:13):**  sure as hell if I was a struggling indigenous farmer probably not even have time to do these  
**[0:48:20-0:48:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:48:20):**  things so we want to help people to get their land set up to be able to produce this kind  
**[0:48:26-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:48:26):**  of abundance that we're seeing in our land and then we want to incorporate them into  
**[0:48:30-0:48:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:48:30):**  a wider cooperative yeah so we want to basically share our knowledge and our labor with willing  
**[0:48:36-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:48:36):**  participants that's the other thing that I'm absolutely fundamental on so we're very lucky  
**[0:48:41-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:48:41):**  here to have Nicole last who's that who's a local guy he's the manager of the farm he's  
**[0:48:45-0:48:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:48:45):**  worked our farm he's worked shads farm for eight years really this guy's probably one  
**[0:48:50-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:48:50):**  of the best permaculture lists in the world in that he grew up he left school when he  
**[0:48:55-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:48:55):**  was I don't think he went to school at all speaks self-taught very patchy Spanish but  
**[0:49:03-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:49:03):**  this guy's a genius he can build a house with natural materials he can he can manage all  
**[0:49:11-0:49:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:49:11):**  of the different animals he's a good butcher he's a great gardener he'll build your wall  
**[0:49:17-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:49:17):**  while you're standing there drinking a cup of tea out of out of rocks he finds in the  
**[0:49:22-0:49:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:49:22):**  street and it won't fall over you know yeah you know this guy's a genius he gets it he's  
**[0:49:27-0:49:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:49:27):**  really excited about it everything he's learned with Chad he's implemented in his own land  
**[0:49:32-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:49:32):**  which is why shad has kind of got him back to a four-day work week so he has three work  
**[0:49:36-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:49:36):**  three days to work in his own stuff but with him and the contacts he has in the community  
**[0:49:42-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:49:42):**  you want to slowly start to set up local people to become to essentially permify their land  
**[0:49:51-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:49:51):**  and set up a kind of a centralized co-op for that and I'm really confident that if we can  
**[0:49:57-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:49:57):**  start applying these principles and really just working a model that we know works we  
**[0:50:04-0:50:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:50:04):**  can completely regreen this whole valley this valley that we see around us here now where  
**[0:50:08-0:50:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:50:08):**  you've got a road at hillsides poor looking soil in three four years if we can get enough  
**[0:50:16-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:50:16):**  funding and enough volunteers we can actually make a huge impact in this area and hopefully  
**[0:50:24-0:50:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:50:24):**  set up because my hope is that if we can do it well enough in this small community and  
**[0:50:30-0:50:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:50:30):**  then people who come here we can say look this is what can be done and there's other  
**[0:50:33-0:50:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:50:33):**  communities Kisha is a great example of one they did it completely on their own an indigenous  
**[0:50:38-0:50:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:50:38):**  community on the way out of solar land the way down to the coast they've been working  
**[0:50:43-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:50:43):**  there for about 27 years the place in oasis it's in the middle of all these coffee and  
**[0:50:50-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:50:50):**  sugar cane monocultures and it's you know this area maybe 20 acres 20 30 acres of beautiful  
**[0:51:00-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:51:00):**  terraces lush food forests watercress fish snails abundance of of beans and grains you  
**[0:51:13-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:51:13):**  know these guys are killing it yeah and some model example models wrote there and really  
**[0:51:19-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:51:19):**  for me it's just about creating at the moment you talk to permaculture with a skeptic and  
**[0:51:24-0:51:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:51:24):**  they'll sit and they'll listen to you and they'll say yeah but you know how are you  
**[0:51:29-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:51:29):**  going to convince anybody to stop growing a cash crop or export you know there's no  
**[0:51:34-0:51:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:51:34):**  money in that right and so and you know you try and make the case about you know that  
**[0:51:39-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:51:39):**  it's about you know money comes in other forms if your food is good you're not getting sick  
**[0:51:43-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:51:43):**  that's a that's a benefit that you don't necessarily see straight away or you know if you have  
**[0:51:48-0:51:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:51:48):**  a good life and all these things but it's hard to get it through to people but really  
**[0:51:52-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:51:52):**  for me that the the idea is to work small not try and stretch yourself too thin put  
**[0:51:59-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:51:59):**  a number of years into a piece of land and then a community and then bring people and  
**[0:52:07-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:52:07):**  show them to it and if enough people do that in enough communities honest honest sort of  
**[0:52:12-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:52:12):**  a small to medium scale then I think the evidence becomes overwhelming yeah it's all that tipping  
**[0:52:18-0:52:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:52:18):**  point I think it reaches a tipping point where I think even the most skeptical capitalist  
**[0:52:24-0:52:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:52:24):**  person looks at this valley where we've been doing permaculture work for five years even  
**[0:52:29-0:52:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:52:29):**  right now you look at Chad's farm it's like this green jewel in the middle of an arab  
**[0:52:34-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:52:34):**  desert if you can take that and apply it to the entire community and then it gets compared  
**[0:52:38-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:52:38):**  to like our neighbors in San Marcos or Jai Belito and people go there's literally not  
**[0:52:44-0:52:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:52:44):**  one sensible argument that can be made to say that this is not a good idea and not worth  
**[0:52:49-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:52:49):**  funding and not worth supporting so for me that's the that's the real goal you know yeah  
**[0:52:55-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:52:55):**  that's fantastic and especially like you said reaching out and including the rest of the  
**[0:52:58-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:52:58):**  community in this as well if they want of course and giving them examples to follow  
**[0:53:04-0:53:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:53:04):**  rather than just stories and hearsay and stuff like that because that speaks so much louder  
**[0:53:08-0:53:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:53:08):**  well so that was we could say almost just a really big introduction for the fact that  
**[0:53:16-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:53:16):**  you're joining on with abundant edge as well yes could you tell us a little bit about some  
**[0:53:21-0:53:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:53:21):**  of the projects that you've done in the past and how you might be able to help other people  
**[0:53:24-0:53:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:53:24):**  in the future with their land-based projects well I mean like I said the big the big one  
**[0:53:31-0:53:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:53:31):**  for me in in in Antigua was was took place all last year but also with with EMAC we implemented  
**[0:53:42-0:53:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:53:42):**  hundreds well I would say dozens of sort of small scale gardens and and school gardens  
**[0:53:54-0:54:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:53:54):**  done with done along the lines of permaculture principles I was very fortunate to to collaborate  
**[0:54:01-0:54:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:54:01):**  and work in a project last year with an NGO called G22 where we set up a their architects  
**[0:54:10-0:54:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:54:10):**  and natural builders and we we worked with a small with a family a rural family on the  
**[0:54:17-0:54:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:54:17):**  out well I would say yeah rural but kind of on the outskirts of Guatemala City going down  
**[0:54:23-0:54:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:54:23):**  towards Carretera Salvador and the idea was to design and implement a and a a living area  
**[0:54:35-0:54:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:54:35):**  or sorry a small house built with natural cheap or natural affordable materials and  
**[0:54:41-0:54:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:54:41):**  integrate the house with the garden so we basically built them a very simple bamboo  
**[0:54:48-0:54:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:54:48):**  structure with recycled materials for the roof little bit of concrete adobe baccarat  
**[0:54:57-0:55:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:54:57):**  style in in the building we put and then we integrated everything from roof water collection  
**[0:55:03-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:55:03):**  to a grey water treatment to to black water treatment we we integrated all that into the  
**[0:55:11-0:55:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:55:11):**  garden and on a on a small area maybe like 50 square meters we set we we set that family  
**[0:55:19-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:55:19):**  up with a design that could be copied really by any family with with small or scarce resources  
**[0:55:26-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:55:26):**  for a cost of around $5,000 we estimated which really is not very much money you know and  
**[0:55:33-0:55:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:55:33):**  compared to the living conditions for your average guatemala family in that kind of economic  
**[0:55:39-0:55:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:55:39):**  bracket it was it was a wonderful project to work on we ended up winning a national  
**[0:55:44-0:55:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:55:44):**  award for it I then went on and collaborated with with the same NGO G22 on on a project  
**[0:55:53-0:56:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:55:53):**  up in in a place called Salama which is it's known as the Coro Seco the the dry corridor  
**[0:56:00-0:56:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:56:00):**  so we're currently working on the implementation of that but that actually involves a lot of  
**[0:56:04-0:56:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:56:04):**  things you're talking about rotational grazing agroforestry silvopasture which are there  
**[0:56:11-0:56:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:56:11):**  it's a different climate it's flatter but it's a lot drier so you're talking about really  
**[0:56:15-0:56:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:56:15):**  really badly a road desertification is really creeping into this area because they don't  
**[0:56:20-0:56:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:56:20):**  get the rains that we get here so we're implementing that I'm very I'm very excited and hopeful  
**[0:56:26-0:56:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:56:26):**  about it the funding has actually tied us up a little bit on that one and so yeah that  
**[0:56:34-0:56:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:56:34):**  those are the kind of prototype models that I'm really like excited to work on and hopefully  
**[0:56:39-0:56:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:56:39):**  I really enjoy collaborating with other people you know like you who have maybe like a slightly  
**[0:56:45-0:56:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:56:45):**  different focus but a similar like large holistic view I find people like that always very easy  
**[0:56:53-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:56:53):**  to work with because it's really it's just with this stuff it's really just a it's a  
**[0:56:57-0:57:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:56:57):**  case of penny drops yeah once the penny drops as soon as I talk to you about an idea maybe  
**[0:57:01-0:57:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:57:01):**  you haven't heard the details of the idea but you'll get it you know you see where you're  
**[0:57:06-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:57:06):**  trying to move it or what the big picture outcome is yeah that ability to kind of look  
**[0:57:10-0:57:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:57:10):**  out and look at the big picture is and those are the types of people that I want to work  
**[0:57:13-0:57:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-013-neal-hagarty/#t=0:57:13):**  with and and and I'm excited and interested in working with so fantastic well like I said

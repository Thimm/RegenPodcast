**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:00:13):**  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:00:25):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this  
**[0:00:29-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:00:29):**  week's episode, so let's jump right in.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:00:59):**  Alright, welcome everyone.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:01:18):**  Continuing with this series on reforestation and agroforestry, I got the chance to speak  
**[0:01:23-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:01:23):**  with Peter van Midwoud, the lead tree planting officer of the search engine company Ecosia.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:01:29):**  Now I've been using Ecosia as my default search engine for a couple of years now because  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:01:33):**  of their claim to plant trees around the world with the profits from ad revenue every time  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:01:37):**  you search, but I wanted to know more about their tree planting initiatives and how they  
**[0:01:42-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:01:42):**  actually work.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:01:43):**  In this interview, Peter and I start by talking about how Ecosia as a company functions, and  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:01:48):**  how the simple act of searching the web with their service can support reforestation initiatives  
**[0:01:53-0:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:01:53):**  around the world.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:01:54):**  We then go into detail about how funding is distributed, and how Peter and his team vet  
**[0:01:59-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:01:59):**  different partner organizations that they support.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:02:02):**  He also unpacks some of the difficult and often unknown risks behind poorly planned  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:02:07):**  and executed tree planting projects, the difference between tree plantations and healthy forests,  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:02:12):**  the importance of promoting biodiversity, the social aspects that determine the success  
**[0:02:17-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:02:17):**  of new forests, and much more.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:02:19):**  We even get into the indirect ways of supporting native reforestation, without ever planting  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:02:24):**  a tree by protecting damaged landscapes and creating the conditions for forests to reseed  
**[0:02:29-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:02:29):**  themselves on their own.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:02:31):**  I was really impressed with the holistic and context-based approach to ecological regeneration  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:02:35):**  that Ecosia has.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:02:37):**  After researching many different reforestation initiatives for this series, I found very  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:02:42):**  few organizations that addressed the needs of local communities and biodiversity over  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:02:46):**  arbitrary numbers and targets for success, especially following up on the success or  
**[0:02:51-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:02:51):**  failure of a project and publishing the results transparently.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:02:54):**  I've included a few extra links in the show notes for this episode that examine and analyze  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:02:59):**  Ecosia's model and the accountability of their projects.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:03:03):**  As always, you can find all of them at abundantedge.com.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:03:06):**  Now I'll hand things over to Peter.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:03:08):**  Hey Peter, thank you so much for taking the time to be with me here today.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:03:12):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:03:13-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:03:13):**  I'm doing well, really well.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:03:15):**  Thank you.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:03:16):**  Man, I've been looking forward to speaking to you for a while because you have one of  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:03:19):**  the coolest job descriptions that I've heard of in a while, especially as it relates to  
**[0:03:24-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:03:24):**  this series on reforestation that we're doing in the podcast.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:03:27):**  So what do you say we just jump right into the questions?  
**[0:03:30-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:03:30):**  Let's do it.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:03:31):**  Yeah, looking forward to it.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:03:32):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:03:33):**  All right, well, so let's start with the beginning.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:03:34):**  Could you tell me a little bit about your personal background and how you became the  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:03:38):**  lead tree planting officer for Ecosia?  
**[0:03:43-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:03:43):**  So I am from the Netherlands.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:03:45):**  I was born in the Netherlands, close to a city called Arnhem and this is actually the  
**[0:03:50-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:03:50):**  area where there's still the biggest forest in the Netherlands.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:03:53):**  And indeed where I lived, we were like one minute away from the forest.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:03:56):**  So, you know, in the weekends we were very often between the trees.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:04:00):**  And when it was towards the end of the nineties and I had to pick my study, I knew I, there  
**[0:04:06-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:04:06):**  were many things I really liked, but forests and trees, I was really fascinated by that.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:04:12):**  And I wanted to understand ecology and how all these systems work.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:04:15):**  So this is why I studied forest and nature conservation in the Netherlands.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:04:19):**  And during my studies, of course, I learned that it's not so much ecology or technology  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:04:27):**  that determines whether trees or forests are in a certain place, but it's really people  
**[0:04:31-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:04:31):**  that determine that.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:04:32):**  So my forest and nature conservation study also became a kind of a social and a policy  
**[0:04:37-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:04:37):**  study.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:04:38):**  So I kind of got specialized in both areas, the minor in the one and the major in the  
**[0:04:44-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:04:44):**  other.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:04:45):**  After that, I worked for a couple of years to set up quality standards for reforestation  
**[0:04:48-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:04:48):**  projects.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:04:49):**  And I'm now going fast forward until in 2016, I found a job at from Ecosia that was looking  
**[0:04:57-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:04:57):**  for a tree planting officer.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:05:00):**  I first was like, okay, what's this?  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:05:04):**  It sounded cool, but it also sounded pretty weird actually.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:05:08):**  So I looked into it and I saw the job description and I didn't know Ecosia.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:05:14):**  So I learned what Ecosia is actually doing, you know, that through the normal business  
**[0:05:18-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:05:18):**  of having a search engine, they collect money and they use that money to plant trees.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:05:24):**  And still I found it a little bit atypical and I was like, that tree planting is claimed  
**[0:05:29-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:05:29):**  by so many organizations.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:05:30):**  This is really kind of the direction I want to go in my life.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:05:33):**  Till I realized that it's really genuine what they're doing, that they actually have quite  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:05:37):**  a lot of money available and that this is a company that was set up to plant trees through  
**[0:05:43-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:05:43):**  a search engine.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:05:44):**  So it was not a search engine that needed some kind of green offset to show that they  
**[0:05:49-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:05:49):**  also do something good.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:05:50):**  No, the whole purpose of the company was to make the tree planting possible.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:05:54):**  So I got really enthusiastic when I learned all that.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:05:56):**  So then I applied for a job.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:05:58):**  I got a job as first tree planting officer at Ecosia.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:06:02):**  And from then on, this was September 2016, I've been kind of structuring their portfolio.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:06:07):**  I've been working to actually create a vision, you know, where do we want to plant trees?  
**[0:06:11-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:06:11):**  How do we plant them?  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:06:13):**  All these things really from the, say the high level vision to the nitty gritty operational  
**[0:06:18-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:06:18):**  stuff.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:06:19):**  And I personally really liked to work on both ends and to see how I would say abstract visions  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:06:26):**  become reality on the ground to bridge those two is something I really like.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:06:30):**  So yeah, now it's 2019.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:06:34):**  Ecosia has about 25 reforestation projects, restoration projects worldwide that we are  
**[0:06:40-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:06:40):**  supporting.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:06:41):**  My team is a little bit bigger now.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:06:42):**  I have one other tree planting officer and we have a regenerative agriculture specialist  
**[0:06:46-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:06:46):**  in my team.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:06:47):**  But actually we have a lot of partners, you know, the 25 partners that we work with and  
**[0:06:53-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:06:53):**  I almost consider them to be my team because I'm touched with them very frequently.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:06:57):**  You know, it always goes in waves, sometimes a bit more than a bit less again.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:07:02):**  And even wider, the team has all the people working in the field.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:07:04):**  So yeah, it's been a big journey, but this is where I came from and this is where I'm  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:07:08):**  now and we've planted 70 million trees so far.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:07:12):**  And I'm really proud of that.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:07:14):**  And it's hard work, but I'm really proud.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:07:17):**  Yeah, as you should be.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:07:18):**  Those are some stunning statistics.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:07:20):**  So before we start to unpack kind of what the projects entail and what you do on the  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:07:25):**  ground, let's start from the beginning by talking about what Ecosia is and what sets  
**[0:07:29-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:07:29):**  it apart from other search engines.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:07:32):**  As I said, Ecosia was never set up to just create another search engine.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:07:37):**  When Christian, our founder, founded Ecosia, it was because he was traveling in the world  
**[0:07:44-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:07:44):**  and he saw that a lot of deforestation is happening and he thought, okay, we need to  
**[0:07:47-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:07:47):**  think how can we create a mechanism that's going to create money to reverse this process?  
**[0:07:55-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:07:55):**  And so he set up, I think for some longer time already, the idea to have a search engine  
**[0:08:02-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:08:02):**  for collecting money for something good.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:08:05):**  So this is where things came together.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:08:07):**  So he set up Ecosia as a vehicle to make money to plant trees.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:08:12):**  And I think this is really extraordinary.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:08:15):**  So Christian was not a forester, he didn't study forest, he studied economics.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:08:18):**  And I think that's cool because it shows if you kind of work outside of your normal comfort  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:08:23):**  zone, people can have really, really strong ideas.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:08:27):**  So this is where it all started.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:08:29):**  And since then, Ecosia has been developing and yeah, we're in some countries now, the  
**[0:08:35-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:08:35):**  second search engine after Google.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:08:39):**  We're still very small compared to Google, but we have a big, big potential and more  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:08:43):**  people that are concerned about the environment, concerned about the future that we have.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:08:48):**  They now choose to use Ecosia because they understand that everything you do, whether  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:08:57):**  it's buying something, whether it's going on a trip somewhere, you're spending your  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:09:01):**  money and it means you're making decisions about how you want the world to look.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:09:06):**  And this sounds like I studied this sentence for years, but this is really, really how  
**[0:09:10-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:09:10):**  it is.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:09:11):**  And as you mentioned, of course, Google is still the search engine, which is the default  
**[0:09:18-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:09:18):**  pretty much the world over.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:09:20):**  Why would someone want to switch and what differences will they notice?  
**[0:09:24-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:09:24):**  Is there any compromise in how searches are done or is it more or less the same?  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:09:31):**  I would say it's more or less the same when it comes to the search results perspective.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:09:36):**  So I mean, it's really improving over time.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:09:39):**  So when I used to go there for the first time three years ago, I would say results were  
**[0:09:43-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:09:43):**  not as good as they are today.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:09:45):**  There will always be a slight difference because, you know, Ecosia is not only the search engine  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:09:50):**  that plants trees, but we're also very privacy friendly.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:09:54):**  So we do not store searches that are made for more than a couple of days.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:10:00):**  And we also do not link an idea to those searches.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:10:04):**  So not like Google, we're not creating a profile about who is it that is searching for this.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:10:09):**  And you know, at the moment that you search for baby clothes, one year later, we will  
**[0:10:14-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:10:14):**  also propose you a nice bed for your baby.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:10:16):**  We do not have these profiles.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:10:17):**  So it means that we always have to compromise a little bit on the search results because  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:10:22):**  we know you're not as good as Google knows you.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:10:25):**  And that is something what I would say is a reason to use Ecosia.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:10:31):**  The other reason you want to use Ecosia is we're generally planting trees with the money.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:10:36):**  We have an income now of close to 2 million euros a month.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:10:41):**  And half of that is used to plant trees.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:10:44):**  So it goes into a fund and from that fund, we take our money to plant trees.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:10:48):**  And that's an amazing impact that we're having on the lives of thousands of people in this  
**[0:10:55-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:10:55):**  world but also on fauna and flora.  
**[0:10:57-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:10:57):**  And this is very real.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:10:59):**  I'm Ecosia's tree planting officer.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:11:01):**  I visit this project.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:11:02):**  I am in the field.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:11:03):**  I shake hands with people that plant the trees.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:11:05):**  I plant trees with them.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:11:06):**  This is really happening.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:11:09):**  And I think that's very powerful.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:11:11):**  And it is so motivating to work for a company which purpose it is to do things like this,  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:11:19):**  to do something good for the world instead of filling pockets of shareholders.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:11:25):**  It's what makes me wake up every morning that I know that this is the kind of thing I'm  
**[0:11:28-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:11:28):**  working on.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:11:29):**  And many of my colleagues say the same thing.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:11:32):**  So yeah, this is really the difference between Ecosia and Google.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:11:37):**  And this is the reason why you should switch to Ecosia.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:11:41):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:11:42):**  Well, so tell me exactly how Ecosia turns searches into trees.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:11:47):**  I know for a lot of people who, you know, this isn't running as a charity.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:11:52):**  And I know transparency in business, especially socially conscious or ecologically conscious  
**[0:11:59-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:11:59):**  businesses like this is important.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:12:01):**  So walk me through the process of what is the way that they make money and how is that  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:12:05):**  directly translated into trees in the ground.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:12:11):**  So when you search for something online, there's people who organizations, companies that show  
**[0:12:19-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:12:19):**  you advertisements or that want their products to be advertised next to your search results.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:12:27):**  And this is how Google makes its money and this is how Ecosia makes it money.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:12:31):**  And sometimes some of the ad first, which is very often the first or the second search  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:12:36):**  results you will get, you know, they work very well for you.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:12:41):**  They're exactly what you need.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:12:42):**  And so you click on that link.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:12:44):**  And on that moment, Ecosia makes a little bit of money.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:12:48):**  Not much, but it's a little bit.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:12:51):**  And this money is then sent to Ecosia.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:12:56):**  So once a month, the totals of this advertisement kicking money comes into our account.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:13:03):**  And we use that money, which is, as I said, by now about two million euros a year, which  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:13:08):**  sorry, a month, which is, you know, if you think about how often do you actually take  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:13:12):**  them ads, me personally, not so often.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:13:14):**  So a lot of people are actually doing it.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:13:17):**  So it is a business that really works.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:13:19):**  This is about two million euros every month.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:13:21):**  Now, this is higher than it's ever been.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:13:24):**  We're now two million euros.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:13:25):**  And so we first deduct all the different costs we're having.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:13:27):**  We're having costs for renting our office, we're having salaries that need to be paid.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:13:31):**  We have a number of servers that are running.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:13:35):**  We are investing in renewable energy because we want our servers to run on renewable energy.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:13:41):**  That has a cost.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:13:42):**  We are having marketing and communication to make Ecosia more famous and have more users  
**[0:13:47-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:13:47):**  so we can employ more.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:13:48):**  So all these costs get deducted.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:13:51):**  And from the money that remains, we say that 80% is used to plant trees.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:13:58):**  And I say we say because actually in practice, it's more like 90%, sometimes even 100%.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:14:04):**  And we also try this chunk to always be close to 40 to 50% of our turnover, you know, because  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:14:13):**  we could say, yeah, 90% of our profits is used for trees.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:14:16):**  We just don't make any profits because we spend it all on other nice things.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:14:19):**  Now that's how we work.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:14:20):**  We try this to be like 40 to 50% of our monthly turnover.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:14:24):**  Now that money goes into a fund, which we call our tree planting fund.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:14:28):**  And from that fund, we pay our partners to plant trees.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:14:35):**  Sometimes the money goes directly to the partners and skipping the fund, but most of it actually  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:14:38):**  goes through the fund first.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:14:40):**  And this tree planting is a result of a contract that I have made with a partner in the country,  
**[0:14:47-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:14:47):**  let's say in Burkina Faso, one of our biggest projects.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:14:50):**  So I have a contract with them at the beginning of every year, which is normally after the  
**[0:14:55-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:14:55):**  rainy season.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:14:57):**  Then we make a plan and a budget and a cash flow for, okay, how many trees do we want  
**[0:15:02-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:15:02):**  to plant together?  
**[0:15:03-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:15:03):**  What does it entail?  
**[0:15:04-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:15:04):**  You know, what activities do they have to do?  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:15:07):**  They have to prepare the grounds, they have to buy the seeds, they have to work with communities.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:15:11):**  So a plan is made.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:15:13):**  And at the end of that plan, a budget is made.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:15:17):**  And a certain number of trees will be planted under this contract in a particular timeframe,  
**[0:15:21-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:15:21):**  normally a year.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:15:22):**  And then during the year, we pay the invoices that our partner sends us for the work they  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:15:28):**  have been doing from the tree fund.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:15:32):**  So that is really how it works, because they send us the invoice for the work that they  
**[0:15:35-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:15:35):**  have been doing.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:15:36):**  And, you know, halfway or towards the end of the contract, that is a number of trees  
**[0:15:40-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:15:40):**  that they have been planted.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:15:42):**  And also when that has been done, we again get an invoice and we pay our partner for  
**[0:15:46-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:15:46):**  it.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:15:47):**  So this is important to me, this detail, which may sound like a detail, but we're not just  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:15:52):**  donating money to organizations because they plant trees.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:15:58):**  We have a plan, we have a budget, and we have a contract on how many trees in which timeframe.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:16:04):**  And this is super important because, well, you know, if you put a dollar in the ground,  
**[0:16:11-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:16:11):**  no trees will grow.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:16:12):**  So if we make more and more money, it doesn't mean that if we just pay our partners more  
**[0:16:16-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:16:16):**  that they will automatically plant more trees.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:16:18):**  You know, tree planting is something that normally at least takes a year of planning,  
**[0:16:25-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:16:25):**  because you need to work in the rainy season, you have to set up your nurseries and all  
**[0:16:29-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:16:29):**  that.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:16:30):**  It's not something that continues the whole year.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:16:31):**  So you need to make plans that are big enough to cover that year and then we pay them based  
**[0:16:36-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:16:36):**  on those plans.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:16:37):**  I'll make sure that the amount of trees that get planted with our partners and that we  
**[0:16:45-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:16:45):**  paid for is always a little bit higher than the amount of trees that we say on our websites  
**[0:16:52-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:16:52):**  that we've planted so far.  
**[0:16:53-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:16:53):**  So now our tree counter is around 75 million, but in reality we're a bit higher.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:17:01):**  And so how do those calculations work?  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:17:02):**  How do you figure out how many trees have especially survived after a certain period  
**[0:17:07-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:17:07):**  of time?  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:17:08):**  Because if I understand correctly, there's sort of a about a three year window in which  
**[0:17:13-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:17:13):**  many new trees fail.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:17:15):**  How is that sort of factored into the counter?  
**[0:17:17-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:17:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:17:18):**  So as I said, I make sure that the trees we've planted is always a little bit higher than  
**[0:17:25-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:17:25):**  the counter, but we also commit that we will follow every tree for at least three years.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:17:33):**  So in the industry, years is choosing because young trees are quite vulnerable, but if they  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:17:39):**  manage to get three years old, then they're normally also strong enough to grow 30 years  
**[0:17:43-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:17:43):**  old.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:17:45):**  You know, there's other factors that can avoid that from happening, but ecologically speaking,  
**[0:17:50-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:17:50):**  this tree has a good chance.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:17:51):**  And if in the social context in which it's planted, it survived the first three years,  
**[0:17:55-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:17:55):**  it has a good future.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:17:56):**  So we said we count a tree as a tree when it's three years old.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:18:00):**  So by doing field monitoring, verification or using satellite imagery or normally actually  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:18:07):**  a combination of those, we follow the trees for three years.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:18:11):**  And if we see that in a certain area, we are losing trees, then we deduct them again from  
**[0:18:16-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:18:16):**  our total count.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:18:19):**  But again, it's my task to make sure that the counter that is on the website is never  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:18:24):**  higher than the actual trees that are that are in the ground and that we are tracking  
**[0:18:29-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:18:29):**  over time.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:18:30):**  So it might be that one day we have 100 million trees planted, but because of some lack of  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:18:40):**  survival or fire or other things, we're losing 5 million.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:18:44):**  So then I correct our total tree count at 95 million.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:18:48):**  But at the website, the tree counter might only be at 85 million by that model.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:18:52):**  So I always make sure that we track a tree for three years.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:18:55):**  And if it dies, we correct for that.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:18:58):**  Yeah, that's quite thorough.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:19:01):**  So now let's talk about you've got, you said more than 25 projects all around the world.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:19:07):**  Where are these trees being planted and how does the organization choose sites for reforestation?  
**[0:19:18-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:19:18):**  Every organization has kind of its specialization in planting trees in the area in which they  
**[0:19:26-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:19:26):**  are located.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:19:27):**  So they all do it, I would say a little bit different, although there is some similarities.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:19:33):**  So typically trees get planted at private farmland.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:19:38):**  So we plant a lot of trees on private farmland.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:19:41):**  So farmers that, you know, want to do more agroforestry kind of systems very often there's  
**[0:19:45-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:19:45):**  also fruit trees, just very often what we talk about.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:19:49):**  Then there's often communal land that gets planted.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:19:52):**  So that's really village lands that, for example, has been used for grazing.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:19:58):**  But it's degraded.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:20:00):**  There's not much nutrients left.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:20:01):**  So it's not productive anymore.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:20:03):**  And the village wants to restore it.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:20:05):**  So communal land.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:20:07):**  And then there are sites that are more governmental sites.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:20:13):**  It can be even in national parks or just outside national parks, or for example, to restore  
**[0:20:19-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:20:19):**  watersheds.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:20:21):**  So areas that are very important to avoid erosion and runoff of water.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:20:28):**  Too much water in the rivers.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:20:30):**  It's all flowing away during a couple of weeks.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:20:33):**  Now actually restoring kind of the mountain slopes will avoid this runoff.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:20:38):**  So these are typically the kind of locations where the trees get planted.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:20:44):**  Where they get planted depends on whether a community is interested in having those  
**[0:20:49-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:20:49):**  trees.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:20:50):**  Because it obviously doesn't buy land and then puts trees there.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:20:54):**  We are only interested in finding communities that are interested to plant trees with us.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:21:00):**  Also because, of course, that's much better for the survival of the trees.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:21:03):**  Now you want people that want trees.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:21:04):**  And then you can work with them.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:21:07):**  So our local partners, they know.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:21:11):**  They constantly go out in the fields.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:21:14):**  And either they are called by villages that have heard of the programs or they proactively  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:21:19):**  during a community meeting of the village, they go there and explain about our program.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:21:25):**  And then together with the village, they make a plan.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:21:29):**  Where will they be planted?  
**[0:21:32-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:21:32):**  How many trees are actually needed?  
**[0:21:34-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:21:34):**  How many nurseries do we maybe need to establish?  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:21:37):**  Are there farmers that are interested in having trees that are private lands, etc.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:21:41):**  So then it's their task to kind of make an inventory of all of that.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:21:47):**  And they put that together.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:21:48):**  And that is kind of the figure that they are putting in the planning with Ecosia.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:21:53):**  So they know at the beginning of the year, we will probably work with, I don't know,  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:21:57):**  five villages every month during the socialization phase.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:22:01):**  Every village has its number of households and so many hectares of communal lands.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:22:05):**  So they know kind of what they can do based on the experiences they have.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:22:10):**  I love that approach.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:22:11):**  I'm really glad that such a large organization is working so directly with communities and  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:22:15):**  the people affected to get these projects going.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:22:19):**  Not just from sort of a top-down model, but one that really utilizes the human resources  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:22:24):**  on site and works with people who are already trying to regenerate the landscapes where  
**[0:22:30-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:22:30):**  they live.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:22:31):**  Now I know there are some difficulties kind of associated with that.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:22:35):**  And some of these are not that easy to address.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:22:39):**  Like many reforestation projects, especially around the world, that follow this kind of  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:22:43):**  top-down model that I mentioned, are deceptive in that they're planting monocultures of often  
**[0:22:48-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:22:48):**  non-native species that will either all be cut down again when they get to a certain  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:22:55):**  size and can even have devastating effects on the ecology despite this kind of umbrella  
**[0:23:00-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:23:00):**  term of reforestation.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:23:03):**  And sometimes leaving them kind of worse off and the land will slowly, worse off than leaving  
**[0:23:09-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:23:09):**  the land on its own to slowly regenerate.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:23:11):**  So how is Ecosia addressing the need for broader biodiversity and proliferation of native species?  
**[0:23:19-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:23:19):**  Well, it's very simply, this is what we call reforestation.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:23:25):**  So for me, planting monocultures of eucalyptus or monocultures of pine trees has nothing  
**[0:23:30-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:23:30):**  to do with reforestation.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:23:32):**  These are tree plantations.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:23:34):**  I think even tree plantations in particular actually when they serve smallholders can  
**[0:23:42-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:23:42):**  have their role.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:23:43):**  I have to be very careful here because I'm really not pointing at the large kind of more  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:23:49):**  than a couple of hectares monoculture sites.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:23:55):**  But overall, Ecosia simply doesn't allow it in its programs.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:24:00):**  So if someone comes with that proposal, and I had that a number of times where they want  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:24:04):**  to plant eucalyptus and pine trees, we simply reject it.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:24:08):**  We want our partners to plant native tree species from the region.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:24:14):**  We allow for 10% exotics.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:24:17):**  And the 10% exotics are normally the smallholder woodlots that I just talked about or fruit  
**[0:24:23-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:24:23):**  trees in agroforestry systems.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:24:25):**  But the majority has to be native and from the region.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:24:29):**  And this is a knockout criterion for us.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:24:32):**  So again, I had proposals where people wanted to do different and we didn't accept it.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:24:38):**  We have a project, this is actually in Peru.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:24:41):**  They work in the high Andes and they found it very difficult in their first year to get  
**[0:24:47-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:24:47):**  exactly to this 90% target because the communities there were used to planting pines.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:24:55):**  That's the only thing they had in the nursery.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:24:57):**  So there we allowed to kind of over the period of three years work towards 90% from 70%.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:25:03):**  But it's the only exception I can think of.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:25:06):**  So for the rest, we want native trees to be planted.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:25:11):**  And this is also what is needed.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:25:15):**  I think these are the most unlucky of all the trees in the world.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:25:26):**  They get cut down every day at an enormous rate because their timber is valuable or because  
**[0:25:32-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:25:32):**  they apparently stand in the way for soy or palm oil plantations.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:25:39):**  And also no one is actually, there's not many organizations having them in their nurseries  
**[0:25:42-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:25:42):**  because they don't have very much of commercial value.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:25:45):**  Yet for the local ecosystem, they are just the skeleton.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:25:51):**  Trees are the most diverse, most of the biodiversity on the planet lives in forests.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:25:58):**  And trees play a very important role in that.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:26:01):**  Yet we're turning them at an enormous rate and no one has the expertise on how to grow  
**[0:26:04-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:26:04):**  them back.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:26:06):**  So I really want Ecosia to be leading in this.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:26:09):**  And we have, and our project in Brazil, in the Mata Atlantica, is one of the biggest  
**[0:26:15-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:26:15):**  contributors to this.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:26:16):**  We are planting, I think by now, over 500 native tree species all over the world.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:26:23):**  And that's a principle point that we want.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:26:28):**  We want our money to be used for this kind of things.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:26:30):**  And if people don't want this, fair enough, then we go somewhere else.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:26:34):**  But there's also something about actually getting the capacity to understand how we  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:26:39):**  can restore some of these ecosystems that we have been destroying.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:26:44):**  There's not much people who know that.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:26:45):**  And it takes time to understand how you do it.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:26:49):**  For me, planting monoculture eucalyptus in pine is a whole different game.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:26:54):**  Really the only thing these systems have in common is the fact that both are tree-based.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:26:59):**  But for me, a monoculture plantation is nothing more than an agro-cultural land with corn.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:27:08):**  It's a monoculture crop used for human production.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:27:12):**  And it's not the future.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:27:16):**  It doesn't make sense.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:27:17):**  They destroy soils.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:27:18):**  They use too much water.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:27:21):**  And we even have now the problem that most of the expertise when it comes to tree planting  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:27:27):**  in this world is for this kind of systems.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:27:32):**  So many of the international pledges that there are about restoration are actually thinking  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:27:38):**  about more plantations of pine eucalyptus.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:27:42):**  That has nothing to do with reforestation.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:27:45):**  So we are very principled about this.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:27:48):**  We also want to explore better ways how native tree species can be used.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:27:52):**  But there's also we need a lot of more capacity in this world on how to restore them.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:27:58):**  And yeah, it's more difficult.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:28:03):**  It means that everywhere you work, whether it's in the Matadlantica, whether it is in  
**[0:28:07-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:28:07):**  Burkina Faso, whether it's in Madagascar, whether it's in Indonesia, you have to do  
**[0:28:11-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:28:11):**  with different tree species that need different treatment to grow.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:28:15):**  There's no one size fits all.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:28:17):**  So you need local partners that understand that.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:28:20):**  And they have to tell the younger guy in the nursery how to do it.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:28:22):**  And they have to tell the other guy how to do it.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:28:25):**  But this way, we are helping to build up this capacity, which we're going to need very soon  
**[0:28:30-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:28:30):**  on a very large scale.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:28:31):**  As you can see, you know, everyone wants to plant trees today.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:28:36):**  There's hardly anyone really knowing what he's talking about.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:28:39):**  And if we really become serious about these things, we're really going to need people  
**[0:28:43-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:28:43):**  that can do this native restoration at large scale.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:28:48):**  And then I mean, with many, many smallholders involved, thinking smartly about where in  
**[0:28:54-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:28:54):**  the landscape we need to move forest back to create corridors.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:28:57):**  And how can I breed my 25 native species in the nursery?  
**[0:29:02-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:29:02):**  That's remarkable.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:29:03):**  And I'm really glad that such a large organization has this attitude towards reforestation because  
**[0:29:07-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:29:07):**  I've been doing research on this topic for quite a while now.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:29:10):**  And like you said, it's hard to find reforestation efforts that don't approach it from a monoculture  
**[0:29:16-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:29:16):**  plantation point of view.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:29:18):**  And with that in mind, what is the criteria then for selecting tree species to plant in  
**[0:29:23-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:29:23):**  each different region?  
**[0:29:24-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:29:24):**  Because obviously, each one performs differently.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:29:27):**  The native species of each region are different.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:29:30):**  How do you go about selecting those?  
**[0:29:33-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:29:33):**  But we don't really select them.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:29:35):**  Our local partners select them.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:29:36):**  They have the ones who have that know how.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:29:39):**  So in every contract that we make, they include a list of the species that they want to plant.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:29:44):**  I of course tell them upfront, or if we get to a point where we're making a contract that  
**[0:29:49-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:29:49):**  we already agreed it will be native, but I still check it and to see, because sometimes  
**[0:29:53-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:29:53):**  they say, yes, it's native because it's adapted.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:29:57):**  I'm like, that's not really the same.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:30:00):**  So we go through the list that they want to plant, but I mean, they are free in setting  
**[0:30:04-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:30:04):**  up that list.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:30:05):**  And we select our partners and the fact that they have been working in the region before,  
**[0:30:10-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:30:10):**  have been doing successful restoration, often much smaller than what the closure eventually  
**[0:30:14-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:30:14):**  needs, but at least they have to have a tripod.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:30:17):**  So they know which species they use.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:30:19):**  They know how to grow them in the nursery.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:30:20):**  They know where the mother trees are that can provide the seeds, all these things.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:30:24):**  And we check that.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:30:26):**  And I'm now working on a big database in which we have all our tree species.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:30:33):**  So you can have further storage around them and you can actually see where we planted  
**[0:30:38-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:30:38):**  which species.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:30:39):**  Things like this take a bit of time, but this is what we're doing on our end.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:30:44):**  And really, if you think about it, we work in biodiversity hotspots.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:30:50):**  So this is quite important.  
**[0:30:52-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:30:52):**  Biodiversity hotspot is a definition of an area that has over 1,500 endemic species.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:31:00):**  So birds, animals, plants that only live there, but of which 70% is already gone and the remaining  
**[0:31:08-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:31:08):**  30% is under high pressure.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:31:10):**  That's the definition of a biodiversity hotspot.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:31:12):**  It's pretty awful.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:31:15):**  And why was this concept developed?  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:31:16):**  It's because conservation money, you need to priorities certain areas over others.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:31:21):**  This was the original thinking about the creation of the so-called biodiversity hotspots.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:31:26):**  So we use this as a compass, like where can E. colii's money have the biggest impact?  
**[0:31:31-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:31:31):**  Because if we can restore some hectares of Madagascar, it means we are really saving  
**[0:31:37-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:31:37):**  some species from extinction.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:31:40):**  And to me, that's a better spend of our money than planting another hectare, for example,  
**[0:31:46-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:31:46):**  in Canada or Russia.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:31:48):**  So from a biodiversity perspective, that is really what I want to go to those places.  
**[0:31:53-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:31:53):**  It also means we're directly supporting capacity building around these species in the region.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:32:03):**  Because the easy way how it starts is that you look around in the native trees, the native  
**[0:32:09-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:32:09):**  forest patches that are still there, and you collect the seeds from these trees and you're  
**[0:32:12-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:32:12):**  going to try how they do in the nursery.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:32:15):**  People very often know which one are more the primary species, which one are more the  
**[0:32:18-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:32:18):**  climax species, so they don't know how it's there.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:32:20):**  And then you see over time, they start experimenting with new species.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:32:23):**  This is kind of the logical excitement that comes in these groups to start to try new  
**[0:32:28-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:32:28):**  things.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:32:29):**  And this is, I've seen a nursery in Brazil run by Copaiba, a women group that I think  
**[0:32:36-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:32:36):**  was growing over 200 or 300 species in a single nursery.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:32:44):**  What that means, it means that in the brains of these women, there is how you can save  
**[0:32:50-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:32:50):**  this forest or how you can regrow this forest with all its biodiversity.  
**[0:32:56-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:32:56):**  That's where I stand up for every morning.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:32:58):**  Yeah, that's remarkable.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:33:00):**  And so, I mean, this program has been established for a bit of time.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:33:05):**  What effects have you seen in some of these projects over the time since they've been  
**[0:33:09-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:33:09):**  established as the new forests start to become kind of more stable and have an impact on  
**[0:33:16-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:33:16):**  the local ecosystem?  
**[0:33:18-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:33:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:33:19):**  And one word of caution, many of our projects were started after I joined the COSA three  
**[0:33:27-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:33:27):**  years ago.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:33:28):**  So we have signed, of the 25 projects, we have signed 20 projects in the past two years.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:33:35):**  So these trees are growing, visit them frequently or my colleagues, but you can't expect that  
**[0:33:43-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:33:43):**  they already have a big impact on the natural ecosystem.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:33:48):**  For the older trees, we see very clear things.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:33:52):**  So let me give you just three examples.  
**[0:33:53-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:33:53):**  The one is on Madagascar, where we are planting mangrove trees to protect the coast.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:34:01):**  Mangroves are great.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:34:02):**  They also store a lot of carbon and they're kind of the nurseries for many fish species.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:34:07):**  If you look at a map of that region, you can really see an increase in forest cover from  
**[0:34:15-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:34:15):**  2015 on.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:34:17):**  So literally, use Google Maps, zoom into the area and you see that the forest cover is  
**[0:34:22-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:34:22):**  increasing.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:34:23):**  And also if you look at it a bit more technologically, you can with satellites look at the rate,  
**[0:34:31-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:34:31):**  the difference between the absorption of light over time.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:34:35):**  And of course, if there's more leaves, more light will be absorbed.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:34:38):**  This is a very layman's way of explaining it, but this is what we do.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:34:43):**  You can see that over time, the absorption of light is getting higher at these sites.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:34:47):**  And it means that there is more leaves, there's more chlorophyll and the site gets greener.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:34:53):**  So this is an area where you can actually see that as well in the satellite imagery  
**[0:34:58-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:34:58):**  because it's available as well as with the more technical approach.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:35:02):**  So that's cool.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:35:04):**  Tree density is coming back there and it's increasing over time.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:35:08):**  So that's exactly what we're here for.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:35:11):**  And again, the youngest trees there are now maybe four years old, but already it has a  
**[0:35:16-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:35:16):**  measurable impact.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:35:20):**  Another project where I was recently super excited is Indonesia.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:35:25):**  The wet tropics, I mean, this is of course the ideal place to grow trees because it's  
**[0:35:31-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:35:31):**  hot and wet there.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:35:33):**  So that means trees love to grow.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:35:35):**  But we have a system there where farmers that are the classical way of doing agriculture  
**[0:35:46-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:35:46):**  on Borneo by the diet people is to use a forest.  
**[0:35:54-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:35:54):**  Then they will do some cereal there for a couple of years.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:36:00):**  And then if the soil is not productive anymore, they put rubber trees on it or they just leave  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:36:04):**  the site alone and they go and burn the next plot of forest.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:36:08):**  This is not a very sustainable system.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:36:11):**  At the other hand, this is something they've been doing for centuries.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:36:14):**  So we should maybe also respect a little bit their traditional way of living in that regard.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:36:19):**  Now what we do there is that we say, OK, how about instead of just leaving the site alone,  
**[0:36:26-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:36:26):**  you now actively plant fruit trees there.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:36:29):**  And for every fruit tree that you plant, we will give you a way more productive rubber  
**[0:36:35-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:36:35):**  tree that also lives much longer.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:36:37):**  Of course, the secret plan here is that we are instead of these areas growing into kind  
**[0:36:43-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:36:43):**  of shrubs and wheat areas, this is really how they see it, it looks like a forest for  
**[0:36:48-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:36:48):**  them, it's just an area of wheat.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:36:50):**  It grows into an orchard.  
**[0:36:55-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:36:55):**  And I've been there and it's working.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:36:57):**  You see people now harvesting the first fruits from the trees there and they grow so incredibly  
**[0:37:02-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:37:02):**  fast.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:37:03):**  I've been there on bare land where I started the program when I was there two and a half  
**[0:37:08-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:37:08):**  years ago and now two and a half years later, I was surrounded by trees.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:37:13):**  We were walking into a forest because the guy wanted to show his plot to the farmer  
**[0:37:19-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:37:19):**  and on a certain moment he stopped and he said, we're there.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:37:22):**  I was like, what do you mean we're there?  
**[0:37:24-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:37:24):**  He said, we're there.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:37:25):**  We're in the middle of the forest, we're surrounded by trees, we're there.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:37:28):**  And this was the same spot where I was a couple of years earlier and I was not.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:37:33):**  So this is very real.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:37:36):**  I can't get it more real.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:37:38):**  What is, I mean, you could let me be a bit of devil's advocate to myself.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:37:41):**  What is now the impact of this on the local biodiversity?  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:37:44):**  What is now the impact of this on the social, the local economy?  
**[0:37:48-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:37:48):**  What is the impact on this on the water cycles, etc?  
**[0:37:53-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:37:53):**  That's still very moderate.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:37:54):**  We would be the last one, as it goes out, to say that we are solving all the problems  
**[0:37:59-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:37:59):**  in the region there.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:38:01):**  Our trees in particular, where they are there to protect against erosion or to avoid too  
**[0:38:07-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:38:07):**  much runoff.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:38:08):**  This is happening and it is regreening the area.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:38:11):**  Burkina Faso, we're restoring desert, deserted lands back into tree systems, into savannah  
**[0:38:17-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:38:17):**  forest.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:38:18):**  And this is only possible if you catch the water that is falling there once a year, but  
**[0:38:23-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:38:23):**  you actually are able to keep it instead of letting it run off.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:38:26):**  And that's what we do there.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:38:27):**  We make holes in which we put seeds and then the trees just grow.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:38:30):**  So this effect there is really, really significant.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:38:36):**  Do we measure all the different impacts?  
**[0:38:38-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:38:38):**  Now, we started doing that a little bit, also on the social level, like how many people  
**[0:38:42-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:38:42):**  are working for us.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:38:43):**  There's still a lot more we can do there.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:38:46):**  But we are bringing native trees, native forests back on the planet.  
**[0:38:53-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:38:53):**  That is a claim I will be able to carry with me the rest of my life.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:39:00):**  I like that you mentioned the social aspect there.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:39:02):**  It is a big part of the impact that is built into the process here and why that you work  
**[0:39:09-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:39:09):**  directly with organizations in these specific places.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:39:13):**  Because obviously planting a forest is an essential step forward, but how are you working  
**[0:39:18-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:39:18):**  with the communities themselves in the affected areas to make sure that the forests are actually  
**[0:39:21-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:39:21):**  valued and not just cut down again as soon as the project potentially wraps up?  
**[0:39:27-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:39:27):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:39:29):**  This I think is the more, almost more interesting dimension of our work.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:39:35):**  Because obviously, if you're working in areas that are heavily deforested, why wouldn't  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:39:41):**  the new trees that you plant there face kind of the same future as the trees that used  
**[0:39:45-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:39:45):**  to be there?  
**[0:39:48-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:39:48):**  And I think there's a couple of reasons for that.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:39:50):**  The one is that also in the global south, people have realized that their practices  
**[0:39:59-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:39:59):**  of the past decades were not sustainable.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:40:03):**  That is why we now have communities coming to us asking for trees.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:40:07):**  They see that all their topsoil has just been running into the river.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:40:13):**  The river is nothing more than a basin full of topsoil now, and most of it is flushing  
**[0:40:17-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:40:17):**  towards the sea.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:40:19):**  So they're losing their topsoil.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:40:20):**  And this is, for example, in Ghana, I could see this very clearly.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:40:24):**  In Burkina Faso, they know that overgrazing and using the wood for firewood has degraded  
**[0:40:31-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:40:31):**  the landscape and has increased the hectares of desert that they have in their country.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:40:37):**  So people there, and I see the same in Ethiopia, I see the same in Peru, they are aware that  
**[0:40:44-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:40:44):**  getting all the trees kind of antlers on their land wasn't really a good idea.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:40:48):**  Not everywhere, but in the place where we work, there is that sentiment coming.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:40:53):**  So that is a reason why they are also more sensible, I guess, for starting to work with  
**[0:40:57-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:40:57):**  us.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:40:58):**  The other thing is that it's really important to design the right social incentives in your  
**[0:41:07-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:41:07):**  program.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:41:09):**  And what I mean with that is that, sorry, I found this term.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:41:16):**  What is really important is to build the right social incentives in your program.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:41:20):**  And what I mean with that is that you kind of understand how the people will react to  
**[0:41:25-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:41:25):**  certain trees.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:41:27):**  So a very easy way of looking at it is if you work with farmers and they have to plant  
**[0:41:32-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:41:32):**  trees on their land, you want to make sure these are trees that have a direct benefit  
**[0:41:36-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:41:36):**  for them.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:41:37):**  For example, because of the fruits or because of the raisin or because of the nuts that  
**[0:41:41-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:41:41):**  come out of them, or they can use the branches for firewood.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:41:45):**  So this is the thing you want to make sure, because then the farmer has to take care of  
**[0:41:48-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:41:48):**  the trees.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:41:50):**  By the way, I also think that that is a reason why the farmer should actually pay a little  
**[0:41:54-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:41:54):**  bit for his trees.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:41:56):**  Even if it's just a very symbolic price, if you get something for free, it doesn't have  
**[0:42:04-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:42:04):**  value.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:42:05):**  So if you pay a symbolic price for it, it is something that you paid for.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:42:09):**  And I feel you will even take better care of it.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:42:11):**  But this is just a little cycle.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:42:14):**  For the larger areas, you also have to treat it not like we're going to plant trees here  
**[0:42:21-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:42:21):**  and please be happy.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:42:23):**  You have to treat it as a partnership between you and the village.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:42:27):**  There is a problem, not enough trees, and we can solve it together.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:42:31):**  But we as Ecosia can bring the financial means, for example, to set up a nursery.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:42:37):**  But they really have to make clear agreements on how they will deal with the future new  
**[0:42:41-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:42:41):**  restored site.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:42:43):**  And if they're not willing to make those agreements, then it's not yet the right time to start  
**[0:42:47-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:42:47):**  working with them.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:42:49):**  And I'm not saying this is going perfectly everywhere.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:42:52):**  But in most of our projects, there's very clear agreements within the community on how  
**[0:42:57-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:42:57):**  they treat the new land.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:42:59):**  And that means no grazing.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:43:02):**  That means a caretaking committee.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:43:05):**  It very often also means that Ecosia pays for the nursery, but the community makes the  
**[0:43:11-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:43:11):**  labor available to get the trees in the ground and to do the earth work.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:43:15):**  So that's a partnership where we're both benefiting from.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:43:19):**  And this social incentives and the way how we frame that also towards the village.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:43:25):**  And I'm learning a lot from all my projects here.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:43:27):**  And I'm teaching new projects on this because it's vital.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:43:33):**  It's basically working on changing mindsets.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:43:37):**  And this is the thing that we have to understand to bring trees back.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:43:42):**  Someone said, you know, if you have a globe and you spin it and you randomly put your  
**[0:43:47-0:43:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:43:47):**  finger somewhere, you can probably plant a tree there.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:43:50):**  And I think that's probably true.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:43:52):**  But if you spin a globe and you randomly put your finger there, there's also someone who  
**[0:43:57-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:43:57):**  is using this land.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:43:59):**  Even if it's very extensively, someone will be there with his goats every now and then  
**[0:44:03-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:44:03):**  or with his cow to use that land.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:44:06):**  So that means that every reforestation project is also a social economic project.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:44:12):**  And you have to understand this dimension very much.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:44:15):**  Unless you better don't start to work because it's not just a technical challenge.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:44:20):**  And so I'm again, we're not perfect in everything, but we're very aware of this and we're more  
**[0:44:26-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:44:26):**  and more including this in when we make a project design together with our partners.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:44:35):**  And another aspect that I learned from doing research on the website there is that you  
**[0:44:39-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:44:39):**  work with a lot of sort of unexpected ways of growing trees that don't actually involve  
**[0:44:44-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:44:44):**  planting them directly.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:44:45):**  Can you talk about some of the firefighting efforts in Brazil and some of the organizations  
**[0:44:51-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:44:51):**  that you support that are helping forests to grow naturally?  
**[0:44:55-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:44:55):**  Yeah, no, I mean, ecologically, planting a tree is often actually the worst way to get  
**[0:45:03-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:45:03):**  a tree back.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:45:04):**  Because you have to kind of nurture the nursery and that means very often people have to buy  
**[0:45:12-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:45:12):**  the plastic bags which you put it in and it has to be prepared and has to be taken care  
**[0:45:16-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:45:16):**  of.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:45:17):**  And then you take this very fragile little tree out of the nursery and put it somewhere  
**[0:45:20-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:45:20):**  in the harsh world, it's going to survive.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:45:22):**  So it's probably going to die.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:45:25):**  It's really, if you look at it purely from an efficiency perspective, it's really not  
**[0:45:30-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:45:30):**  the best way to bring trees back.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:45:32):**  Whereas in most of the places in particular where we work, if you would just put a fence  
**[0:45:36-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:45:36):**  around it, trees would already grow back.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:45:39):**  Because it's not that there are no trees there because people didn't plant them yet, there's  
**[0:45:43-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:45:43):**  no trees there because people are using the land.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:45:46):**  There is cases where even if you don't use the land, trees don't grow back.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:45:50):**  This is very much true, for example, for our sites in Burkina Faso, there is eroded sites  
**[0:45:55-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:45:55):**  in Ethiopia and Peru, where this is also the case.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:46:01):**  But very often, trees will grow there if you just leave it alone.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:46:04):**  My favorite example is if you ever travel through Germany or France by train, there's  
**[0:46:09-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:46:09):**  all these abundant railway stations, the ones that were very active in the 70s and are not  
**[0:46:16-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:46:16):**  active anymore.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:46:18):**  And many of them are overgrown with trees now because no one entered the site.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:46:25):**  And so what happens is that trees start to grow.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:46:28):**  And this is the case in many places in the world.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:46:31):**  Now therefore, at the KOSIA we say, we are the search engine that plants trees, but really  
**[0:46:37-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:46:37):**  we want to be the growth trees.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:46:39):**  And if we find more effect, it's to grow trees back.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:46:42):**  We're absolutely interested in exploring.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:46:45):**  The world, however, is more looking into, you know, trees, you know, you want to plant  
**[0:46:50-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:46:50):**  them, but we say no, they're automatic.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:46:52):**  So a relatively famous one is farmer managed natural use.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:46:57):**  And this means that many farmers on their land actually have stumps, they're still growing.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:47:04):**  And every time the animals eat a stump, these trees never get into full trees.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:47:10):**  However, if you manage that stump, it's basically cutting off the weakest stems and allowing  
**[0:47:21-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:47:21):**  the tree to give it energy to the one or two biggest that are stumped.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:47:27):**  Over time, a tree will go back and it will be very robust because it still has its roots  
**[0:47:32-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:47:32):**  system.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:47:33):**  And when the roots are there, you're just adding the tree to it.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:47:36):**  So farmer managed natural regeneration is how it's called or assisted natural regeneration.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:47:41):**  It's great way to grow trees.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:47:42):**  We also, in Brazil, we talked to a partner who said, you know, the biggest threat to  
**[0:47:47-0:47:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:47:47):**  our trees here is actually fires.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:47:49):**  You know, we all see that in the Amazon.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:47:51):**  Actually, it's illegal to put your land on fire to clean it from trees, but still many  
**[0:47:56-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:47:56):**  people do it.  
**[0:47:57-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:47:57):**  So we did two things there.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:48:00):**  We put on a lot of signs everywhere saying it's illegal to burn land for grazing when  
**[0:48:08-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:48:08):**  there's trees on it.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:48:10):**  So if you see this happening, please call this number.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:48:13):**  So this has two messages, one to the one who wants to do it.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:48:16):**  Second that if he does it, he probably has a problem.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:48:21):**  The other thing is we're supporting a team of firefighters that goes there in the dry  
**[0:48:25-0:48:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:48:25):**  season.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:48:26):**  When they receive a message about a fire starting somewhere, they go there and they fight the  
**[0:48:30-0:48:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:48:30):**  fire.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:48:31):**  And we expect that in the coming five to ten years, we will be able to grow back 25 million  
**[0:48:38-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:48:38):**  trees this way.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:48:39):**  But again, we don't want to bullshit about it.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:48:42):**  So we're clearly mapping which area has been burned and which area do we think we avoid  
**[0:48:47-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:48:47):**  the burn because of this.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:48:49):**  And we'll have to now track over time how this is developing.  
**[0:48:51-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:48:51):**  So this is it's a little bit out of the box way of doing it.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:48:56):**  A different way we do it in Malawi is we try to grow trees through a radio.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:49:00):**  So what we do there is that we say many farmers here are actually practicing farmer managed  
**[0:49:07-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:49:07):**  natural regeneration.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:49:08):**  So they're keeping trees in their land.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:49:10):**  But there's also many farmers who are not doing it.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:49:12):**  How can this be?  
**[0:49:13-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:49:13):**  The one farmer sees the benefit, the other doesn't.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:49:16):**  And we are hypothesis is that the farmers who don't do it, they are not convinced of  
**[0:49:21-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:49:21):**  the benefits of trees.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:49:22):**  So instead of teaching them about the benefits of trees, we thought why don't we make a radio  
**[0:49:28-0:49:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:49:28):**  show in which the farmers that have trees on their land explain to the world, the world  
**[0:49:35-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:49:35):**  in Malawi, why they're having the trees on their land, what benefits it has for them,  
**[0:49:39-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:49:39):**  and why they're maintaining these trees.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:49:42):**  And maybe that's a way to bring many trees back in the landscape.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:49:47):**  But again, Ecosia will only know if we do a baseline study.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:49:50):**  And after the radio programs, we check again, you know, have we seen any increase in tree  
**[0:49:55-0:49:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:49:55):**  cover?  
**[0:49:56-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:49:56):**  So that's what we did.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:49:57):**  We will never just do firefighting, we will never just do a radio program.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:50:00):**  We want to make sure that this is a way to grow trees back.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:50:03):**  So we measure a baseline, we do activity and we measure how things are going.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:50:07):**  And if this works, we have some super out of the box, very scalable because fires are  
**[0:50:13-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:50:13):**  everywhere in the world, and people listen to the radio everywhere in the world to increase  
**[0:50:17-0:50:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:50:17):**  our problems.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:50:18):**  This is remarkable.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:50:20):**  I really admire kind of the creativity of these approaches and seeing reforestation  
**[0:50:26-0:50:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:50:26):**  on many different levels from the social down to working directly on the ground and putting  
**[0:50:31-0:50:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:50:31):**  trees in the ground, and all of the different methods that can be utilized to help transform  
**[0:50:36-0:50:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:50:36):**  not just the thoughts and the education of the people involved with this, but actually  
**[0:50:41-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:50:41):**  the culture around it, that this spreads perhaps from generation to generation.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:50:46):**  And speaking of that, what are some of the overall goals of Ecosia for reforestation  
**[0:50:52-0:50:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:50:52):**  in the long term?  
**[0:50:53-0:50:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:50:53):**  Where would you like to be in say five or ten more years?  
**[0:50:58-0:51:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:50:58):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:51:02):**  I think there's two things.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:51:03):**  The one is that, as I said, we started our conversation with talking about the difference  
**[0:51:09-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:51:09):**  about native forest and monoculture eucalyptus or pine plantations.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:51:17):**  I think one of the problems we have is that indeed not every tree is a business case.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:51:24):**  So if it would obviously pay back to restore native forest, we wouldn't have a problem  
**[0:51:29-0:51:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:51:29):**  because everyone would be doing it.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:51:31):**  But it's not so obvious.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:51:33):**  But whereby for eucalyptus and pine, of course people don't pay for the bio-effects, but  
**[0:51:37-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:51:37):**  there's a business case.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:51:40):**  Now not every tree is a business case, but the world is getting smarter on how trees  
**[0:51:47-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:51:47):**  can be part of a productive, earning agro model, which you would then call an agroforestry  
**[0:51:55-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:51:55):**  model.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:51:56):**  Where instead of having one annual monoculture crop, you'll actually have annual plus perennial  
**[0:52:03-0:52:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:52:03):**  crops plus bushes plus shrubs on your land, all have products that you can harvest, different  
**[0:52:10-0:52:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:52:10):**  products, so diversification of your income stream, but you will be way more resistant  
**[0:52:15-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:52:15):**  against prices in the market and also against, for example, climate change.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:52:20):**  And I really believe that we will, I'm already seeing it, we are seeing an uptake of these  
**[0:52:25-0:52:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:52:25):**  models, not only in the developing world, but also in Western countries.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:52:30):**  More and more people are thinking, how can we bring trees back into our agricultural  
**[0:52:35-0:52:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:52:35):**  systems?  
**[0:52:36-0:52:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:52:36):**  And what would excite me, and we have done the first start here, is that Ecosia will  
**[0:52:40-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:52:40):**  show that these kind of restoration agriculture, where you bring soil back and where you bring  
**[0:52:48-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:52:48):**  trees back in the landscape, actually will be a business case as well.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:52:52):**  You just have to maybe a little bit more patient when you get your money back.  
**[0:52:55-0:53:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:52:55):**  You maybe have to accept a little bit of a lower return, but it can pay out.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:53:00):**  It's not something that needs extra cash every year.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:53:02):**  So we are showcasing now the first projects that are actually working that way.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:53:07):**  So in my view, in the next five years, we will not only be spending money on planting  
**[0:53:13-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:53:13):**  native forest back, but half of our money would actually be used to showcase restoration  
**[0:53:21-0:53:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:53:21):**  agriculture with tree systems.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:53:23):**  And that money we would earn back, and we would use again to either do the same thing  
**[0:53:27-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:53:27):**  or plant more native forest.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:53:28):**  So I want our portfolio to be kind of 50-50.  
**[0:53:32-0:53:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:53:32):**  And these two are super complementary.  
**[0:53:35-0:53:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:53:35):**  In a landscape, in an ideal situation, you have both restoration of the native forest,  
**[0:53:40-0:53:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:53:40):**  and as a buffer zone next to them, you have agroforestry systems that actually pay back  
**[0:53:43-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:53:43):**  themselves.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:53:44):**  This would be my absolute dream, and we make kind of productive and profitable landscapes.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:53:49):**  So this is the one vision I'm having.  
**[0:53:52-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:53:52):**  The other vision is that we really need a lot of trees to grow back.  
**[0:53:58-0:54:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:53:58):**  And the only way how we can do that is to build capacity in the world on how to do this.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:54:04):**  There's so many tree planting claims all over the world.  
**[0:54:07-0:54:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:54:07):**  And I'm not convinced that many of them have happened.  
**[0:54:12-0:54:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:54:12):**  And I'm absolutely not convinced that many of them that pledge that they want to do a  
**[0:54:17-0:54:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:54:17):**  lot will actually make it happen because they frankly have no idea what you're talking about.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:54:24):**  We've planted 70 million trees.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:54:26):**  It was not easy, and it is not easy to make the plans and the budget and everything for  
**[0:54:32-0:54:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:54:32):**  the next 100 million trees.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:54:33):**  We will get it.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:54:34):**  We will get it done, but it's not easy.  
**[0:54:36-0:54:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:54:36):**  So if someone's pledging that he's going to plant a billion or even a trillion trees,  
**[0:54:40-0:54:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:54:40):**  I think it's time to start telling him that the future of our planet is too serious to  
**[0:54:46-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:54:46):**  make jokes.  
**[0:54:49-0:54:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:54:49):**  So I'm inviting everyone to be very serious about planting trees, but we need them to  
**[0:54:55-0:54:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:54:55):**  be serious.  
**[0:54:56-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:54:56):**  And that includes, and this is basically the point I want to get to, is that you know where  
**[0:55:01-0:55:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:55:01):**  your trees are planted.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:55:02):**  So you have a map in which you can show here and here and here.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:55:06):**  And that you're also following up on them as per your COSIA method, I would say at least  
**[0:55:10-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:55:10):**  three years.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:55:11):**  So you're really working on impact and not just on putting some more roots in the soil.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:55:17):**  Sure.  
**[0:55:18-0:55:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:55:18):**  I'm adding the statistics in order to get sort of support either economically or for  
**[0:55:22-0:55:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:55:22):**  other social means.  
**[0:55:24-0:55:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:55:24):**  It seems like that's being leveraged a lot now to kind of pad people's, you could call  
**[0:55:28-0:55:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:55:28):**  it green credibility for their organizations or their businesses.  
**[0:55:32-0:55:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:55:32):**  And you see that a lot that, you know, how do you follow up if there's any meaning behind  
**[0:55:36-0:55:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:55:36):**  it perhaps?  
**[0:55:37-0:55:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:55:37):**  Yeah, no, no.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:55:38):**  So I think in the tree planting sector, it should be the default or the natural reflex  
**[0:55:44-0:55:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:55:44):**  to say, okay, can I have a map of where my trees are?  
**[0:55:48-0:55:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:55:48):**  Can I have geotechnical pictures of my trees or of the tree plant itself?  
**[0:55:53-0:55:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:55:53):**  Can I have a list of which pieces are planted there?  
**[0:55:56-0:56:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:55:56):**  And I'm going to follow up on that for three years.  
**[0:56:00-0:56:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:56:00):**  And this is really the kind of next step this sector has to make because everything else  
**[0:56:06-0:56:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:56:06):**  will just lead to more talking.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:56:10):**  But, you know, the actual action on the ground not catching up with that.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:56:15):**  And that's a big problem.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:56:18):**  People that depend on, you know, their landscapes being restored.  
**[0:56:23-0:56:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:56:23):**  I love that.  
**[0:56:24-0:56:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:56:24):**  I like the ambition behind that, but also the pragmatism and realizing kind of where  
**[0:56:29-0:56:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:56:29):**  you haven't gotten to yet and really kind of working a strategy in there within kind  
**[0:56:34-0:56:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:56:34):**  of an admission of what needs to get done to achieve it.  
**[0:56:39-0:56:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:56:39):**  And with that in mind, how can people at home participate and support these replanting efforts?  
**[0:56:46-0:56:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:56:46):**  I think the big impact that they can have is maybe not what they think directly.  
**[0:56:54-0:57:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:56:54):**  The big impact that it can have is, first of all, use Ecosia as your search engine.  
**[0:57:01-0:57:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:57:01):**  The more people we have, the more value we have to advertisers and the more money we'll  
**[0:57:05-0:57:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:57:05):**  get.  
**[0:57:06-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:57:06):**  That's a very simple way to have a very big impact.  
**[0:57:10-0:57:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:57:10):**  The second thing that you do is to set all to be very critical when people are making  
**[0:57:20-0:57:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:57:20):**  that sound too good to be.  
**[0:57:23-0:57:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:57:23):**  And having said that, I realize Ecosia makes maybe even a claim that's too good to be true  
**[0:57:28-0:57:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:57:28):**  saying that we've planted 70 million trees.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:57:30):**  But OK, ask me anything you want.  
**[0:57:32-0:57:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:57:32):**  Ask me to show where they are.  
**[0:57:35-0:57:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:57:35):**  Ask me how we work with everyone.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:57:36):**  I can give you the answers.  
**[0:57:38-0:57:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:57:38):**  And I'm convinced I can convince you.  
**[0:57:40-0:57:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:57:40):**  But if someone makes pledges about what they're going to do or what I want to do in the future  
**[0:57:45-0:57:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:57:45):**  or what I have been doing, ask the question.  
**[0:57:48-0:57:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:57:48):**  Show me the map.  
**[0:57:49-0:57:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:57:49):**  Show me geotech pictures.  
**[0:57:51-0:57:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:57:51):**  And show me how they're doing after three years.  
**[0:57:54-0:57:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:57:54):**  Because then you're really helping to professionalize this section.  
**[0:57:58-0:58:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:57:58):**  The first thing you can do is to do your own action.  
**[0:58:04-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:58:04):**  Direct organizations that do tree planting actions to see how you can support them.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:58:11):**  Buy products in your supermarkets that depend on trees.  
**[0:58:16-0:58:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:58:16):**  Eat more almonds.  
**[0:58:18-0:58:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:58:18):**  Eat more nuts.  
**[0:58:19-0:58:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:58:19):**  And try to think about, even for flour, you can make flour out of chestnuts.  
**[0:58:28-0:58:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:58:28):**  Which is wonderful.  
**[0:58:29-0:58:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:58:29):**  Which is a wonderful flour.  
**[0:58:32-0:58:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:58:32):**  If you mix 25% chestnut flour into the cake you're making, you're directly stimulating  
**[0:58:39-0:58:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:58:39):**  more chestnut trees.  
**[0:58:41-0:58:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:58:41):**  So there's all these things you can do that your purchasing decision will actually destroy  
**[0:58:47-0:58:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:58:47):**  a forest or regrow a forest.  
**[0:58:51-0:58:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:58:51):**  I know that not every chestnut tree comes from a forest.  
**[0:58:54-0:58:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:58:54):**  But it's the beginning.  
**[0:58:55-0:58:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:58:55):**  And the same with where you're flying.  
**[0:58:56-0:58:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:58:56):**  Are you going to take the plane or take the train.  
**[0:58:59-0:59:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:58:59):**  There's these things that we simply all have to do.  
**[0:59:03-0:59:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:59:03):**  And it should be the default way of looking at things.  
**[0:59:06-0:59:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:59:06):**  Another kind of rejoice that actually hurts.  
**[0:59:11-0:59:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:59:11):**  For sure.  
**[0:59:12-0:59:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:59:12):**  Now Peter, I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today.  
**[0:59:15-0:59:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:59:15):**  I have been using Ecosia as a search engine for a couple of years now.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:59:19):**  And it's great to hear a first-hand account of how these projects and where that minor  
**[0:59:24-0:59:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:59:24):**  contribution is actually working behind a groundswell that's getting real work done  
**[0:59:30-0:59:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:59:30):**  all around the world.  
**[0:59:31-0:59:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:59:31):**  Especially in these zones of threatened biodiversity.  
**[0:59:35-0:59:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:59:35):**  Which I'm increasingly concerned about.  
**[0:59:38-0:59:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:59:38):**  Just so much of the research that I've done through this series here on reforestation  
**[0:59:42-0:59:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:59:42):**  has reconfirmed for me the importance of this type of work.  
**[0:59:46-0:59:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:59:46):**  And it's a real pleasure speaking to you.  
**[0:59:48-0:59:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:59:48):**  So I wish you the best in all these projects.  
**[0:59:51-0:59:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:59:51):**  Perhaps we can do a follow-up again in a couple of years and see how these continue to grow.  
**[0:59:55-0:59:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:59:55):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:59:56-0:59:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:59:56):**  It would be my pleasure.  
**[0:59:58-1:00:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=0:59:58):**  That would be a very sustainable way of looking at it.  
**[1:00:00-1:00:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=1:00:00):**  So let's do that.  
**[1:00:01-1:00:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=1:00:01):**  Marvelous.  
**[1:00:02-1:00:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=1:00:02):**  All right, I'll talk to you again soon.  
**[1:00:03-1:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=1:00:03):**  You take care.  
**[1:00:05-1:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=1:00:05):**  Thank you Oliver.  
**[1:00:08-1:00:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=1:00:08):**  All right, that wraps things up for this week's episode.  
**[1:00:11-1:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=1:00:11):**  If you enjoyed this interview and want to find more like it, as well as articles and  
**[1:00:14-1:00:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=1:00:14):**  other resources, you can find the full library of previous podcasts at abundantedge.com.  
**[1:00:20-1:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=1:00:20):**  The best part is that you can search by topic rather than wading through more than 100 interviews  
**[1:00:25-1:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=1:00:25):**  by typing in any keyword or topic that you're looking for in the search function on the  
**[1:00:29-1:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=1:00:29):**  podcast page.  
**[1:00:30-1:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=1:00:30):**  I've spoken to experts on everything from growing your own food, building homes from  
**[1:00:34-1:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=1:00:34):**  natural materials, to beekeeping, vermicompost, permaculture design, philosophy, and so much  
**[1:00:40-1:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=1:00:40):**  more.  
**[1:00:41-1:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=1:00:41):**  Thank you so much to those of you who've taken the time to reach out via comments and emails.  
**[1:00:46-1:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=1:00:46):**  Your contributions helped me to make this the conversation that it's intended to be  
**[1:00:50-1:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=1:00:50):**  and helps me create more of the content around the topics that you're interested in.  
**[1:00:54-1:00:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=1:00:54):**  If you have any insights, advice, questions, or suggestions, be sure to send them to me  
**[1:00:58-1:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=1:00:58):**  at info at abundantedge.com and I'll look forward to being in touch.  
**[1:01:03-1:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pieter-van-midwoud/#t=1:01:03):**  New episodes come out every Friday like clockwork, so I'll catch you on next week's show.

**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:01:26):**  Alright welcome to another episode of The Abundant Edge podcast.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:01:30):**  This is honestly one of my favorite interviews that I've yet done and I'll tell you why.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:01:34):**  In this interview I got to talk to one of my heroes in the regenerative farming world,  
**[0:01:38-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:01:38):**  Richard Perkins.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:01:39):**  Now many of you probably already know Richard and Ridge Dale Farm from all of the amazingly  
**[0:01:44-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:01:44):**  informative videos and seminars that he's put out on YouTube.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:01:47):**  I personally came across Richard about 8 months ago and nearly been watched all of his material  
**[0:01:52-0:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:01:52):**  online right there and then.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:01:54):**  In just a few short seasons, Richard and a small team have taken a severely degraded  
**[0:01:58-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:01:58):**  small farm in northern Sweden, which is about 59 degrees north, which is around Alaskan  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:02:05):**  latitudes for those of you who need reference in the States.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:02:09):**  They've taken the site from a mediocre monocrop production into a profitable, diverse, and  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:02:13):**  regenerative permaculture site that produces veggies, eggs, broiler hens, and a whole lot  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:02:18):**  more, with longer term plans of food forests and perennial systems beginning to mature  
**[0:02:23-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:02:23):**  already.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:02:24):**  Now, I almost never go over an hour in my interviews unless the subject matter is really  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:02:28):**  good, so the fact that this one is just over an hour and 20 should really tell you something.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:02:33):**  Richard starts by explaining why it's so important to bring back small mixed production  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:02:37):**  farms all over the world, and then jumps right into practical and actionable information  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:02:42):**  by going into the 7 tenets of regenerative agriculture that he's outlined as the most  
**[0:02:46-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:02:46):**  important aspects to aim for.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:02:49):**  We also talked at length about how to solve the farm cash flow problem by finding alternative  
**[0:02:54-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:02:54):**  models and markets to sell to, how to intensify rather than merely grow your farm enterprises,  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:03:00):**  how to holistically develop key ecosystems on the farm by building soil, and a whole  
**[0:03:05-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:03:05):**  lot more.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:03:06):**  This is definitely an interview you'll want to listen to with a notebook on hand, and  
**[0:03:10-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:03:10):**  don't forget to check out the links to some of the projects that we mentioned in the interview  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:03:13):**  on the show notes on the website.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:03:16):**  So now I'll turn things over to Richard Perkins.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:03:18):**  Hello, Richard, and welcome to the Abundant Edge podcast.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:03:21):**  Thank you so much for making the time to be here.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:03:23):**  Hi, Oliver.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:03:24):**  Thanks.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:03:25):**  How are you doing today?  
**[0:03:26-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:03:26):**  Yeah, great.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:03:27):**  Great to join you.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:03:28):**  Thanks for having me on.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:03:29):**  Hey, it's our pleasure.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:03:30):**  Now, before we get into the meat of our questions today, could you take a moment to tell our  
**[0:03:34-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:03:34):**  listeners about how you first got into agriculture and specifically regenerative food production  
**[0:03:40-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:03:40):**  and permaculture?  
**[0:03:41-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:03:41):**  Sure.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:03:42):**  Well, I went to ag school, and I was 18.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:03:46):**  I went into organic agriculture school in the UK where I'm from.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:03:51):**  And my journey into making that decision had begun several years earlier, living with some  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:03:59):**  gypsy people in the UK who had intimate knowledge with the landscape around them, the Romani  
**[0:04:05-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:04:05):**  gypsies who know how to survive off and make a living from the landscape.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:04:12):**  That inspired me a lot, and I knew from a very young age that I wanted to farm.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:04:17):**  I didn't know how that would look.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:04:19):**  And coming in from the UK, land is very expensive, and access to land is a big challenge, which  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:04:25):**  is obviously a big issue for people all over the world.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:04:29):**  But I went to ag school and did organic horticulture and crop production.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:04:35):**  And to be honest, it was very disappointing.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:04:37):**  It was not very advanced level learning for me.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:04:44):**  And I left with more questions and answers.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:04:46):**  And so that's when I first came across permaculture and those kind of ideas.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:04:52):**  And I went traveling and visited a lot of places, talked to a lot of people, but no  
**[0:04:56-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:04:56):**  one could really convince me of useful ways forward from an agricultural perspective,  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:05:04):**  because my interest has always been farming.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:05:08):**  I'm into the whole scene in some ways, and I'm up for small holding and looking after  
**[0:05:15-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:05:15):**  my own needs too.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:05:16):**  But I'm always coming from an agricultural perspective.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:05:21):**  And so naturally, I've been keeping tabs with larger scale projects and the design of those  
**[0:05:28-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:05:28):**  over the years.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:05:29):**  And yeah, it's been a long journey that's taken me all over the place.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:05:34):**  But ever since about the age of 18, I knew for sure I would end up farming.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:05:40):**  I didn't expect to end up in Sweden in a colder and more expensive country in the UK, to be  
**[0:05:46-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:05:46):**  honest.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:05:47):**  And the chances to land here is much easier, and I started a relationship and could afford  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:05:53):**  to buy a farm with cash.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:05:56):**  And I thought, well, why not?  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:05:57):**  Because a lot of people were quite surprised I moved here with such harsh winters.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:06:02):**  We're at 59 degrees north here.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:06:05):**  And so it's really, we get about three and a half months without frost guaranteed.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:06:11):**  And last frost here comes June 7th in our little microclimate region where we're in  
**[0:06:18-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:06:18):**  and can come again in mid-September.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:06:19):**  So it's a pretty harsh environment to eke out a living from the land, certainly on a  
**[0:06:26-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:06:26):**  small scale farm.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:06:27):**  But if you can, then you get a very long winter to recuperate and to plan for the next season.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:06:35):**  And I think something to point out for your listeners is like at this latitude, it's quite  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:06:40):**  different to further down south in Europe where in the summer it's only dark for about  
**[0:06:46-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:06:46):**  three, four hours and it doesn't really go dark.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:06:48):**  It's dusky.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:06:49):**  So you tend to have this explosive production where you work very long hours in the summer.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:06:55):**  And then winter is the opposite.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:06:56):**  It's totally dark.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:06:57):**  And, you know, farm chores take a couple of hours a day in the wintertime.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:07:01):**  Yeah, I got a little taste of that season when I did fishing work up in Alaska.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:07:06):**  It's quite a thing to experience.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:07:09):**  Yeah, yeah, it changes your rhythm of life.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:07:13):**  And it's actually got so many benefits.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:07:15):**  I mean, it's amazing for pest and disease cycles.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:07:18):**  I mean, as a market gardener here, we get very few problems that many of your listeners  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:07:24):**  will have just because of the severity of the winter.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:07:29):**  But it's a pleasurable place to farm.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:07:31):**  It's a very beautiful country and I'm very happy I landed here actually.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:07:36):**  Certainly.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:07:37):**  All right, now let's get into it a little bit.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:07:39):**  As most of my listeners are aware, the increase of monocrop industrial agriculture has had  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:07:45):**  devastating effects on our environment as well as our culture.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:07:49):**  Can you tell me a bit about why it's so important to reintroduce small mixed and diverse farms,  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:07:55):**  much like yours, and the benefits that the return to this form of agriculture bring with  
**[0:08:00-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:08:00):**  it?  
**[0:08:01-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:08:01):**  Yeah, well, there's many aspects to that question, but I think that it's really important to  
**[0:08:10-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:08:10):**  from understanding the history of farming, coming from the UK and certainly European  
**[0:08:16-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:08:16):**  and American context of these climate zones, farming was always small, diverse mixed farms  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:08:23):**  until the war efforts essentially.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:08:28):**  And there were good reasons for that, for ecosystem processes and maintaining soil health  
**[0:08:34-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:08:34):**  and nutrient cycling and producing essentially a whole farm menu.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:08:41):**  Something unusual about our farm, we're farming 10 hectares, 25 acres, and that's a very small  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:08:47):**  farm that wouldn't even be considered a farm in Swedish terms.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:08:52):**  It's actually legislation-wise, it's not classed as a farm.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:08:57):**  And yet we can drive several full-time salaries out of this in the six months production season.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:09:03):**  And it's quite important to me to, you know, the reason I'm farming is primarily to produce  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:09:13):**  my own needs, and then I produce surplus to sell.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:09:18):**  And so we're farming a whole human diet from dairy to pastured meats to eggs to vegetables,  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:09:24):**  to mushrooms, and a lot of wild foods that we can harvest here.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:09:30):**  Sweden's got an abundance of fish and meat walking through the forest, as well as mushrooms  
**[0:09:36-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:09:36):**  that it's quite famous for.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:09:38):**  So there's certain times of year where we're not really focused on farming, we're focused  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:09:41):**  on harvesting those wild yields, which amounts to, you know, tens of thousands of euros worth  
**[0:09:47-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:09:47):**  of product.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:09:48):**  I mean, it's sheer abundance here in the fall.  
**[0:09:52-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:09:52):**  But I think, yeah, for me, building soil is just fundamental for the future of any of  
**[0:10:00-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:10:00):**  our agricultural systems.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:10:01):**  If you're not building soil, it can't go on.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:10:04):**  And it's just not good enough, because we have all the knowledge how to do this.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:10:08):**  People have known how to maintain soil health for a very long time, despite all of the rhetoric  
**[0:10:17-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:10:17):**  around farming being so destructive.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:10:19):**  There have been good farmers all over the world for thousands of years.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:10:25):**  And we need to apply modern ecosystem science and systems thinking to some of these old  
**[0:10:33-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:10:33):**  methods many times.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:10:34):**  A lot of what we're doing is not new.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:10:35):**  I mean, you know, the past and poultry models that we run that have been made famous by  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:10:41):**  people like Joe Salatin, these have been operated for over 100 years now.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:10:47):**  And it's often the things we're doing are building on many people's work over generations.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:10:53):**  But I think, you know, if we're truly students of ecology, then we need to start thinking  
**[0:10:58-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:10:58):**  in whole systems.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:11:00):**  And whole systems require animals, perennial plants, annual plants.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:11:04):**  And there's no real way around that.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:11:06):**  If you want to close nutrient cycles and have ecosystems regenerating and building in health  
**[0:11:13-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:11:13):**  and diversity, then it's fundamental in my mind to either farm diversely or work closely  
**[0:11:20-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:11:20):**  with immediate farms around to create a wider but still closed nutrient loop as it were.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:11:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:11:29):**  And I think it's really important to reiterate the idea that this is not new.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:11:35):**  In fact, it's not even that old.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:11:36):**  I myself, I'm only one generation removed from my grandfather who grew up on a small  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:11:42):**  mixed farm and watched the transition of like when he was a child, he actually saw the first  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:11:48):**  tractor come on the land.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:11:50):**  And in the 30 years that he remained in farming, by the time he left, there were satellite  
**[0:11:55-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:11:55):**  tracking fully automated large combines that, you know, basically were controlled by computer.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:12:03):**  And that's an extremely fast growth and change of an industry.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:12:09):**  And you really only have to go maybe one or two generations back to go to a direct source  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:12:14):**  of how life and farming worked back then.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:12:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:12:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:12:20):**  It's really, I encourage people to read up on the history of the country's agriculture  
**[0:12:24-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:12:24):**  because it's fascinating.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:12:26):**  But you know, the beauty of this whole thing is that soil is really easy to build.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:12:31):**  It's easy to destroy it and it's really easy to build.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:12:34):**  And there have been people over the centuries of written history that have known how to  
**[0:12:38-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:12:38):**  do that and have written about it.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:12:41):**  And they were often, you know, out on the extremes of their culture and seen as slightly  
**[0:12:45-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:12:45):**  weird or doing weird things.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:12:47):**  But people knew how to do that.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:12:49):**  And I think there's a lot we can gain from looking back, you know, just the old rotational  
**[0:12:54-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:12:54):**  systems in the country where I grew up worked very well for a very long time until the global  
**[0:13:01-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:13:01):**  food market changed everything.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:13:03):**  You know, it worked in the context and the time, place and circumstance that it was developed  
**[0:13:07-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:13:07):**  in.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:13:08):**  And so there's a lot can be, if we're looking to go back to more localized food systems,  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:13:13):**  certainly nation based food systems is a good start.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:13:17):**  Then those old methods from before the Second World War and now European climate would,  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:13:24):**  you know, be a good place to start from and then apply some modern systems thinking to  
**[0:13:28-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:13:28):**  that.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:13:29):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:13:30):**  Now, I want to try and unpack this term regenerative farming for a second because there's a lot  
**[0:13:36-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:13:36):**  that goes into it.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:13:37):**  And I've seen in one of your online seminars that you have a list of about seven tenants  
**[0:13:43-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:13:43):**  for regenerative farming, essentially like the core principles that maybe aren't absolutely  
**[0:13:47-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:13:47):**  essential, but certainly what you would aspire to, to consider your enterprise regenerative.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:13:53):**  And if you don't mind, I'm going to kind of list them off one by one.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:13:57):**  And if you could just sort of help to explain very briefly each one of these criteria and  
**[0:14:03-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:14:03):**  how it sort of affects or works in a practical sense on a farm.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:14:07):**  All right, so let's start by building soil.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:14:09):**  Obviously, this is essential.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:14:10):**  Yeah, for me, everything we're doing must build soil.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:14:14):**  Doesn't matter if you're growing vegetables, planting trees, raising animals on pasture,  
**[0:14:18-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:14:18):**  whatever it is, we need to be looking at how ecosystem processes function in the equivalent  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:14:24):**  of the natural version of that system and find a way to build soil.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:14:29):**  And I think, you know, there's methods for all agricultural enterprises I've ever seen  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:14:34):**  to build soil, the hardest to get our heads outside the box is with annual cultivation  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:14:40):**  and vegetable growing, which is why we have chosen the no dig approach because tillage  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:14:45):**  is the quickest way to burn carbon out of your soil.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:14:49):**  Certainly.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:14:50):**  But essentially, yeah, we need to move towards very low tillage or no tillage models for  
**[0:14:55-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:14:55):**  production.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:14:56):**  And the other thing I think a lot of people don't realize is, you know, if you go out  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:14:59):**  into a piece of land, even if you consider it to be fairly healthy, you go and measure  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:15:04):**  the topsoil and maybe it's a handful of inches or like 10 centimeters or so.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:15:08):**  And we kind of consider that normal and healthy.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:15:11):**  But give us a little context as to what you would consider healthy soil depths to be.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:15:18):**  Well that's going to look different in different parts of the world.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:15:21):**  You know, there's reports of Europeans going down to Africa or to America when the great  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:15:26):**  savannas were still there that have usually turned to desert now in both America and Africa.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:15:31):**  There was ecosystems that had incredibly large herds of bison in America or mixed savanna  
**[0:15:40-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:15:40):**  species in Africa where people were shooting thousands of antelope over a weekend off the  
**[0:15:46-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:15:46):**  back of an elephant from pleasure.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:15:48):**  You know, if you can fire a loud gun and shoot 3000 antelope in a weekend, then that gives  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:15:54):**  you an indication of just how dense the animal populations were.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:15:58):**  And on those grasslands, you would have found nine meter deep topsoil, which is now, you  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:16:03):**  know, over most of those regions, 10, 15 centimeters, like you say, and that carbon is all up in  
**[0:16:09-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:16:09):**  the atmosphere.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:16:10):**  But that looks different in different parts of the world.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:16:12):**  Here for example, we're farming very mixed soils that were underwater not so long ago  
**[0:16:19-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:16:19):**  in history.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:16:20):**  Ah, in the ice ages.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:16:22):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:16:23):**  And, you know, we've gone from, I've been putting videos out this summer as we've done  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:16:28):**  a lot of soil tests with the treatments we've done in our past is a primarily animal based  
**[0:16:33-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:16:33):**  and poultry based at that and poultry are really the key animal for small farms in my  
**[0:16:38-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:16:38):**  mind.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:16:39):**  And just for the sheer density of animals you can put on the system, but we've pulled  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:16:45):**  a key lime plow through all of our agroforestry systems arranged on the key lime layout and  
**[0:16:50-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:16:50):**  we've pulled our key lime plow through twice and we've put a lot of meat chickens and laying  
**[0:16:57-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:16:57):**  hens and also cow and sheep herds following them over our grasslands using holistic plan  
**[0:17:04-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:17:04):**  grazing and we've built topsoil 25 centimeters in three six months growing seasons and we  
**[0:17:11-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:17:11):**  now have, I would say the best pasture in the village.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:17:15):**  We had some of the worst land when we moved here because there'd been no animals on this  
**[0:17:19-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:17:19):**  farm for several decades.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:17:21):**  But things transform radically in response to animals particularly.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:17:28):**  Ecosystem processes.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:17:29):**  Yeah, that's a real remarkable turnaround.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:17:31):**  Yeah, and it's doable anyway.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:17:33):**  I mean processes are slow here so if it's working here up this far north, I mean it's  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:17:40):**  radical what can be done slightly for south weather temperatures and growth season is  
**[0:17:45-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:17:45):**  a lot longer.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:17:46):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:17:47):**  All right, let's move on to the next criteria that a farm is holistically managed.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:17:52):**  What does that mean?  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:17:54):**  Well to me that's reflecting back the importance of Alan Savory's work with holistic management  
**[0:17:59-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:17:59):**  which is primarily decision making framework.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:18:02):**  Most people are coming into contact with his work through the grazing of livestock and  
**[0:18:07-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:18:07):**  that bit is important too.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:18:10):**  But what Alan's work really gives us is a decision making framework that allows us to  
**[0:18:15-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:18:15):**  deal with complexity, to make decisions with economy, ecology and society which are all  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:18:22):**  complex by nature, i.e. they transform and grow in ways that we can't predict which  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:18:27):**  as farmers we must automatically work with.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:18:32):**  And so this decision making matrix as it were allows us to really get clear in our personal  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:18:39):**  and holistic context of what we're trying to achieve in life, what we value in life,  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:18:44):**  what we commit to to enable us to have that quality of life that we said we want and then  
**[0:18:49-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:18:49):**  how to design a way to ensure that that quality of life is available for great grandkids and  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:18:56):**  great great grandkids and think in a very long term perspective.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:19:00):**  So it brings us back to a decision making model.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:19:04):**  There's testing questions put forward by Alan Savory who's basically adapted this decision  
**[0:19:09-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:19:09):**  making framework from military planning.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:19:11):**  You know military planning, obviously they're making very quick decisions in very intense  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:19:18):**  situations and so he adapted that decision making framework for farming you could say  
**[0:19:23-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:19:23):**  or for any decision making that we need in our lives.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:19:27):**  And that's been fundamental to the rapid implementation of our farm and it's made some of our biggest  
**[0:19:35-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:19:35):**  decisions are incredibly fast to make and very easeful.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:19:38):**  We don't sit around trying to make decisions and we haven't ever done that.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:19:43):**  It's very easy to make decisions when you're very clear on what you're trying to achieve.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:19:48):**  So I think for me it's a big step up for the permaculture world which has never had a really  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:19:52):**  good decision making framework or design process.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:19:57):**  Just to add another part to that, I mean another big part of my work is key line design, the  
**[0:20:02-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:20:02):**  work of Pierre Yeomans and that really gives us a structural organization for permaculture  
**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:20:09):**  design using what's called Yeoman scale of permanence.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:20:12):**  So my work really revolves around holistic management, key line design and permaculture  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:20:18):**  and the synthesis of those three.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:20:20):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:20:21):**  Alright let's go to the next one.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:20:24):**  Mimicking ecological processes.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:20:26):**  Yeah so that's something that anyone that's familiar with permaculture will be well aware  
**[0:20:32-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:20:32):**  of and I think it's really important that people get more in tune with the ecosystems  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:20:38):**  they're working in because a lot of the permaculture principles if you read various books they're  
**[0:20:43-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:20:43):**  often not grounded in very tangible relatable formats for people coming into this.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:20:49):**  I see a lot of young people who are aspiring entrepreneurial farmers who are not coming  
**[0:20:54-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:20:54):**  from farming backgrounds.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:20:56):**  And to be honest I think I have more hope in the future of real integrity food production  
**[0:21:02-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:21:02):**  coming from those kind of people.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:21:04):**  People that can eke out a living from low resources in interesting situations that traditional  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:21:12):**  farmers wouldn't be able to work out a plan for.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:21:16):**  But some of those lovely ecological ideas we're presented with are not so immediately  
**[0:21:23-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:21:23):**  applicable to landscapes.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:21:25):**  Like if we're grazing livestock on pasture we need to study grassland ecosystem.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:21:31):**  You know that's all we need to study.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:21:33):**  We don't need to study sort of abstract patterns.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:21:38):**  We need to look at the processes that happen in pristine forests if we want to study agroforestry  
**[0:21:45-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:21:45):**  and put in agroforestry systems.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:21:48):**  So I think yeah it's obvious we need to mimic ecosystem processes.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:21:53):**  And yeah from our patterns to details way too we need to understand how water works  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:21:59):**  in a global context to be able to understand how to apply it in our unique time, place  
**[0:22:05-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:22:05):**  and circumstance.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:22:06):**  And something like keyline design really empowers that particularly with water.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:22:12):**  Certainly there are all these you know there's all of the work of these great people that  
**[0:22:18-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:22:18):**  I've mentioned already and people like PA Yeoman, Ellen Savory have given us a set of  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:22:24):**  recipes that can be combined or some thrown out as a less more or less applicable and  
**[0:22:30-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:22:30):**  allow us to like really dive deep into understanding ecosystem processes and how soils really function.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:22:39):**  Yeah that's very well put.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:22:41):**  Let's talk now about local inputs and outputs.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:22:44):**  Yeah that maybe comes across a little vague but it's you know I think we need to move  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:22:50):**  back towards localized food systems and that's you know tied into why I think diverse farming  
**[0:22:55-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:22:55):**  is so important because you know take for example the rise of modern market gardening  
**[0:23:02-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:23:02):**  it's extremely popular and probably the fastest growing aspect of you know agriculture in  
**[0:23:09-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:23:09):**  this sort of alternative scene as it were.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:23:12):**  But in those cases the you know it's very unless we're looking in a full whole systems  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:23:18):**  perspective it's very hard to quantify like what is sustainable.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:23:22):**  You know if you look at the average Facebook feed you see meat is bad, vegetables good  
**[0:23:27-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:23:27):**  but when you really unpack it and certainly from a regenerative ag perspective I mean  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:23:32):**  vegetable production is the least sustainable thing out there.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:23:36):**  It takes the most time and the most important resources to produce the least calories and  
**[0:23:41-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:23:41):**  actually turning sunlight into grass into flesh and exporting nothing but bones off  
**[0:23:48-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:23:48):**  site is perhaps the most well not even sustainable most regenerative thing you could do.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:23:55):**  And so it's important that we look at the whole systems to really analyze inputs and  
**[0:24:00-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:24:00):**  outputs but it's also a more practical way of thinking about that in terms of food miles  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:24:08):**  you know reducing the amount of diesel we put on our food as it were.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:24:13):**  And that's where I think you know this new emergence of entrepreneurial farmers are able  
**[0:24:21-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:24:21):**  to embed themselves in the middle of their communities and produce like what the thing  
**[0:24:25-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:24:25):**  that we can do on a small farm like this we can never out compete the economy of scales  
**[0:24:31-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:24:31):**  of industrial farming but we can always out compete on quality, freshness and locality.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:24:38):**  And so there are leverage points that we have to go with and more and more people are tuning  
**[0:24:45-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:24:45):**  into that kind of food production and wanting to know where their food comes from.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:24:49):**  So it also has so many other little practical benefits of reducing costs, you know reducing  
**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:24:56):**  the amount of oil and technology needed.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:25:00):**  You know we supply thousands of meat chickens and we supply veg boxes to the equivalent  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:25:09):**  of 100 families throughout the season and other meat boxes etc.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:25:14):**  And we don't have a refrigerated vehicle because we don't need one because we pick vegetables  
**[0:25:19-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:25:19):**  and then the customers have within an hour.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:25:21):**  So we don't need any of that infrastructure or excessive oil or technology to provide  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:25:26):**  the highest quality produce locally.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:25:30):**  And then you know it really facilitates our customers getting to know us and building  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:25:35):**  that relationship and bond that gives us financial security ultimately.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:25:39):**  People that are willing to pay us up front for the seasons production to help us manage  
**[0:25:44-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:25:44):**  cash flow for example.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:25:45):**  Yeah and I really like what you mentioned a minute ago about how meat systems are actually  
**[0:25:51-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:25:51):**  absolutely essential for a fully regenerative and holistic land model.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:25:55):**  I know that this is one of maybe the more contested topics when it comes to agriculture  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:26:02):**  and it can get a little bit tricky because obviously many more calories per square meter  
**[0:26:07-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:26:07):**  can be produced through vegetable or plant production.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:26:12):**  However animals end up converting all of the plant matter and biomass that is not bioavailable  
**[0:26:19-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:26:19):**  to humans into something that we can consume at a very high nutrient density.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:26:26):**  And you know like you were also talking about earlier there is really no ecosystem anywhere  
**[0:26:31-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:26:31):**  in the world that has existed without the inputs of animals and basically taking their  
**[0:26:38-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:26:38):**  labor and their inputs as a major contribution to the fertility of those zones.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:26:44):**  Yeah I mean it's a very clear point and I think it's actually simpler than you know  
**[0:26:50-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:26:50):**  than a lot of people might think because I think that yeah it's very true to say there  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:26:58):**  are no animal less ecosystems but what I think most people don't understand is just the sheer  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:27:03):**  number of animals that used to roam the planet.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:27:07):**  And I remember the what was that project up in Siberia where they're bringing back all  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:27:13):**  the they want to bring back mammoths and I fully support that but they're working with  
**[0:27:18-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:27:18):**  bison and yaks and Pleistocene parks you remember that one?  
**[0:27:24-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:27:24):**  No I haven't seen that one.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:27:25):**  Oh well that's awesome these guys are they're studying their scientists studying the permafrost  
**[0:27:31-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:27:31):**  and they're trying to use holistic management to bring back Pleistocene era that's the ultimate  
**[0:27:40-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:27:40):**  goal is to bring back Pleistocene era grazing animals to restore the grasslands to stop  
**[0:27:47-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:27:47):**  the spread of the melting of permafrost.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:27:50):**  But what excited me most about what they have been studying in the fossil records or sorry  
**[0:27:57-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:27:57):**  the bone records as the ice melts is they're finding there were one woolly mammoth per  
**[0:28:03-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:28:03):**  hectare 30 elk what we call elk in American is moose so 30 moose per hectare and something  
**[0:28:15-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:28:15):**  like 50 deer all of them on one hectare that's what they're finding in the riverbanks in  
**[0:28:21-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:28:21):**  the bone records now that's the same as you know 60 or 100 million bison running around  
**[0:28:27-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:28:27):**  North America or 3,000 antelope being shot over a weekend for fun you know those numbers  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:28:33):**  are so off our charts and I just see this.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:28:38):**  And it also completely dwarfs animal production that we're using horribly consumptive methods  
**[0:28:44-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:28:44):**  to produce and you could potentially get a ton more caloric value by bringing back these  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:28:52):**  herding animals and managing them holistically potentially.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:28:56):**  Yeah for sure now it's a very complex picture you know but it's got to be based on building  
**[0:29:00-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:29:00):**  soil and that's why we need much more livestock it's obvious I mean so much of the damaged  
**[0:29:07-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:29:07):**  land around the world was grassland or savannah land more specifically but I don't think it's  
**[0:29:12-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:29:12):**  a good unit of measure to compare calories I mean that's a sort of you know.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:29:18):**  Yeah that's kind of a dull way or a very very incomplete way to measure that I agree.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:29:25):**  Yeah I mean you know a hectare of corn is pretty empty calories and yeah I don't think  
**[0:29:30-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:29:30):**  they are comparable we know we need meats we need dairy we need annual crops and we  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:29:36):**  need perennial crops and we need to fit them into the habitats we come from.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:29:42):**  Sure and not all the animals that we prefer to eat are the appropriate ones for each landscape  
**[0:29:47-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:29:47):**  that we're trying to regenerate either.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:29:50):**  No and it's worth you know pointing out that all the animals we farm are a very long way  
**[0:29:56-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:29:56):**  from their ancestral counterparts in both their habits and their impacts but we got  
**[0:30:01-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:30:01):**  to work you know with reality with what we've got but I think an important part of planning  
**[0:30:06-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:30:06):**  and designing farms is to choose the appropriate livestock or enterprises for the scale particularly  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:30:14):**  the scale we're working at so that we can get that intensity because the vast improvement  
**[0:30:19-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:30:19):**  that's happened at our farm which is mind-blowing is based on the sheer number of poultry we  
**[0:30:25-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:30:25):**  have you know if we had 10 cows and 20 sheep running around there wouldn't be any marked  
**[0:30:33-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:30:33):**  increase in the quality of forage or you know length of growing season of our grass.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:30:39):**  I mean most people have put the cows in in September here and we've got active grass  
**[0:30:45-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:30:45):**  growing still now in November we're going to be probably grazing outdoors till mid or  
**[0:30:52-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:30:52):**  late December this year and eventually get down to like only needing to feed hay two  
**[0:30:57-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:30:57):**  or three months and that's come from building soil by mimicking ecosystem processes and  
**[0:31:03-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:31:03):**  I think that's a big part of the animal picture that most people don't get from the ecological  
**[0:31:07-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:31:07):**  perspective is just the sheer amount of animals needed to function with the plants that they  
**[0:31:15-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:31:15):**  evolve with.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:31:16):**  Yeah absolutely.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:31:18):**  Let's go to number five here low oil fiscal and technical and infrastructural inputs on  
**[0:31:25-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:31:25):**  the land.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:31:27):**  Yeah that one relates to the previous point too just about you know needing less inputs  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:31:32):**  from outside the farm and needing less capital to start up most of the people that I've come  
**[0:31:37-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:31:37):**  across who want to get into farming don't have land or don't have money or both and  
**[0:31:44-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:31:44):**  I think you know there are very smart ways to start up is what shaped our farm.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:31:49):**  You know we're also a demonstration farm but it was part of to me to put the farm first  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:31:55):**  and education came second and say hey the farm's got to stand alone and work as a farm  
**[0:32:00-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:32:00):**  but we also wanted to use specifically enterprises that were suitable to be scaled.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:32:07):**  They're all modular and can be scaled instantly some of them and could be expanded to different  
**[0:32:14-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:32:14):**  climatic contexts within reason but to really be facilitate us to educate people to get  
**[0:32:21-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:32:21):**  started on a shoestring and turn profit in their first year.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:32:24):**  So every single one of our enterprises can pay off its enterprise investments in the  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:32:29):**  first year and make a profit and that's revolutionary.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:32:33):**  You know that means someone in their 20s with 20 grand in their pocket can start up one  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:32:38):**  of these enterprises on rented land and earn a good salary like a really respectable salary  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:32:43):**  from the first year onwards and that's not how farming used to look and it's very possible.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:32:49):**  No that's a game changer for sure.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:32:51):**  Yeah and the reason I've put low technology inputs is that we're working with ecosystem  
**[0:32:57-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:32:57):**  processes and that's the only way we can build soil is we need to be observant farmers and  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:33:05):**  you can't produce the results that we've been demonstrating here without that observation  
**[0:33:10-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:33:10):**  and that comes from people paying very close attention to ecosystem processes.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:33:16):**  Technology and automated systems have their place but they usually turn people off is  
**[0:33:21-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:33:21):**  my experience with working with a lot of people all over the world is as soon as something's  
**[0:33:26-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:33:26):**  automated someone says I don't have to check them anymore and that misses the point and  
**[0:33:31-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:33:31):**  there's a danger with these automations.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:33:33):**  Certainly.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:33:34):**  All right now let's move to another one that I'd actually like to go into more depth in  
**[0:33:39-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:33:39):**  and that's having your products certified by your customers rather than some regulatory  
**[0:33:45-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:33:45):**  body.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:33:46):**  Sure well for me that's all about the intimacy of management.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:33:50):**  We actually said the 50 kilometer selling radius around our farm not for any other reason  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:33:55):**  than hey why don't you go and set up a farm 100 kilometers away and do the same.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:34:00):**  And I'm really interested in this idea of you know having a hundred 10 hectare farms  
**[0:34:06-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:34:06):**  around a town or city here then having a thousand hectare farm produced in some monocultural  
**[0:34:12-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:34:12):**  crop that no one in the city even eats.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:34:15):**  You know in my work consulting and doing project design I've come across farmers producing  
**[0:34:21-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:34:21):**  you know thousands of litres of milk out the back door and they don't even drink their  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:34:25):**  own milk they go and buy milk in the store and this is this is nuts.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:34:29):**  So I'm interested in putting farms back in the middle of community and you know partly  
**[0:34:41-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:34:41):**  to make them visible again partly to make people more aware of you know what goes into  
**[0:34:47-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:34:47):**  producing their food.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:34:49):**  But when the customer is free to walk around the farm free to ask questions comes to the  
**[0:34:54-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:34:54):**  farm to pick up things and it's good for business but it's also good for creating this intimate  
**[0:35:02-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:35:02):**  relationship with local people who basically are going to support us in good times and  
**[0:35:08-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:35:08):**  bad.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:35:09):**  I mean we have an interesting selling model where we sell everything pretty much like  
**[0:35:13-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:35:13):**  a CSA up front and helps with our cash flow.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:35:17):**  But the only reason we can do that is that we know all of our customers and they totally  
**[0:35:21-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:35:21):**  trust us.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:35:22):**  We are certified organic and we only buy inorganic feeds and we stick to organic standards except  
**[0:35:29-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:35:29):**  for a couple of things.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:35:30):**  One example could be inorganic standards here a broiler chicken must be a certain number  
**[0:35:37-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:35:37):**  of days old before it's slaughtered.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:35:40):**  We have a small approved slaughter facility on our farm and we choose to slaughter birds  
**[0:35:46-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:35:46):**  over several weeks to even out their weights.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:35:49):**  And we like to do the first slaughter at a slightly younger age than the European standard  
**[0:35:54-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:35:54):**  which wouldn't be allowed if our beds were organic certified but they're not so we can  
**[0:35:58-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:35:58):**  do that.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:36:00):**  And so for me I need to make those decisions for myself for what's best for the land for  
**[0:36:06-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:36:06):**  my customers, for me financially, not some bureaucrat in Brussels deciding some arbitrary  
**[0:36:12-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:36:12):**  number that has nothing to do with the breed of chicken I'm working with.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:36:17):**  And my customers don't mind that because I'll tell them that we're very open and honest  
**[0:36:22-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:36:22):**  about what we do with our customers.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:36:24):**  We have big open days and tours just for our customers and we show them and get them excited.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:36:31):**  There's old ladies in the village that get down on their hands and knees and they're  
**[0:36:34-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:36:34):**  crawling through the pasture and learning things that I wish they knew since they were  
**[0:36:39-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:36:39):**  10.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:36:40):**  But I get excited about it.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:36:42):**  But this is the basis of food security and community food resilience is when people know  
**[0:36:48-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:36:48):**  their farmers and they can decide and all of our customers really don't care that we're  
**[0:36:55-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:36:55):**  not certified organic because they know we only feed organic.  
**[0:36:58-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:36:58):**  They know we're going better than that.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:36:59):**  They're all aiming to go beyond that as it were.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:37:02):**  So it's a really important thing and I've done a lot of consulting where I've only ever  
**[0:37:08-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:37:08):**  told one or two people that I think it makes sense that they go down that route just due  
**[0:37:13-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:37:13):**  to the specific marketplace that they find themselves in.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:37:17):**  But here in Sweden especially organic certification is not really revered.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:37:24):**  People value local more than they value organic and that's partly due to propaganda put out  
**[0:37:31-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:37:31):**  by the largest agricultural college in the country.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:37:34):**  So yeah it's important to tap into that but I would say that that would be my approach  
**[0:37:41-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:37:41):**  across all the countries I visited.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:37:43):**  I think there's a lot of jaded people looking at organic certifications that anything you  
**[0:37:53-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:37:53):**  can buy in a Western supermarket that's organic is probably not produced in a way that's holistically  
**[0:37:58-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:37:58):**  managed or building soil mimicking ecosystem.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:38:01):**  Yeah a good 90% of the time at least.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:38:06):**  You mentioned that you had sort of solved your cash flow problem by pre-selling most  
**[0:38:11-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:38:11):**  of your products and I know that at one point, I don't know if you still do it, you had your  
**[0:38:15-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:38:15):**  own currency as well.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:38:16):**  Could you tell me about how you sort of set that up and how it solved your cash flow problems?  
**[0:38:23-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:38:23):**  Yeah well that's you know cash flow is the biggest thing to manage on the farm because  
**[0:38:29-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:38:29):**  driving a profit is pretty easy for most of these enterprises but managing cash flow throughout  
**[0:38:35-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:38:35):**  the season especially if you have a complex business like ours is much easier if you have  
**[0:38:40-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:38:40):**  a single enterprise that's for sure but we have you know multiple enterprises going on  
**[0:38:46-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:38:46):**  all the time and in the summer it's very intense and there's a lot of costs going out early  
**[0:38:54-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:38:54):**  in the season obviously you're getting products some of them are only sold later in the year  
**[0:38:58-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:38:58):**  so cash flow is the main issue so we wanted to start up in a way where we had a bit of  
**[0:39:06-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:39:06):**  safety because I was just moving to a foreign country and didn't have any knowledge of the  
**[0:39:12-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:39:12):**  marketplace to begin with or language etc and so we thought we'd apply the sort of CSA  
**[0:39:20-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:39:20):**  model or paying up front for things with our passive poultry so we actually made up a like  
**[0:39:27-0:39:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:39:27):**  we knew we could produce birds that average 2.2 2.3 kilos and so what we did is we made  
**[0:39:34-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:39:34):**  like the original Swedish currency is called a riksdaler and because of ridge dale ridge  
**[0:39:42-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:39:42):**  dale came about because our property is called Orson which is a ridge and we're in Frikstaden  
**[0:39:48-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:39:48):**  which is the valley of Frik in the lake to the south of us so ridges and dales is where  
**[0:39:54-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:39:54):**  we are situated and so because of the name of the original Swedish currency we thought  
**[0:40:01-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:40:01):**  we would call it a ridge dale and it has this kind of pun in Swedish it sounds like original  
**[0:40:07-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:40:07):**  currency but it also sounds like the farm obviously so we made this little voucher and  
**[0:40:12-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:40:12):**  it was you know a nice little design voucher that's basically you could buy for we're selling  
**[0:40:18-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:40:18):**  about 10 euros a kilo for past goods and poultry at the time so you could buy two kilos up  
**[0:40:24-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:40:24):**  front and we knew it would be more than two kilos so we could just settle it on collection  
**[0:40:29-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:40:29):**  and so we put that out and started pre-selling birds and and passive poultry is the most  
**[0:40:36-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:40:36):**  scalable of all the enterprises and it's also the most profitable of any of the enterprises  
**[0:40:41-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:40:41):**  we run both time and you know returns and it's a beautiful enterprise for people going  
**[0:40:49-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:40:49):**  into farming particularly which is why I still stand behind it despite you know some of the  
**[0:40:55-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:40:55):**  things I don't enjoy about the enterprise because in eight weeks I can turn around you  
**[0:41:01-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:41:01):**  know 12 to 15 euros profit from a single bird and so if a thousand people suddenly order  
**[0:41:08-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:41:08):**  birds I can produce them within two months which can't easily do you can't scale your  
**[0:41:13-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:41:13):**  market garden up and down like that or any tree crops or any larger livestock so it's  
**[0:41:18-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:41:18):**  a really important cash flow moderator so we wanted to put a lot of emphasis on pastured  
**[0:41:24-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:41:24):**  chickens in particular in the first few years because it's very common in the Swedish diet  
**[0:41:30-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:41:30):**  and something I always say to people is like you've got to really start on known foods  
**[0:41:34-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:41:34):**  that people enjoy to eat not producing weird stuff that no one's seen before because it's  
**[0:41:40-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:41:40):**  very hard to sell at volume in that case but anyway this currency did really well it showed  
**[0:41:46-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:41:46):**  us what the market was and it also attracted the you know Sweden's I politely say it's  
**[0:41:53-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:41:53):**  a little bit behind other European countries certainly in terms of you know regenerative  
**[0:41:59-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:41:59):**  ag and permaculture stuff and so it attracted quite a lot of attention we got on prime time  
**[0:42:05-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:42:05):**  TV after after the news at dinner time so that like drove the whole thing forward quite  
**[0:42:11-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:42:11):**  a lot and yeah that was you know just by the chance but then we just started applying that  
**[0:42:17-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:42:17):**  model to everything else the same with the vegetables where we took six months subscriptions  
**[0:42:22-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:42:22):**  for the vegetable boxes we produce and then we do the same with our eggs as well because  
**[0:42:28-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:42:28):**  we always have a higher demand for our eggs than we can produce and each year we've just  
**[0:42:33-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:42:33):**  been doubling and we still are at the stage of doubling now so it's it's a really nice  
**[0:42:41-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:42:41):**  way to like it's become a regular part my partner Hannah does a lot of the or pretty  
**[0:42:48-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:42:48):**  much all of the customer relations stuff and you know it's time to put out new egg subscriptions  
**[0:42:54-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:42:54):**  and it's it's beautiful because people just straight up want to reapply for six months  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:43:00):**  you know and it's it's really confirming that we're producing really good quality stuff  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:43:05):**  that people want to still do that so I think it's an important format but something I would  
**[0:43:10-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:43:10):**  say to be careful with it especially if you're new to farming because you have to be able  
**[0:43:16-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:43:16):**  to deliver now I came to this with a lot of experience with designing and farming and  
**[0:43:21-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:43:21):**  managing people and farms and yeah you need to know you can deliver what you promise or  
**[0:43:28-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:43:28):**  you lose that entire customer base obviously.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:43:31):**  Yeah that's a fantastic story. Let's quickly go to the seventh and last of those tenants  
**[0:43:39-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:43:39):**  namely being that ecologically socially and personally regenerative is the model you're  
**[0:43:45-0:43:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:43:45):**  shooting for. How do all those three sort of correlate and it seems like it's an elaboration  
**[0:43:50-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:43:50):**  on the holistic planning model.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:43:53):**  Yeah for me I think it's really you know it's important that we if we want to move things  
**[0:43:58-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:43:58):**  in a regenerative direction we've got to be managing long term both for ourselves and  
**[0:44:04-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:44:04):**  for the landscape we manage but the community we live in too and I really love the work  
**[0:44:09-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:44:09):**  of Ethan Rowland and Gregory Landau with the regenerative enterprise really defining  
**[0:44:15-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:44:15):**  the eight forms of capital I'm sure some of your listeners are familiar with but I think  
**[0:44:20-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:44:20):**  you know that's an extension of that too in a way and I think it's it's super important  
**[0:44:25-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:44:25):**  that we manage for those things and it can be really I think farming is a juggling game  
**[0:44:31-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:44:31):**  it's really hard to find balance with all those things all the time but it's only something  
**[0:44:36-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:44:36):**  to strive towards and with the understanding that certainly those key three are all required  
**[0:44:43-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:44:43):**  to be stable if we want what we're doing to be long lasting and far reaching.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:44:49):**  All right let's let's shift gears for just a second here with all the resources that  
**[0:44:54-0:44:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:44:54):**  are available to us now through the Internet many people are looking into alternative markets  
**[0:44:59-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:44:59):**  to sell their products and their harvest what advice would you give to folks who have struggled  
**[0:45:03-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:45:03):**  to find a market for their harvest in the past and what have been some of the most successful  
**[0:45:08-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:45:08):**  ways that you found to reliably sell your goods aside from that pre-sell model that  
**[0:45:13-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:45:13):**  you've already talked about?  
**[0:45:15-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:45:15):**  Yeah well that's you know I think that's very contract specific really but I can share a  
**[0:45:21-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:45:21):**  bit of my thoughts I think as I said before I think it's really critical that people start  
**[0:45:26-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:45:26):**  out by producing real food and producing things that people like to eat particularly and I  
**[0:45:36-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:45:36):**  think it's very hard to make a living out of niche products I think like for example  
**[0:45:42-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:45:42):**  eggs is something that is always done great for us we peg our price at standard organic  
**[0:45:47-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:45:47):**  prices and we just can keep doubling I mean I never set out to be a chicken farmer but  
**[0:45:52-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:45:52):**  it's it's such a standard product eggs is something that if you have good eggs that  
**[0:45:56-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:45:56):**  are better than any other eggs for sale you can't really lose those customers and so I  
**[0:46:03-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:46:03):**  think the familiarity of products is really important I must say like where we're situated  
**[0:46:08-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:46:08):**  we're extremely rural and I think that's part of what makes this place potent for people  
**[0:46:14-0:46:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:46:14):**  it you know it's a very different thing if you've got a market garden outside a big city  
**[0:46:20-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:46:20):**  or any kind of farm outside a big city like we're we are really in the middle of nowhere  
**[0:46:25-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:46:25):**  we're in the middle of a triangle between Stockholm, Oslo and Gothenburg in the middle  
**[0:46:31-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:46:31):**  of you know the countryside our nearest town is less than 5,000 people is 25 minutes drive  
**[0:46:40-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:46:40):**  away and so we have one larger town on about 70,000 people about on the edge of our selling  
**[0:46:49-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:46:49):**  radius of about 50 kilometers and there's only a few chefs that run you know higher  
**[0:46:56-0:47:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:46:56):**  end venues that we can sell to in the entire food shed that we're selling to.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:47:05):**  So I think it you know in our circumstance we must produce standards foods and they must  
**[0:47:11-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:47:11):**  be a price that people are willing to pay and so we're not catering to particularly  
**[0:47:17-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:47:17):**  high-end or niche things which I think is the marketplace for a lot of people in this  
**[0:47:21-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:47:21):**  field and so I think you've got to do your market research obviously but one thing that's  
**[0:47:28-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:47:28):**  come up that's changing the way we do everything actually and is changing our subscription  
**[0:47:33-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:47:33):**  model too is this RICO model that's coming up and that's started out of Finland it's  
**[0:47:41-0:47:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:47:41):**  a kind of acronym for fair consumption and it works in the way that we've been doing  
**[0:47:50-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:47:50):**  sales from the farm the last three years but it's evolved it in many ways.  
**[0:47:55-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:47:55):**  Maybe I should take a step back and tell you how we've been selling is not only have we  
**[0:48:01-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:48:01):**  been doing pre-sales which is quite new concept here in Sweden but we've been developing drop-off  
**[0:48:08-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:48:08):**  points and they are very efficient because selling is half the work of producing really  
**[0:48:15-0:48:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:48:15):**  and we haven't got time for being out of the farm and because we live so rurally the marketplaces  
**[0:48:21-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:48:21):**  we have a significantly far away that we don't want to go there for long and so we built  
**[0:48:28-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:48:28):**  up this idea of drop-off points where we turn up we started even in the McDonald's car park  
**[0:48:33-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:48:33):**  and we turned up for 45 minutes with pastured eggs and vegetables and customers meet us  
**[0:48:39-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:48:39):**  there because it's convenient place everyone knows and drop off thousands of years of products  
**[0:48:44-0:48:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:48:44):**  in 30-40 minutes and then get out of there and we've been developing that model over  
**[0:48:50-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:48:50):**  the last few years with like-minded shopkeepers who are very happy for us to come and park  
**[0:48:56-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:48:56):**  up in their premises where people can get free parking or whatever because they get  
**[0:49:02-0:49:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:49:02):**  the footfall traffic to go buy coffee or bread or whatever else that we don't sell.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:49:07):**  So whatever that's been a model.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:49:10):**  Yeah precisely so that's worked really well and it's cut our sales down hugely you know  
**[0:49:15-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:49:15):**  we're turning up between 30 and 45 minutes at two or three drop-off points a week and  
**[0:49:22-0:49:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:49:22):**  selling all our products like that so that's amazing but Ricoh this thing that's taken  
**[0:49:27-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:49:27):**  off has made that even better I think because it's run by Facebook is run via Facebook and  
**[0:49:34-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:49:34):**  essentially it should become consumer managed but we've been quite key in setting up the  
**[0:49:42-0:49:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:49:42):**  local Rico in our bigger city on the edge of our selling zone but basically it's like  
**[0:49:46-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:49:46):**  a farmers market crossed with a drop-off point and everything is pre-sold so each week we  
**[0:49:52-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:49:52):**  put a little ad out on this page and it's very visually based and you put up photos  
**[0:49:59-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:49:59):**  of what you're selling and the price and then people here we have a think or swish where  
**[0:50:03-0:50:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:50:03):**  people pay on the phone and some people like to pay by invoice still or whatever but it's  
**[0:50:09-0:50:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:50:09):**  quite efficient so people can say right I want 10 bunches of vegetables these are the  
**[0:50:15-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:50:15):**  types I would like I want a turkey and half a pig and then you say right it's this much  
**[0:50:21-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:50:21):**  and they pay you and everything is already sold there's no selling allowed at the actual  
**[0:50:25-0:50:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:50:25):**  Rico drop-off so it's very similar to what we were doing except there's many other producers  
**[0:50:31-0:50:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:50:31):**  now both competitors and complementary products so there's a lot more attention like in customers  
**[0:50:37-0:50:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:50:37):**  coming to the events and I think that competition is also really healthy because it drives us  
**[0:50:43-0:50:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:50:43):**  all to do a better job both with products with selling with presentation etc and it's  
**[0:50:49-0:50:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:50:49):**  been really cool and we're hoping actually to stop selling our CSA boxes and only do  
**[0:50:56-0:51:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:50:56):**  this Rico bunch model that we've been using for vegetable sales and we also use the Rico  
**[0:51:04-0:51:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:51:04):**  as our regular drop-off location so at the start of the year we just said to all of our  
**[0:51:09-0:51:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:51:09):**  existing customers hey the this new Rico things kicking off we're very happy to come and drop  
**[0:51:15-0:51:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:51:15):**  off your products again but we're moving the pickup points of this place and the Rico is  
**[0:51:20-0:51:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:51:20):**  always held at a much bigger car park where many people can turn up so it's very convenient  
**[0:51:25-0:51:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:51:25):**  anyway so all of our customers were super happy about that and we're hoping to just  
**[0:51:30-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:51:30):**  keep pushing that model because it really needs it needs people it needs producers that  
**[0:51:35-0:51:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:51:35):**  have got energy and enthusiasm to keep hyping it as it were so we're gonna push all ourselves  
**[0:51:41-0:51:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:51:41):**  down that avenue I think which is a really nice model that I think could be adapted and  
**[0:51:46-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:51:46):**  you know people can collaborate and create their own version of it in other countries  
**[0:51:51-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:51:51):**  too it's very efficient yeah that's a very brilliant model that I think you know even  
**[0:51:56-0:52:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:51:56):**  if people can't replicate wherever they are can certainly take ideas from and use it to  
**[0:52:02-0:52:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:52:02):**  sort of inspire them to at least investigate what might work in their area now that we're  
**[0:52:08-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:52:08):**  on the the topic of kind of the business aspect of things I know for anyone paying attention  
**[0:52:13-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:52:13):**  to the entrepreneurial world they'll know that the common goal is to build your big  
**[0:52:18-0:52:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:52:18):**  your business as big as possible to maximize profits and market impact I know that you've  
**[0:52:23-0:52:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:52:23):**  been an outspo- an outspoken voice for moving away from this model and actually intensifying  
**[0:52:30-0:52:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:52:30):**  rather than growing your enterprises can you explain what the difference is and maybe give  
**[0:52:34-0:52:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:52:34):**  us an example well I think you know one of the key differences with some businesses and  
**[0:52:41-0:52:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:52:41):**  farming is that they're everything's observation base highly observation based big decisions  
**[0:52:50-0:52:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:52:50):**  are made on tiny observations at random times of day often that time of day I wake up two  
**[0:52:57-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:52:57):**  hours early and anyone else is when I see this thing that informs all of my next year's  
**[0:53:02-0:53:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:53:02):**  planning in a dramatic way and as you scale you lose that ability to maintain quality  
**[0:53:08-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:53:08):**  which you know is might not be the case if you're producing an electrical good or whatever  
**[0:53:15-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:53:15):**  but that's certainly the case with productions we need intimacy in management and the other  
**[0:53:21-0:53:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:53:21):**  thing is that it takes a lot of time to produce these things and so by scaling it doesn't  
**[0:53:27-0:53:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:53:27):**  necessarily make things more efficient it just requires more labor so you really have  
**[0:53:31-0:53:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:53:31):**  to scale according to the time that you can put into it and and the finances and planning  
**[0:53:40-0:53:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:53:40):**  behind all that is so critical and it's a big part of the work I do is helping people  
**[0:53:45-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:53:45):**  really look at inputs of time and money to get things to certain scales and it's something  
**[0:53:52-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:53:52):**  I want to write a little pamphlet about I'm hoping to do this winter because I see so  
**[0:53:58-0:54:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:53:58):**  many people coming into farming who haven't got farming in their blood or in their background  
**[0:54:05-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:54:05):**  find it very hard to find out what kind of enterprises are suitable to their landscape  
**[0:54:11-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:54:11):**  you know I've met people that want to set up micro dairies with eight cows on five hectares  
**[0:54:16-0:54:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:54:16):**  and there's just no way you can make a living now that and you know so that's part of my  
**[0:54:22-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:54:22):**  job is reality checking people and trying to match the numbers to the quality of life  
**[0:54:29-0:54:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:54:29):**  the money people want and the amount of time they've got and what we're trying to do in  
**[0:54:35-0:54:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:54:35):**  our farm now we're at the crossroads where we're entering our fifth season next year  
**[0:54:40-0:54:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:54:40):**  and we're looking to double the revenue from the farm which is already very good and very  
**[0:54:47-0:54:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:54:47):**  high but we're trying to bring in more long term people to the farm that will free up  
**[0:54:53-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:54:53):**  time for us to pursue other parts of our lives and to do that we're aiming to double revenues  
**[0:55:01-0:55:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:55:01):**  without growing the farm at all and our production numbers are you know anyone can find out about  
**[0:55:07-0:55:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:55:07):**  this stuff on our YouTube channel or whatever but they're they're very good and they're  
**[0:55:13-0:55:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:55:13):**  very good by European standards let alone this far north standards and I just see that  
**[0:55:18-0:55:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:55:18):**  you know I'm excited now about how to push ecosystem processes and see how far we can  
**[0:55:23-0:55:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:55:23):**  push them without becoming negative in our impact on the land and yeah that intensity  
**[0:55:32-0:55:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:55:32):**  is it's much easier to manage I mean our farm as I said is 10 hectares and I can keep my  
**[0:55:38-0:55:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:55:38):**  eye on everything going on pretty much all the time but I've met so many people that  
**[0:55:43-0:55:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:55:43):**  like ah we need some more revenue let's just make 50 more veg beds or you know let's just  
**[0:55:48-0:55:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:55:48):**  get more of that thing and it's yeah that's not the way I would approach farming it's  
**[0:55:54-0:56:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:55:54):**  very easy to spread yourself too thin and not be able to manage it well enough to keep  
**[0:56:00-0:56:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:56:00):**  ecosystem processes heading the way you want or keep the quality of your products more  
**[0:56:05-0:56:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:56:05):**  immediately up to the standards that your customers might be expecting and I just see  
**[0:56:12-0:56:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:56:12):**  that yeah there's many ways to improve like it basically it's by understanding ecosystem  
**[0:56:19-0:56:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:56:19):**  processes that we can really increase productions and some practical bits too you know something  
**[0:56:29-0:56:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:56:29):**  for example one thing we've been considering is whether to get a paper pot transplanted  
**[0:56:34-0:56:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:56:34):**  to radically improve efficiency of transplanting in the market guns and right now I've pulled  
**[0:56:41-0:56:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:56:41):**  back on that decision because I'm one of them be able to put on transplants which is way  
**[0:56:46-0:56:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:56:46):**  less efficient but it does allow me to grow much bigger plants and increase the number  
**[0:56:51-0:56:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:56:51):**  of rotations in our very short season which is of more value so if the time you know it's  
**[0:56:58-0:57:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:56:58):**  then it's a case of like well what extra time does it take me to pot things on and then  
**[0:57:02-0:57:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:57:02):**  transplant them manually compared to the time saved but the lower amount of crops I can  
**[0:57:08-0:57:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:57:08):**  grow with this faster tool and put that into a financial value and then I can actually  
**[0:57:14-0:57:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:57:14):**  make an informed decision you know and so we're really up on numbers and time and motion  
**[0:57:19-0:57:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:57:19):**  studies has been a major part of what we do which has led me to want to write this little  
**[0:57:25-0:57:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:57:25):**  pamphlet because I know all these things pretty intimately now that I think I could do a comparative  
**[0:57:31-0:57:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:57:31):**  study of all the different regenerative ag enterprises possible in relationship to scale  
**[0:57:39-0:57:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:57:39):**  and time inputs and money inputs and I think it would be really cool.  
**[0:57:44-0:57:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:57:44):**  It's an idea I've had all year and I'm hoping to sit down this winter and pen it.  
**[0:57:48-0:58:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:57:48):**  Brilliant, well definitely let me know when that pamphlet comes out I would love to take  
**[0:58:03-0:58:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:58:03):**  a look at it.  
**[0:58:04-0:58:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:58:04):**  I definitely agree with everything you just said there and it does require a lot more  
**[0:58:05-0:58:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:58:05):**  insight and a lot more observation which you know requires an effort on the part of the  
**[0:58:06-0:58:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:58:06):**  person managing it but I think you're definitely on the right path with you know priorities  
**[0:58:07-0:58:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:58:07):**  as to how to work those enterprises into something that really give you the outputs and the effect  
**[0:58:14-0:58:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:58:14):**  on the environment as well as you know the return and profit for yourself without just  
**[0:58:19-0:58:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:58:19):**  kind of lazily trying to make things bigger.  
**[0:58:22-0:58:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:58:22):**  Yeah, yeah it feels kind of sloppy and that's like an old business model in a way.  
**[0:58:27-0:58:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:58:27):**  I mean we sat down and got pretty clear what we're trying to go for in life and because  
**[0:58:33-0:58:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:58:33):**  we are producing our whole human diet here on the farm we don't actually need a lot.  
**[0:58:40-0:58:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:58:40):**  Our living costs a few thousand euros a year and we'll be out of debt within a year from  
**[0:58:45-0:58:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:58:45):**  now.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:58:46):**  We won't owe anything for the farm so we were clever not to get into debt to do this you  
**[0:58:51-0:58:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:58:51):**  know so if you can keep those input costs low then you don't need to produce so much  
**[0:58:56-0:59:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:58:56):**  you know so profitable and how much money is all relative and yeah there's no point  
**[0:59:02-0:59:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:59:02):**  like for us to grow the business much more we just need to be paying salaries which in  
**[0:59:07-0:59:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:59:07):**  Sweden you know you need 60, 70 thousand euros in the business just to pay the basic salaries  
**[0:59:14-0:59:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:59:14):**  so yeah it's a lot of product to make from a small farm.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:59:19):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:59:20-0:59:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:59:20):**  Now we already talked a little bit about the cash flow problem that a lot of farmers have  
**[0:59:25-0:59:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:59:25):**  and especially when starting out and also especially when they're working towards building  
**[0:59:30-0:59:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:59:30):**  a biodiverse model you know for any of the permaculture that's out there.  
**[0:59:34-0:59:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:59:34):**  So let's face it like trees and perennial systems take years or even decades to produce  
**[0:59:38-0:59:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:59:38):**  a return so how do you ensure that your farm is profitable while these long term systems  
**[0:59:44-0:59:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:59:44):**  are getting established and how do you sort of plan for them that far ahead?  
**[0:59:49-0:59:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:59:49):**  Well let's see you know I feel like it comes down to you know what our intentions and perspectives  
**[0:59:56-1:00:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=0:59:56):**  and long term goals are but for me I'm willing to front the cost of putting in agroforestry  
**[1:00:03-1:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:00:03):**  systems knowing that they're not paying back anytime soon because I'm choosing enterprises  
**[1:00:09-1:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:00:09):**  that support the rapid debt repayment and you know infrastructure developments of the  
**[1:00:16-1:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:00:16):**  farm so it's all been very carefully calculated and we set up with the intention to pay off  
**[1:00:22-1:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:00:22):**  all debts within five years and to do that we've chosen high return low startup enterprises  
**[1:00:28-1:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:00:28):**  and the most profitable of those all things considered is pastured boilers and pastured  
**[1:00:35-1:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:00:35):**  turkeys are even more profitable but there's not a big enough market to do that at scale.  
**[1:00:41-1:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:00:41):**  We do you know a few hundred birds but it's not enough to make significant revenue.  
**[1:00:46-1:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:00:46):**  It's not like a seasonal thing like where I come from where people will buy Christmas  
**[1:00:51-1:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:00:51):**  birds here they eat ham at Christmas.  
**[1:00:54-1:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:00:54):**  So we do some of those but then somewhat culturally specific.  
**[1:01:01-1:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:01:01):**  Yeah turkeys it's a much nicer bird to work with and way quicker to process because they're  
**[1:01:06-1:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:01:06):**  eight times the size and you know the time spent per kilo processed is much quicker but  
**[1:01:14-1:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:01:14):**  pastured boilers is a great one for allowing cash flow within the season but also very  
**[1:01:19-1:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:01:19):**  profitable you know to we set up what's one of Europe's cheapest slaughteries and paid  
**[1:01:26-1:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:01:26):**  that all off as well as all the infrastructure in the first year and it's so easy to scale  
**[1:01:31-1:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:01:31):**  that and then pastured laying birds very good it's not quite so profitable but it's a very  
**[1:01:38-1:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:01:38):**  nice enterprise for ecosystem processes I mean that's what's driven our grass regeneration  
**[1:01:46-1:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:01:46):**  and very profitable and then great one for building customer bases because people buy  
**[1:01:52-1:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:01:52):**  eggs so regularly you know people might eat 20 of our chickens in a year which means they  
**[1:01:57-1:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:01:57):**  might only see us twice but if they're buying eggs we see them either every two weeks or  
**[1:02:03-1:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:02:03):**  every four weeks we sell eggs in big volumes at a time just to reduce the selling but we're  
**[1:02:09-1:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:02:09):**  seeing those customers regularly so it's very easy to bolt on another product to them and  
**[1:02:14-1:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:02:14):**  then market gardens is the third so pastured layers pastured boilers and market guns are  
**[1:02:20-1:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:02:20):**  the three main enterprises and they all produce similar revenues but the market gardens take  
**[1:02:27-1:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:02:27):**  triple the time I mean that's a lot of human hours goes into that and then pastured pigs  
**[1:02:33-1:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:02:33):**  we do as a sideline it's it's quite profitable because we get all the spent grain from our  
**[1:02:39-1:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:02:39):**  local village brewery so our feed cost is very low and we raise heirloom pigs in the  
**[1:02:45-1:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:02:45):**  forest that so at a premium they're more like a wild boar in texture and color and I think  
**[1:02:52-1:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:02:52):**  the day we brought pigs to the farm people in Stockholm which is four hours drive away  
**[1:02:57-1:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:02:57):**  we're phoning up wanting to eat them so there's a big demand for that that's something we're  
**[1:03:02-1:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:03:02):**  continuing to scale and so all of those enterprises are things that pay themselves off immediately  
**[1:03:09-1:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:03:09):**  you know and have different startup costs I mean a lot of people wouldn't build their  
**[1:03:15-1:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:03:15):**  own slaughter facility I guess but it's it's actually surprisingly easy once you do it  
**[1:03:20-1:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:03:20):**  and not a big cost if you do that work yourself and setting up pastured laying hen operation  
**[1:03:26-1:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:03:26):**  is super low cost and market gardens was super low cost we had to install ponds and irrigation  
**[1:03:34-1:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:03:34):**  systems that spiked the cost compared to what a lot of people would but no cost startups  
**[1:03:40-1:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:03:40):**  you know how you take 20 grand and turn it into 60 grand in the first year and then grow  
**[1:03:46-1:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:03:46):**  it to 80 grand the next year and you know and these are models I think are all quite  
**[1:03:52-1:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:03:52):**  simple they're all approachable for people who don't come from farming backgrounds you  
**[1:03:58-1:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:03:58):**  know maybe market gardening is a bit more technical but you know all of them have their  
**[1:04:03-1:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:04:03):**  technicalities but I can train someone how to run those enterprises in one season including  
**[1:04:09-1:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:04:09):**  all the back end planning all the numbers all of everything and you know people that  
**[1:04:15-1:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:04:15):**  a lot of our teams that have been here over the years or course participants are going  
**[1:04:21-1:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:04:21):**  off and running with their models and and doing good so it's a really great time.  
**[1:04:26-1:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:04:26):**  Yeah definitely especially when you can see that other people are working with the models  
**[1:04:31-1:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:04:31):**  and the plans that you have and seeing that they're successful for them you definitely  
**[1:04:35-1:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:04:35):**  on to something that's kind of inherently true for others as well.  
**[1:04:38-1:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:04:38):**  So let's talk for a minute about the different ecosystem types that you encourage and care  
**[1:04:43-1:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:04:43):**  for on your land I know the biggest one being agroforestry and I know you also experiment  
**[1:04:49-1:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:04:49):**  a little with savannah landscapes on you know what's a very modest size farm and there are  
**[1:04:55-1:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:04:55):**  of course countless benefits for farmers in both of them but could you talk about just  
**[1:05:00-1:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:05:00):**  a few of the ways that they're misunderstood or mismanaged and how farmers can turn a regenerative  
**[1:05:05-1:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:05:05):**  profit from them.  
**[1:05:07-1:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:05:07):**  Yeah well I see that the tree systems need to work alongside other systems so integrating  
**[1:05:12-1:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:05:12):**  trees with either arable or pasture crops unless you're into monoculture forestry or  
**[1:05:18-1:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:05:18):**  monoculture orchiding which is not you know part of the regenerative ag picture in my  
**[1:05:23-1:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:05:23):**  mind.  
**[1:05:24-1:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:05:24):**  Right now we're talking about something different.  
**[1:05:28-1:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:05:28):**  Right for me the agroforestry you know integrating trees with pastoral systems there's so many  
**[1:05:37-1:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:05:37):**  misunderstandings in Europe with you know a lot of people value open landscapes and  
**[1:05:42-1:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:05:42):**  don't want to put trees in the open landscape but the nutrient cycling that's going on between  
**[1:05:48-1:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:05:48):**  trees and pastoral systems I've done a lot of research with silver pastures, silver arable  
**[1:05:53-1:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:05:53):**  systems around European climate zones and you get these beautiful interactions when  
**[1:05:59-1:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:05:59):**  you have tightly spaced laneways of trees with either pasture or arable crops in between  
**[1:06:06-1:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:06:06):**  including some of the leading European research showing that even plough agriculture can maintain  
**[1:06:12-1:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:06:12):**  carbon levels in the soil if the intensity of the tree plantings is high enough and here  
**[1:06:17-1:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:06:17):**  in Sweden where light is such a limiting factor in our short growing season I'm trying to  
**[1:06:23-1:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:06:23):**  just catch as many photons as I can whilst producing additional fruits and berries and  
**[1:06:29-1:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:06:29):**  nuts and shelter for the livestock that my cash flow enterprise is on the pasture in  
**[1:06:34-1:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:06:34):**  between and yeah we're playing with just standard orchard fruits you know apple pear, plum,  
**[1:06:41-1:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:06:41):**  cherry, hazels and berry fruits that all have high value and produce really high riboflavins  
**[1:06:47-1:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:06:47):**  and vitamin content due to the long sunlight hours here and yeah a lot of farmers have  
**[1:06:54-1:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:06:54):**  been quite interested in what we're doing because really putting trees, I've never been  
**[1:06:58-1:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:06:58):**  to a farm that's had too many trees and I think a lot of people are nervous to put them  
**[1:07:03-1:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:07:03):**  into their landscapes because they feel they'll get in the way but if they're designed well  
**[1:07:07-1:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:07:07):**  particularly in the sort of beautiful parallel systems that keyline design is based on then  
**[1:07:13-1:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:07:13):**  they're not in the way at all and the benefits by far outweigh any drawbacks but I'm also  
**[1:07:19-1:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:07:19):**  interested in some one of my pet projects is breeding nut trees I'm taking some of the  
**[1:07:24-1:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:07:24):**  hardiest nut trees genetics from around the world and just mass planting them and trying  
**[1:07:29-1:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:07:29):**  to find one of my life goals is to find castanha or the sweet chestnut that will give mature  
**[1:07:36-1:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:07:36):**  fruit in this short growing season and it might be a you know a life work that ends  
**[1:07:42-1:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:07:42):**  up failing but someone's got to do it because we need to find staple starch crops that don't  
**[1:07:48-1:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:07:48):**  require tillage in this climate and you know these are the remnants of the beautiful savannah  
**[1:07:54-1:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:07:54):**  systems where even today in the Iberian Peninsula in Europe you have some of the most expensive  
**[1:08:00-1:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:08:00):**  food on the planet is the Iberian black pig finished on acorns and chestnuts on open savannahs  
**[1:08:09-1:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:08:09):**  and you know this is for 450 euros a kilo and that's real nutrient dense food and so  
**[1:08:17-1:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:08:17):**  that's my little personal quest and it's partly on the back of like Sweden for context 95%  
**[1:08:23-1:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:08:23):**  of all trees in Sweden are spruce it's monocultural what I like to call vertical desert what people  
**[1:08:29-1:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:08:29):**  call forest in Sweden is not forest at all it's a monocultural spruce plantation or pine  
**[1:08:35-1:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:08:35):**  plantation so I'm interested in the alternatives that's a noble and very tasty goal yeah I  
**[1:08:43-1:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:08:43):**  mean chestnuts one of my favorite trees on the planet absolutely well we're doing we're  
**[1:08:48-1:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:08:48):**  doing two things with longer term perspective of forestry one is we're using pigs as ecosystem  
**[1:08:55-1:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:08:55):**  triggers to turn our monocultural spruce that we've inherited back to diverse forests and  
**[1:09:02-1:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:09:02):**  what's very interesting to me is that if you drive around Sweden there's nowhere that you  
**[1:09:07-1:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:09:07):**  see the native forest assembly because everyone's clear-cut and done pine or spruce plantation  
**[1:09:13-1:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:09:13):**  or perhaps birch for firewood and that's it that's the only three trees you see around  
**[1:09:18-1:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:09:18):**  yes unfortunately not very uncommon in many parts of the world no I guess not but here  
**[1:09:24-1:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:09:24):**  it's absolute I mean that's all that exists and so you cannot see you cannot see any area  
**[1:09:31-1:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:09:31):**  of natural forest and what happens when I take the pigs through the forest and the forest  
**[1:09:38-1:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:09:38):**  has been cut away is naturally the succession of native species that are all there in the  
**[1:09:44-1:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:09:44):**  seed bank it's coming back some of the best timbers that could grow here like oak and  
**[1:09:48-1:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:09:48):**  ash and lime and all the beautiful trees that I would like to you know leave to my kids  
**[1:09:55-1:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:09:55):**  so we're using pigs as an ecosystem trigger and and doing a natural Lubeck based forestry  
**[1:10:01-1:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:10:01):**  system where the input costs are zero and we use animals to generate profit for the  
**[1:10:07-1:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:10:07):**  70 80 90 years that the forest grows but then I'm also planting a lot of nut trees in savannah  
**[1:10:13-1:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:10:13):**  patterning over the top of what we call nut field on the farm but now I've started actually  
**[1:10:20-1:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:10:20):**  intensifying that and putting them into our key line silver pasture lanes as well as a  
**[1:10:27-1:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:10:27):**  long term over story that will one day replace those fruit trees because I'm very interested  
**[1:10:36-1:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:10:36):**  in savannah says optimal production systems in that in our climate where we are up to  
**[1:10:42-1:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:10:42):**  30% of the ground can be covered by mature nut or masking tree canopies without a single  
**[1:10:49-1:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:10:49):**  loss of pasture underneath and so therefore you get the best of both worlds and really  
**[1:10:55-1:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:10:55):**  optimal production systems capable of stocking really high density animals with a large storable  
**[1:11:03-1:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:11:03):**  starch or protein and oil crop above that also can be fed to animals if you can't be  
**[1:11:08-1:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:11:08):**  bothered to pick it up so that's a really long term vision I have that's you know I'm  
**[1:11:13-1:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:11:13):**  partly doing it because there's no agricultural institution or government that would pay for  
**[1:11:19-1:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:11:19):**  that kind of research and it's just going the opposite direction to modern agriculture  
**[1:11:25-1:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:11:25):**  but if I could leave a you know a single tree that's capable of producing chestnut to to  
**[1:11:32-1:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:11:32):**  Sweden then that would be my work complete I think absolutely that's a that's a fantastic  
**[1:11:38-1:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:11:38):**  goal and some really cool experiments that you're working with there I can't wait to  
**[1:11:42-1:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:11:42):**  hear more about them as the years come and I wish you all the best on that for sure now  
**[1:11:47-1:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:11:47):**  we've talked about a ton of you know the different enterprises that you have the planning that  
**[1:11:51-1:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:11:51):**  goes into it the market the business side and all of this complexity kind of leads me  
**[1:11:56-1:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:11:56):**  to my last question here and I know that one of the biggest challenges in the farming lifestyle  
**[1:12:01-1:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:12:01):**  especially is finding a way to balance all of the tasks that need to get done a social  
**[1:12:06-1:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:12:06):**  and a family life and tackling the never-ending chores on the business side of things so I'm  
**[1:12:12-1:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:12:12):**  curious to know if you've had any trouble with your own work-life balance and maybe  
**[1:12:17-1:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:12:17):**  some methods that you've used to get back on track yeah well it's a it was a pertinent  
**[1:12:22-1:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:12:22):**  question because yeah I think you know anyone running a diverse farm like this is busy and  
**[1:12:28-1:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:12:28):**  each year as I review my context the weak point is time time for family time for friends  
**[1:12:35-1:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:12:35):**  time for relationships and and each year I've done something to address that and this year  
**[1:12:41-1:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:12:41):**  I'm making quite radical adjustments to that because I've not just been running this farm  
**[1:12:47-1:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:12:47):**  I've also been you know hosting a lot of people here just for context for listeners who aren't  
**[1:12:54-1:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:12:54):**  so familiar with the farm I mean we knew that the first few we knew would be implementing  
**[1:12:58-1:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:12:58):**  this family rapidly and we knew that the educational opportunities from setting this up from scratch  
**[1:13:07-1:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:13:07):**  and and getting it up and running quickly were huge and we really want to leverage that  
**[1:13:12-1:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:13:12):**  because there's very few places in Europe where you can learn about holistic management  
**[1:13:17-1:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:13:17):**  and key line agroforestry and on-site processing and market gardening all in like one place  
**[1:13:24-1:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:13:24):**  that's happening in a visceral way right in front of your face so we wanted to leverage  
**[1:13:29-1:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:13:29):**  that and bring a lot of people here and make it open and available to people but that's  
**[1:13:33-1:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:13:33):**  required me you know full-time educating full-time farming full-time managing people which has  
**[1:13:40-1:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:13:40):**  been exhausting and I'm glad we've done it that way I think it's been amazing and we've  
**[1:13:45-1:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:13:45):**  been blessed to have amazing people here and and produced amazing results very fast but  
**[1:13:52-1:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:13:52):**  it's you know I think for most people sending out on a family farm like this you would want  
**[1:13:57-1:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:13:57):**  to spend 10-15 years doing what we've done in three or four and that's had implications  
**[1:14:04-1:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:14:04):**  I've you know got quite exhausted by the end of each season and and reviewing each yeah  
**[1:14:12-1:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:14:12):**  and I think this year it's just you know okay I'm not doing that again it doesn't need to  
**[1:14:17-1:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:14:17):**  be so intense now it's like we've set everything up and everything's functioning so now we  
**[1:14:23-1:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:14:23):**  move into a different gear where the people I want that come to the farm to learn I want  
**[1:14:28-1:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:14:28):**  them to learn more about now the how to maintain and perfect these systems because we're not  
**[1:14:36-1:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:14:36):**  installing we've done all of our major investments we have nothing else to build or do really  
**[1:14:42-1:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:14:42):**  except to perfect the systems we run and as we get older my partner's you know approaching  
**[1:14:49-1:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:14:49):**  40 and we've got a young baby and I have a daughter in the UK so it's quite hard to keep  
**[1:14:55-1:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:14:55):**  up family interactions and certainly in the middle of the growing season so we're making  
**[1:15:02-1:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:15:02):**  the big adjustment now to try and attract longer term people and you know make a more  
**[1:15:09-1:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:15:09):**  stable sort of rhythm to life because it is quite dramatic the seasons here requires long  
**[1:15:17-1:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:15:17):**  hours in the summer it's still light at 1130 at night and so someone's got to be awake  
**[1:15:21-1:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:15:21):**  and put the chickens away and that's the way it is not really we have we have a sheepdog  
**[1:15:31-1:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:15:31):**  who's pretty useless with sheep but she is very good at putting chickens to sleep so  
**[1:15:36-1:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:15:36):**  that's helpful but it's but we do long hours in the summer I think any one working on the  
**[1:15:41-1:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:15:41):**  land here would work very long hours in the summer just because it's so light it's natural  
**[1:15:46-1:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:15:46):**  to sir and then you shrink back in the winter but but that's we're at this you know we're  
**[1:15:52-1:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:15:52):**  actually set at the farm right now with three weeks left of planning to to come up with  
**[1:15:57-1:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:15:57):**  a new business structure and it's something I'm quite excited about because it's the reason  
**[1:16:02-1:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:16:02):**  this is coming about is to create more time for myself and time for family essentially  
**[1:16:11-1:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:16:11):**  and time away from the farm too because it's you know it's something that's a lot of people  
**[1:16:16-1:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:16:16):**  coming here to learn get a real reality check with is like hey it's seven days a week 365  
**[1:16:24-1:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:16:24):**  days a year if you have livestock it's you know it's not summers finished or gardens  
**[1:16:30-1:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:16:30):**  are packed up and we don't do anything for the winters like things need looking after  
**[1:16:34-1:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:16:34):**  all winter and it gets down to minus 30 minus 35 here so it's can be tough looking after  
**[1:16:40-1:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:16:40):**  stuff in the winter because there's things freezing up and can't get out of the doorway  
**[1:16:46-1:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:16:46):**  you know so it's yeah it's we're settling into a different rhythm and and trying to  
**[1:16:52-1:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:16:52):**  find ways to keep growing the business by growing its intensity whilst creating more  
**[1:16:57-1:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:16:57):**  time and you know increasing the revenue to have other people join this longer term and  
**[1:17:05-1:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:17:05):**  so it's an interesting dynamic you know it's quite a different challenge I guess than a  
**[1:17:10-1:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:17:10):**  lot of businesses would have but it's fun that's the systems bit of it that I love to  
**[1:17:15-1:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:17:15):**  do and and I think we're going to produce some nice results and next season will be  
**[1:17:19-1:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:17:19):**  very different from it so be very few people here and we're going to optimize I'd say most  
**[1:17:26-1:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:17:26):**  of our enterprises are pretty optimized but we're looking to just shave time off everything  
**[1:17:32-1:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:17:32):**  every operation at the farm to we've been joking about 40 hour working week you know  
**[1:17:38-1:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:17:38):**  which I think is unrealistic on the farm like this but I think it can be below 60 which  
**[1:17:45-1:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:17:45):**  is for me would be huge I think you know that is yeah that is huge for me it's huge because  
**[1:17:51-1:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:17:51):**  it's I you know some of the people here are putting in very long hours with me and certainly  
**[1:17:58-1:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:17:58):**  so that my closer aides as it were but the you know I will then come in at night and  
**[1:18:05-1:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:18:05):**  and run all my other business outside the farm and make videos for YouTube and all this  
**[1:18:10-1:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:18:10):**  other stuff so it's it's been a bit too much you know I feel like hey I need to look after  
**[1:18:15-1:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:18:15):**  myself and not I'm passionate to put stuff out there and share it but I need to to get  
**[1:18:21-1:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:18:21):**  that balance so I think it's a really familiar thing for anyone you know anyone even just  
**[1:18:26-1:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:18:26):**  having a 2,000 square meter market garden you'll always feel like there's things you  
**[1:18:31-1:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:18:31):**  wish you could fit in a day and certainly I can relate to that with the different jobs  
**[1:18:35-1:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:18:35):**  I've had too yeah I mean now that we're setting up our farm things are you know really dragging  
**[1:18:40-1:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:18:40):**  out in a day and you just realize okay we have the same amount of time as everybody  
**[1:18:46-1:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:18:46):**  else and we have to make some sort of realistic limits on what we can do while still maintaining  
**[1:18:51-1:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:18:51):**  our own health yeah yeah that's the thing like if your health is getting affected then  
**[1:18:56-1:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:18:56):**  like I got a point this year where you know I got I started getting exhaustion before  
**[1:19:02-1:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:19:02):**  the end of the season and that was like okay this isn't you know this is not benefiting  
**[1:19:08-1:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:19:08):**  me it's I've got to change the way it's got a benefit everyone here but it's definitely  
**[1:19:14-1:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:19:14):**  got to benefit me and it's I've been extending myself too much these years to try and share  
**[1:19:20-1:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:19:20):**  this with a lot of people and it's been amazing but I'm reeling it back in now and that feels  
**[1:19:28-1:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:19:28):**  really good and yeah I think it's it's good to be real about that and to keep revisiting  
**[1:19:34-1:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:19:34):**  context because it's you know it's easy to push yourself too far and I think it's good  
**[1:19:41-1:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:19:41):**  to have people around that can check you and say hey you know yeah no that's a great perspective  
**[1:19:47-1:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:19:47):**  it's really well said now before I let you go here I know that you have a new online  
**[1:19:52-1:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:19:52):**  course for aspiring regenerative farmers could you tell me a bit about your new course and  
**[1:19:57-1:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:19:57):**  what it offers to students yeah well let's come about from that's part of this redesign  
**[1:20:03-1:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:20:03):**  of our context it's partly to give me more time we've been having very intensive internships  
**[1:20:10-1:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:20:10):**  for several months where I'm you know freely available to 10 at night for people and trying  
**[1:20:17-1:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:20:17):**  to get people going with this stuff I think it's been important that a lot of people come  
**[1:20:23-1:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:20:23):**  to the farm and get engaged with their senses but something I've noticed with education  
**[1:20:27-1:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:20:27):**  is it takes a long time to synthesize certain things you know doing holistic management  
**[1:20:33-1:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:20:33):**  trainings here it takes people weeks just to start polishing their holistic context  
**[1:20:38-1:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:20:38):**  for themselves so I decided I wanted to put all our education online now and be able to  
**[1:20:45-1:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:20:45):**  mentor people over several months so it's had different iterations we've been building  
**[1:20:51-1:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:20:51):**  it for over a year now and it's kind of you know it's like the same no-nonsense approach  
**[1:20:58-1:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:20:58):**  we have in our book and YouTube channel is not super fancy you know filming and animations  
**[1:21:07-1:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:21:07):**  is it's nice quality but it's straight to the point and clear and it's information based  
**[1:21:11-1:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:21:11):**  and the idea is it replaces the need to come here we were also responding to a lot of requests  
**[1:21:18-1:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:21:18):**  like people who would love to come here just can't take the time off or can't travel this  
**[1:21:24-1:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:21:24):**  far and so it's come about for many reasons but the the way we've produced it is it's  
**[1:21:31-1:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:21:31):**  like you having a big tour with me around the farm looking at every detail of everything  
**[1:21:37-1:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:21:37):**  so it's like a 50-hour tour of everything we think about and do in reality also a lot  
**[1:21:45-1:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:21:45):**  of lectures and you know the thinking behind regenerative agricultural design and you know  
**[1:21:51-1:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:21:51):**  I've done a lot of design work in the past so it goes into a lot of that and it's divided  
**[1:21:56-1:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:21:56):**  into chapters based on the scale of permanence and similar to our books to lead people through  
**[1:22:02-1:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:22:02):**  a step-by-step process of like designing farms for themselves and I'm quick to point out  
**[1:22:10-1:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:22:10):**  it's not you know I've seen a lot of online courses coming out recently and I'm not out  
**[1:22:17-1:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:22:17):**  to try and cram lots of people into it I'm not trying to like hook people into it I'm  
**[1:22:23-1:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:22:23):**  not doing any aggressive marketing of it it's like hey this is something we're offering  
**[1:22:27-1:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:22:27):**  if if you look carefully through it and think it's good for you then go for it and if you're  
**[1:22:32-1:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:22:32):**  not sure then don't do it because yeah I'm not into that kind of thing I've seen it too  
**[1:22:38-1:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:22:38):**  much and it's not where we're at with business or life so it's for people that wish that  
**[1:22:44-1:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:22:44):**  they could be here wish that they could get the back-end knowledge of planning spreadsheets  
**[1:22:51-1:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:22:51):**  and HACC plans for building slaughteries and you know and just like have someone who knows  
**[1:22:59-1:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:22:59):**  a good deal about this stuff poke them that's one of my main skills is like giving people  
**[1:23:05-1:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:23:05):**  a kick up the ass really you know it's like hey did you do that hey check out that spreadsheet  
**[1:23:09-1:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:23:09):**  did you know I'm drilling people always with the back-end like get your spreadsheets in  
**[1:23:14-1:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:23:14):**  order and because that's the weakest bits like the financial planning and decision-making  
**[1:23:19-1:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:23:19):**  that's where everyone doesn't put enough time or messes up and the other bits designing  
**[1:23:24-1:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:23:24):**  it's quite easy easy to design landscapes it's very hard to make business work in reality  
**[1:23:30-1:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:23:30):**  because most people are coming into this and new to farming and then you to running a business  
**[1:23:35-1:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:23:35):**  and that's a recipe for heartache and divorce and bankruptcy so I can I can definitely confirm  
**[1:23:42-1:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:23:42):**  that with the different clients that I've worked with as well as a designer consultant  
**[1:23:46-1:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:23:46):**  so yeah the business side is what everybody overlooks and they think that they can just  
**[1:23:51-1:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:23:51):**  kind of gloss over and things will work I'm really glad people like you are putting out  
**[1:23:55-1:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:23:55):**  resources like this and courses that help people walk through that that part that is  
**[1:24:01-1:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:24:01):**  usually not included in well it's not even touched on for the most part in the permaculture  
**[1:24:05-1:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:24:05):**  design courses and most agricultural or at least you know progressive agricultural education  
**[1:24:14-1:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:24:14):**  so yeah it's totally fundamental so we've done to just to summarize what we put out  
**[1:24:20-1:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:24:20):**  is two different trainings one is for people that just want information and they can go  
**[1:24:25-1:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:24:25):**  through it it's they're both lifetime access but one of them is totally self-led you can't  
**[1:24:30-1:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:24:30):**  email me your questions you can't get in touch with me you just take all this information  
**[1:24:35-1:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:24:35):**  and if you feel like it's going to be useful you can use it and keep hold of it for as  
**[1:24:40-1:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:24:40):**  long as you like and the other one is a scheduled program so that the self-led one is being  
**[1:24:47-1:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:24:47):**  launched 20th of November and then it's just available whenever people want and then there's  
**[1:24:52-1:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:24:52):**  some scheduled training running mid-january to April where each week we'll be doing webinars  
**[1:24:59-1:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:24:59):**  and then I'll be giving people direct personal feedback on tasks that they have throughout  
**[1:25:05-1:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:25:05):**  the training so hey you've got to go make your layer spreadsheet and then I'm going  
**[1:25:11-1:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:25:11):**  to rip it apart and find all the holes in it so we give templates and guides and then  
**[1:25:17-1:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:25:17):**  I'm going to you know pushing people that show up and put the time in I'm going to push  
**[1:25:23-1:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:25:23):**  them as far as they want to go so excellent that's exciting and I'm looking forward to  
**[1:25:27-1:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:25:27):**  that that sounds wonderful as soon as I free up a little bit of time in my schedule I might  
**[1:25:32-1:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:25:32):**  be one of your students that sounds like a great course well where else can people or  
**[1:25:38-1:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:25:38):**  where can our listeners go to find more of your online resources I know you've got the  
**[1:25:42-1:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:25:42):**  book making small farms work and how can they get in contact with you and there's well we  
**[1:25:49-1:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:25:49):**  have various things online farm websites with permaculture.com and then we sell our book  
**[1:25:56-1:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:25:56):**  and ebook and via making small farms work dot info I believe this and then we have a  
**[1:26:03-1:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:26:03):**  YouTube channel it's growing and I try and just have a really sort of you know candid  
**[1:26:08-1:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:26:08):**  camera approach to life on the farm and it's you know it's me walking around showing you  
**[1:26:14-1:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:26:14):**  what we're doing why we're doing it talking about different things you know trying to  
**[1:26:18-1:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:26:18):**  give people an inside view onto the farm it's it's some people really appreciate it we have  
**[1:26:25-1:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:26:25):**  amazing followers who actually watch all our videos and we're not playing the YouTube game  
**[1:26:30-1:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:26:30):**  we're just trying to document stuff and put it out there in different mediums so people  
**[1:26:34-1:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:26:34):**  can take it or leave it and that's a good place for people to find out more really you  
**[1:26:39-1:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:26:39):**  can watch the whole of the season and it was different topics from animals to vegetables  
**[1:26:45-1:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:26:45):**  to business and showing you numbers and getting into the thinking behind some of this stuff  
**[1:26:50-1:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:26:50):**  so that's a good place to start.  
**[1:26:53-1:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:26:53):**  You can definitely count me in that crowd I think I've probably seen all of your videos  
**[1:26:56-1:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:26:56):**  by now and you're far too modest talking about like you just walk around the farm and show  
**[1:27:00-1:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:27:00):**  people what's going on there surprisingly in depth that some of the best resources that  
**[1:27:04-1:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:27:04):**  I found in video form that are actually available for free so great job with that.

**[1:27:48-1:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:27:48):**  projects.  
**[1:27:49-1:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:27:49):**  Cheers.  
**[1:27:50-1:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:27:50):**  All right you have a good day.  
**[1:27:53-1:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:27:53):**  So before we wrap up this show for the week I've got some exciting news about the upcoming  
**[1:27:56-1:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:27:56):**  months and I'm joined here now with my good friend and founder of Atitlán Organics Shad  
**[1:28:01-1:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:28:01):**  Goodsy.  
**[1:28:02-1:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:28:02):**  Hey buddy what's new?  
**[1:28:03-1:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:28:03):**  Oh man so much is happening.  
**[1:28:06-1:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:28:06):**  First off though I just want to say thanks for having me man I really love your podcast  
**[1:28:10-1:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:28:10):**  and I actually had a great time doing that interview back in one of the earlier episodes.  
**[1:28:14-1:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:28:14):**  Anyway probably what's most exciting is our new collaboration between Atitlán Organics  
**[1:28:19-1:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:28:19):**  and Abundant Edge.  
**[1:28:21-1:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:28:21):**  As you know we've been offering permaculture design courses for over six years now and  
**[1:28:25-1:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:28:25):**  they really have become a staple here in Lake Atitlán.  
**[1:28:29-1:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:28:29):**  In particular though the intro to permaculture course is just an amazing way for travelers,  
**[1:28:34-1:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:28:34):**  gardeners, architects, basically anyone to fully immerse themselves in this new paradigm  
**[1:28:40-1:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:28:40):**  of permaculture design.  
**[1:28:42-1:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:28:42):**  Like honestly you can't take this course and still see the world the same way afterward.  
**[1:28:47-1:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:28:47):**  Yeah that's for sure.  
**[1:28:48-1:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:28:48):**  It's life changing.  
**[1:28:49-1:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:28:49):**  But like I said what I'm most excited about is that now thanks to our collaboration we're  
**[1:28:55-1:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:28:55):**  going to be able to offer your natural building course immediately after every one of our  
**[1:29:00-1:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:29:00):**  intro to permaculture courses.  
**[1:29:02-1:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:29:02):**  Literally this two week offering is like possibly the most complete package that I know of available  
**[1:29:09-1:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:29:09):**  anywhere.  
**[1:29:10-1:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:29:10):**  Basically with these two courses alone I think that someone should have everything they need  
**[1:29:15-1:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:29:15):**  to start their own regenerative project or just their own regenerative lifestyle.  
**[1:29:20-1:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:29:20):**  That's what I'm excited about man.  
**[1:29:21-1:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:29:21):**  But yeah what about you?  
**[1:29:23-1:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:29:23):**  What's going on?  
**[1:29:24-1:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:29:24):**  Man well you know already that me and the abundant edge team are gearing up for a big  
**[1:29:28-1:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:29:28):**  season as well.  
**[1:29:29-1:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:29:29):**  I mean starting in November we'll be breaking ground on a regenerative farming demonstration  
**[1:29:34-1:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:29:34):**  site which is of course right down the hill from your farm.  
**[1:29:37-1:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:29:37):**  We'll be building animal pens, a classroom, outdoor kitchens and lounge areas connected  
**[1:29:42-1:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:29:42):**  to houses and it's all going to be made out of natural materials.  
**[1:29:46-1:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:29:46):**  I mean the site is going to serve as a demonstration farm for perennial and regenerative farming  
**[1:29:51-1:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:29:51):**  methods for years and years to come and we'll even be offering courses and internship opportunities  
**[1:29:56-1:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:29:56):**  to people who want to learn for themselves about how to build with natural materials  
**[1:30:00-1:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:30:00):**  and set up their own farms.  
**[1:30:03-1:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:30:03):**  Heck yeah!  
**[1:30:04-1:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:30:04):**  That sounds amazing man.  
**[1:30:05-1:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:30:05):**  And honestly this is just about the best place in the world to learn all these things too.  
**[1:30:09-1:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:30:09):**  I mean this little town is Sununah in the gorgeous tropical mountains of Guatemala like  
**[1:30:14-1:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:30:14):**  right here on the shores of Lake Atitlan.  
**[1:30:16-1:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:30:16):**  It's one of the most beautiful places in the world.  
**[1:30:19-1:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:30:19):**  On top of that you have this traditional indigenous Mayan culture that's still rich and alive  
**[1:30:24-1:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:30:24):**  and probably my favorite part is that we have this world international community of alternative  
**[1:30:30-1:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:30:30):**  people that are open to new ideas and really putting things into practice.  
**[1:30:35-1:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:30:35):**  I mean within walking distance of the bamboo guest house you've got loads of things going  
**[1:30:39-1:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:30:39):**  on.  
**[1:30:40-1:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:30:40):**  We've got the projects that we've already talked about but you also have yoga retreat  
**[1:30:44-1:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:30:44):**  centers.  
**[1:30:45-1:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:30:45):**  You have Charlie Rendell's natural bamboo building school.  
**[1:30:48-1:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:30:48):**  You have Love Probiotics.  
**[1:30:49-1:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:30:49):**  You've got Fungi Academy and honestly loads more alternative blow your mind type stuff.  
**[1:30:55-1:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:30:55):**  I honestly just feel like this is where it's all happening.  
**[1:30:58-1:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:30:58):**  Yeah man it really does and I want to get as many people as possible in on these projects  
**[1:31:02-1:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:31:02):**  but we've got to make sure that they've got the skills first.  
**[1:31:05-1:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:31:05):**  So what do you say?  
**[1:31:06-1:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:31:06):**  Let's offer a big discount to those who sign up for both courses.  
**[1:31:09-1:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:31:09):**  I mean all food and lodging and the amazing bamboo guest house is already included in  
**[1:31:13-1:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:31:13):**  the tuition so this will be like the best deal that we've ever offered.  
**[1:31:17-1:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:31:17):**  That's a great idea because I mean people can still take just one course if that's what  
**[1:31:21-1:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:31:21):**  they're into or if they can't make the full two weeks but this will actually make the  
**[1:31:25-1:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:31:25):**  two courses more accessible to even a wider audience of people.  
**[1:31:29-1:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:31:29):**  That way more people can get the knowledge that they need to get started doing what they  
**[1:31:34-1:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:31:34):**  want to do.  
**[1:31:35-1:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-richard-perkins-042/#t=1:31:35):**  So hey to all of you listening out there we really want passionate and driven people like

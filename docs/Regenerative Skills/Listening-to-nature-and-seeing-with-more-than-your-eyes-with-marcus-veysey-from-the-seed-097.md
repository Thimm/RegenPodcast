**[0:02:03-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:02:03):**  Welcome to the first episode of season 3.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:02:06):**  I'm so excited for the year to come and all the conversations, interviews, and information  
**[0:02:10-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:02:10):**  that I'll be sharing with all of you over the year.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:02:12):**  This season, while I'll still be sticking with the general format of the season prior,  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:02:16):**  I'm also looking to bring more stories into these conversations and cultivate narratives  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:02:20):**  around the incredible work that people around the world are doing in the regenerative fields.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:02:25):**  Just like last season, once a month the team from Abundant Edge will be checking in on  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:02:29):**  the regenerative roundtable segments and giving updates on the design and development of the  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:02:33):**  farm as well as the projects we're working on for clients and friends both in our communities  
**[0:02:38-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:02:38):**  and around the world.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:02:40):**  Now today's guest is a good friend of mine from our community here in Sununna on Lake  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:02:44):**  Atitlan in Guatemala.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:02:47):**  Marcus Vesey has lived and worked here at the lake for over 25 years and is a wealth  
**[0:02:51-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:02:51):**  of knowledge on medicinal plants and herbs.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:02:54):**  Now rather than focusing just on plant medicines, our conversation focuses more on how to listen  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:02:59):**  and observe the natural environment around you and open your heart and perspective to  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:03:03):**  what the plants you interact with are really communicating to you.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:03:07):**  Through mindfulness practices and small but profound changes in your habits and perspective,  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:03:11):**  Marcus guides us through his own journey of discovery and learning from the local ecology  
**[0:03:16-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:03:16):**  and communities here in Guatemala.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:03:18):**  I thought this would be the perfect conversation to launch the new season of this podcast with  
**[0:03:22-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:03:22):**  the intention of connecting the practical information of regenerative living to the  
**[0:03:26-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:03:26):**  stories and narratives of the people and their lifestyles.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:03:29):**  So I hope you enjoy this chat with my good friend Marcus.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:03:33):**  Now before we get started I'll just warn you that though the ambient sound from the deck  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:03:36):**  at Marcus's place is full of songbirds, there are also some distracting sounds from the  
**[0:03:40-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:03:40):**  fireworks and the dishwashing, so bear with me a little.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:03:43):**  I wasn't able to capture the ambient garden sounds without also getting some of the side  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:03:47):**  noise as well.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:03:49):**  So now I'll turn things over to Marcus.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:03:51):**  Hey Marcus, thanks so much for having me here.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:03:54):**  It's such a pleasure always to come to your place.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:03:56):**  You hold remarkable space.  
**[0:03:57-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:03:57):**  We've got a little bit of incense going.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:03:59):**  There's a crystal in the center.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:04:01):**  There's a candle.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:04:02):**  Before we get started, tell me a little bit about the significance of putting these out.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:04:07):**  Well, I've been taught a bunch of ritualistic practices maybe or just exercises of meditation  
**[0:04:18-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:04:18):**  which are more connected to what would be Western occultism.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:04:26):**  There is the four elements which describes different aspects of life.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:04:31):**  And so whenever I do something that I class as slightly special, I'll get the four elements  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:04:37):**  out just to help bring in the conscious awareness that there's an interaction on all levels.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:04:44):**  I love it.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:04:45):**  Yeah, I've been working to reintroduce a certain element of ceremony and of aspects like this  
**[0:04:53-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:04:53):**  in even more mundane parts of my life to give some significance and to cause for reflection.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:04:59):**  I like the way that you do this.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:05:01):**  But rather than focus too much on this, let's get started a little bit because there's a  
**[0:05:06-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:05:06):**  lot of questions that I'd love to ask you.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:05:07):**  But let's start with a little bit about your background.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:05:09):**  How did you get to be here living in rural Guatemala?  
**[0:05:13-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:05:13):**  Well, I came about 25 years ago just traveling around looking for nice experiences and nice  
**[0:05:25-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:05:25):**  places which turned into looking for myself, which turned into meditation and yoga.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:05:31):**  And I ended up in a meditation center here for 20 years.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:05:35):**  I studied, learned and taught yoga, meditation, metaphysics and plant medicine.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:05:42):**  Well, this is fantastic because the main reason why I'm here is to talk to you a little bit  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:05:47):**  about the way that you observe and connect with nature on a deeper level and how that's  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:05:52):**  affected the way that you manage your garden, the whole ecosystem around your living space  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:05:58):**  and how that permeates into other aspects of your life.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:06:02):**  So before we go into the depth and the details of observation on other levels and listening  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:06:09):**  to the ecology around us, tell me a little bit about how you've curated the gardens and  
**[0:06:14-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:06:14):**  the space around here and how your observations of what was here to begin with informed that.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:06:22):**  Just to be clear on the question, you want to know why and how what I've learned has  
**[0:06:27-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:06:27):**  influenced my garden here?  
**[0:06:29-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:06:29):**  Yeah, sorry.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:06:30):**  I know I didn't ask very complex open-ended questions.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:06:35):**  Just tell me all the things all at once.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:06:38):**  You've specialized mostly in medicinal plants, but also there's many other aspects, both  
**[0:06:44-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:06:44):**  practical and food protection shade and a lot of very beautiful plants almost purely  
**[0:06:52-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:06:52):**  for aesthetics as well.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:06:53):**  You have a very well-balanced ecosystem here.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:06:56):**  Yeah, that's thanks to my wife as much as me, to be quite honest, although she doesn't  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:07:03):**  put her hands in the garden ever.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:07:07):**  I was given a medicinal garden to look after, which didn't have very many medicinal plants  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:07:13):**  in it, but it was a space and it had some medicinal herbs in it.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:07:18):**  And I was given a whole bunch of books to study about medicinal plants.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:07:24):**  And that was 25 years ago when I first arrived here.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:07:29):**  And I was given a bunch of notes from two doctors that studied from these notes and  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:07:36):**  books and given them to me.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:07:40):**  I was interested and I started studying and understanding more about plants.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:07:48):**  This was in the days pre-internet, so you can Google anything.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:07:51):**  We didn't even have electricity back in those days.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:07:54):**  You're making yourself sound so much older than you are.  
**[0:07:57-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:07:57):**  It's just here in this part of Guatemala.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:07:59):**  Yeah, I'm really very young.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:08:08):**  I didn't have much of an ability to learn from a teacher on a formal level or teaching  
**[0:08:15-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:08:15):**  some of the people on a formal level.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:08:17):**  So I was kind of stuck in the garden trying to make everything up and what we call wing  
**[0:08:21-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:08:21):**  it as much as possible.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:08:24):**  It's in my nature, I think, to do so.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:08:26):**  So I like that type of winging challenge, if you like, but I made a lot of mistakes  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:08:30):**  in that process, lots of trial and error in understanding how herbs and plants work.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:08:36):**  And I was forced to learn maybe the basics of interaction with plants in a more intuitive  
**[0:08:46-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:08:46):**  way, where if I didn't listen and figure things out and just sit down and ask, then  
**[0:08:55-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:08:55):**  there wasn't anybody around to tell me anyway.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:08:56):**  I had some great experts and professionals that gave me wonderful, you know, half a day  
**[0:09:05-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:09:05):**  teachings and sharing some of their wisdom here and there, which was great.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:09:13):**  But the fact that I was mostly self-taught all the way through my experience with plants  
**[0:09:18-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:09:18):**  meant that I didn't have a very structured idea of how to work with plants from the beginning.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:09:29):**  It was a kind of a common sense, tap into your own intuition and listen type experience.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:09:36):**  So I learned to pay attention to what was going on and some things I would figure out  
**[0:09:44-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:09:44):**  logically through simple trial and error.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:09:48):**  But somewhere down the line, I started, I realized that one of the most important or  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:09:55):**  most effective ways to actually do work in a garden that I was looking after was not  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:10:01):**  to have a preconceived idea of what work you needed to do, but just to go in with an open  
**[0:10:05-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:10:05):**  mind, listen to what the garden had to tell you and do any odd job that popped in there  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:10:10):**  as you were wandering around the garden barefoot.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:10:13):**  We had the luxury to do that barefoot because of the climate here.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:10:21):**  And so I started doing that more and more and more and more and I started having all  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:10:26):**  sorts of ideas about what plants need to be done and there was this plant over there that  
**[0:10:31-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:10:31):**  needed to have this and those over there that needed to have that.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:10:35):**  These are things that I would never have been able to realize if I wanted to plan ahead  
**[0:10:43-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:10:43):**  or anything like that.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:10:45):**  Because I didn't really know much from the beginning, I had to listen.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:10:47):**  I had to listen a lot and I had to pay attention a lot.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:10:51):**  I had to really observe and learn through observation a lot of the time.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:10:56):**  But one thing that I didn't figure out to begin with that I figure out later on down  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:11:01):**  the line was the plants were actually sharing a lot more understanding and wisdom with me  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:11:07):**  than I was realizing.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:11:09):**  And I was figuring things out a lot faster than I should have done for my level of understanding  
**[0:11:15-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:11:15):**  and learning.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:11:16):**  So I was figuring things out a lot quicker.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:11:20):**  Because I was listening to plants, my ego put it down to my own self-importance and  
**[0:11:24-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:11:24):**  intelligence and how clever I am.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:11:26):**  But years down the line I realized that it wasn't me being clever so much as it was me  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:11:31):**  actually learning to listen to nature and my thoughts were…  
**[0:11:37-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:11:37):**  I learned to put my mind in a frame where I could be open to be influenced if you like  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:11:44):**  by the energetics of the garden and the plants that were in them.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:11:49):**  Now this is one of the reasons why I've always enjoyed coming around and talking to  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:11:53):**  you and spending time with you is because you have a perception and a way of looking  
**[0:11:58-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:11:58):**  at ecology that doesn't come easy to someone like me.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:12:01):**  I'm very left-brained.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:12:03):**  I really like to solve problems by learning everything I can about them, dissecting them  
**[0:12:08-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:12:08):**  logically.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:12:09):**  And I struggle, though I know the importance of turning some of that off and just observing,  
**[0:12:16-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:12:16):**  being open to listen.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:12:19):**  What sort of advice do you have for other people with my personality disposition to  
**[0:12:26-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:12:26):**  let go of some of that inner chatter and that directive to always try and solve problems  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:12:32):**  or even to come into a situation with preconceived notions and observations?  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:12:37):**  What's some of the way that you help to turn that off and be more open?  
**[0:12:43-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:12:43):**  You have to be in your space or your least awareness that, hey, my intellect can serve  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:12:53):**  me wonderfully and I can rationally figure out all sorts of great stuff but it's quite  
**[0:12:59-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:12:59):**  limited at the same time.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:13:01):**  Or it doesn't get me everywhere.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:13:04):**  I know there's more than just this intellectual me.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:13:08):**  When you were talking earlier about plants being able to communicate on different levels  
**[0:13:12-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:13:12):**  energetically and how they affect not just the soil composition or the amount of oxygen  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:13:20):**  in the space and all of these things that we can measure but rather there are other  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:13:24):**  interactions that can be hard to observe without being open to it.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:13:29):**  I think in order to talk about it we have to first maybe knock on the idea that in this  
**[0:13:38-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:13:38):**  life that we experience there is more going on in front of our faces than we are able  
**[0:13:48-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:13:48):**  to perceive or measure or calculate with some instruments and things like this.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:13:55):**  It's not always where we want to, we are very attached to the physical reality that this  
**[0:14:00-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:14:00):**  world is and we are very attached to our bodies and we identify very strongly with the skin  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:14:07):**  and bone we call ourselves.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:14:11):**  We know very little about consciousness or the awareness which is inhabiting this skin  
**[0:14:16-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:14:16):**  and bone flesh vehicle that we're in.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:14:20):**  But at the same time we identify most strongly with that.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:14:22):**  So this is the realm in which we experience most of life consciously is in the material  
**[0:14:28-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:14:28):**  realm.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:14:29):**  Now I was taught over the years that there's much more to this and these are all maybe  
**[0:14:33-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:14:33):**  more what you might call spiritual belief systems or ideas which don't necessarily belong  
**[0:14:40-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:14:40):**  to any religious beliefs but can be seen as speaking about different levels of consciousness,  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:14:50):**  different levels of existence that we're not really able to perceive or understand very  
**[0:14:56-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:14:56):**  fully because our perception is trapped if you like in a more mundane material world.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:15:02):**  That's where we are.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:15:04):**  Our intellect is something which connects very strongly to this physical world but it  
**[0:15:13-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:15:13):**  can be seen as or mind and mental vibration can be seen as an energetic which reaches  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:15:22):**  out beyond the limitations of your physical skin just like the electromagnetic vibrations  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:15:27):**  which bounce out of your body into the world.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:15:30):**  They're very difficult to measure past a certain point, very difficult to see but we will be  
**[0:15:36-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:15:36):**  feeling them in some way.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:15:37):**  We'll be receiving that vibration whether you want to call it an emotional one, a mental  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:15:42):**  one, a spiritual one.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:15:47):**  These are the other three elements which are represented as different levels of consciousness  
**[0:15:53-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:15:53):**  and different levels of understanding which is all called spiritual in some way because  
**[0:16:00-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:16:00):**  it's not physical in nature.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:16:02):**  I got taught a lot about different dimensional realities and astral realities and different  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:16:11):**  dimensional truths and I did a lot of practices in order to experience what actually meant  
**[0:16:17-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:16:17):**  and so I gained a different level of experience of what non-physical energy is.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:16:24):**  This I was always all doing while learning about plants and gardening at the same time.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:16:29):**  My experience was a little bit different but it did take me a long time to figure out some  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:16:35):**  of the very simple basics because I think my mind was quite stubborn and not very open  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:16:40):**  to actually seeing what is now quite obvious.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:16:45):**  That there is much more than just a physical interaction that we have with nature and plants  
**[0:16:50-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:16:50):**  and each other and life around us.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:16:53):**  There is an invisible interaction which can be related to whole forms of idea that we  
**[0:16:59-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:16:59):**  hold onto and we call ourself that energetically attract things into our life and spew things  
**[0:17:06-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:17:06):**  out of us into our environment in emotional, mental ways and spiritual ways if you want  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:17:13):**  to just talk about something more subtle.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:17:17):**  Right, so in these subtleties it seems that we have to find a way to sort of re-sensitize  
**[0:17:23-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:17:23):**  our abilities of perception to be able to garner any information or to be open for the  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:17:31):**  communications that are done at these very subtle levels.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:17:35):**  Now was it a conscious effort on your part to be open to these subtle communications?  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:17:39):**  Yeah, at times but I'm quite lazy.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:17:43):**  So that conscious effort wasn't much of an effort.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:17:49):**  So that's probably why it was slower for me.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:17:51):**  So if someone were to try and redevelop that sensitivity.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:17:55):**  Yeah, I mean there are many different exercises and practices that you can do sitting down  
**[0:18:02-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:18:02):**  in your garden in front of a plant or just hanging out in nature in the wild somewhere.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:18:10):**  But one of the key things is to first of all to open your mind that there is more than  
**[0:18:16-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:18:16):**  meets the eye to this world that we're living in.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:18:19):**  There is more than meets the eye to ourselves.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:18:22):**  There is a different level of consciousness within which we can experience this world  
**[0:18:28-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:18:28):**  and life and we can raise our awareness if you like by learning and teaching ourselves  
**[0:18:34-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:18:34):**  to see more, to see what is normally a little bit hidden in this world.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:18:40):**  And the fundamental practice there comes with observation.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:18:43):**  It comes with sitting down and listening because we're very active mentally a lot of the time  
**[0:18:48-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:18:48):**  and that's where you'll find your mind is very much goal orientated and projecting out  
**[0:18:56-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:18:56):**  to some type of future that we want to create and we are actively thinking instead of passively  
**[0:19:04-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:19:04):**  listening.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:19:05):**  And these are two energetics which we need at different times in our life but if we want  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:19:11):**  to interact more consciously with nature we'll need to learn to sit a little bit more in  
**[0:19:16-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:19:16):**  the feminine and be more passive listeners.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:19:22):**  On that note we are fortunate enough to live in a part of Guatemala where the indigenous  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:19:27):**  culture is still sort of the prevalent culture where we are which isn't to say that it hasn't  
**[0:19:32-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:19:32):**  been unaffected by the very complex history of Guatemala and colonialism in this area  
**[0:19:38-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:19:38):**  but have you been able to learn much and sort of absorb some of the wisdom of the local  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:19:44):**  teachings that has informed the way that you manage the garden and the ecosystem around  
**[0:19:49-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:19:49):**  you?  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:19:50):**  Well, I don't know.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:19:54):**  Being here you have to slow down a little bit.  
**[0:19:57-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:19:57):**  Time will every experience.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:19:59):**  I'm still struggling with that.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:20:00):**  I'm a very punctual person and I'm not used to everything being late.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:20:05):**  No, no, three o'clock isn't three o'clock.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:20:07):**  I know I showed up on time I know you weren't expecting me.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:20:11):**  So that teaches you something alone by just hanging out with people that are on a more  
**[0:20:17-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:20:17):**  natural schedule, a schedule which is not so much focused on the 24-7 hour clock type  
**[0:20:24-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:20:24):**  story and yet they're learning that and they're becoming more in it but it was only like not  
**[0:20:34-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:20:34):**  too many generations ago where there was no watches in this town.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:20:42):**  That changes a lot.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:20:43):**  And that makes us sort of also be more aware of and be more patient and that patience is  
**[0:20:51-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:20:51):**  something that you need if you're going to work in a garden because things don't happen  
**[0:20:54-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:20:54):**  overnight.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:20:55):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:20:56):**  Plants grow slowly you know you can see what you want as the fruit of your spoils and your  
**[0:21:02-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:21:02):**  work but that doesn't mean you're going to get it until the time is right.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:21:09):**  Right.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:21:10):**  If only so much you can accelerate nature has to take its own course.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:21:13):**  Just hanging around with the people here will influence us on that level and they are and  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:21:20):**  yeah I mean not as much today with the youth of today because there's been a generation  
**[0:21:25-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:21:25):**  gap change in different places but yeah there's a lot of people have already grown their own  
**[0:21:33-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:21:33):**  food.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:21:34):**  That's huge.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:21:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:21:36):**  You know.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:21:37):**  And they're not removed from that process.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:21:38):**  Yeah, if they are they're removed from one generation.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:21:41):**  Yeah my dad still grows our food to tell you the story but I don't because I've got a job  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:21:45):**  doing something else but that means that there's a natural connection to the earth and that  
**[0:21:51-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:21:51):**  there's the people are naturally more earthy in nature.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:21:58):**  Yeah however there's you know there's even when I got here years ago there's already  
**[0:22:03-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:22:03):**  been the influence of the Western culture that means a lot of the old practices have  
**[0:22:11-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:22:11):**  been lost already.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:22:12):**  Part of the garden, the purpose of the garden, the medicinal garden that I inherited if you  
**[0:22:19-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:22:19):**  like was to keep a little bit of the more natural remedies alive in the local communities  
**[0:22:26-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:22:26):**  that were fastly jumping into pharmacies and buying everything and trusting doctors that  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:22:30):**  probably weren't very well educated you know instead of their ancestral knowledge and so  
**[0:22:35-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:22:35):**  there's a lot less.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:22:37):**  There's already you know in when I got here at that time a lot less knowledge about medicinal  
**[0:22:43-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:22:43):**  herbs of the area than there probably would have been 50 years ago.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:22:51):**  And I've learned a bunch about the medicinal plants here from some people but there's not  
**[0:22:57-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:22:57):**  a huge amount of knowledge that is still used regularly.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:23:03):**  Simple stuff yeah ABCs yeah the first aid box people know certain first aid plants around  
**[0:23:12-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:23:12):**  here but a lot of people have forgotten too.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:23:16):**  One of the ways that you've illustrated how plants can communicate in ways that maybe  
**[0:23:22-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:23:22):**  are even a little easier to perceive from the beginning even if it's still hard to decipher  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:23:26):**  is in the story that you told me just very recently about how you used to go on herb  
**[0:23:31-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:23:31):**  walks with students or with people who went to the center and you notice that in certain  
**[0:23:37-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:23:37):**  areas around San Marcos before it was as developed as it is now certain medicines or plants would  
**[0:23:45-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:23:45):**  grow in an area and just a few meters away would not do so well and the same with the  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:23:51):**  garden that you cultivated in your personal site and the gardens that you maintained at  
**[0:23:55-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:23:55):**  the retreat center not very far away at all seemingly in the same microclimate and struggled  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:24:03):**  or flourished in one site to the other and sort of in investigating that you learned  
**[0:24:08-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:24:08):**  quite a bit.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:24:09):**  Yeah I mean the biggest thing that I realized was that the first observation that caught  
**[0:24:16-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:24:16):**  my attention was this was the simple nature I would go on this walk of maybe 400 meters  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:24:22):**  or something 500 meters that went through different people's plots of lands because  
**[0:24:27-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:24:27):**  it was along the lakefront and everybody owned up to the lakefront there's a lot of moisture  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:24:30):**  a lot of a lot of medicinal plants growing in that semi-wild environment even though  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:24:35):**  there was a little path there that people would walk on and I started seeing that there  
**[0:24:40-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:24:40):**  were certain medicinal plants that would only grow in some places and not in others and  
**[0:24:43-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:24:43):**  I started realizing that it was like the idea popped in there that okay so yeah then the  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:24:50):**  vibrational energy of this person's garden seems to be different than one meter away  
**[0:24:56-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:24:56):**  this guy's garden or not even garden but land that they owned that maybe they had abandoned  
**[0:25:03-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:25:03):**  or just left and there wasn't much going on there anyway but there was still an owner  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:25:07):**  of it then I started recognizing also in my garden that some things would grow that wouldn't  
**[0:25:11-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:25:11):**  grow just you know 20 meters away where I was trying to cultivate it there were other  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:25:16):**  things like you know I'd go into people's gardens my friend's gardens and suddenly I  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:25:21):**  noticed wow you've got a lot of this when did you plant this didn't plant it ever where  
**[0:25:25-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:25:25):**  did it come from I don't know it just popped up this year whatever and I remember reading  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:25:30):**  it in some way I could not tell you I have no idea what where it was but I remember reading  
**[0:25:34-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:25:34):**  it somewhere that there was a herbologist had recognized in his next-door neighbor's  
**[0:25:40-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:25:40):**  garden you know some plants popping up that were good for healing cancer that that year  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:25:47):**  his next-door neighbor got diagnosed with and the plants were growing there he noticed  
**[0:25:52-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:25:52):**  it out of his window but and the plants grew there until the guy died of cancer maybe six  
**[0:25:59-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:25:59):**  months later next year they didn't grow I remember reading that not really understanding  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:26:03):**  what that was or maybe understanding it yeah but not experiencing it let's say but then  
**[0:26:09-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:26:09):**  I started seeing oh my goodness you know them people's energy or people's personal vibration  
**[0:26:17-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:26:17):**  because these two identical plots of land not touched either of them probably similar  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:26:23):**  history to them one had you know a huge amount of one medicinal plant and the other had a  
**[0:26:28-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:26:28):**  different medicinal plant and they're 20 meters away let's say this showed me that okay maybe  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:26:35):**  there is an influence and I'm an invisible influence let's say that something is happening  
**[0:26:41-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:26:41):**  over that land that can't really be easily described as a physical one let's say that  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:26:48):**  because energetically or physically wise nothing much is different between one of the other  
**[0:26:53-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:26:53):**  but as far as ownership and people's personal energetic space is concerned maybe those two  
**[0:27:00-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:27:00):**  plots of land are very difficult a different or maybe the influence upon them that is the  
**[0:27:07-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:27:07):**  subtle differences is the influence of the human people that live there or come there  
**[0:27:15-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:27:15):**  or call it their own and us when I started seeing that then I started seeing it everywhere  
**[0:27:22-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:27:22):**  and I would walk into people's gardens and diagnose their physical ailments by looking  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:27:29):**  at the medicinal plants that were growing naturally in their garden and they go oh yeah  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:27:33):**  you're right I do have these liver problems how did you know well you've got a lot of  
**[0:27:37-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:27:37):**  these growing in your garden and usually comes for a reason I started to realize that nature  
**[0:27:44-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:27:44):**  has this intrinsic quality of creating balance and does that mean that you can accentuate  
**[0:27:52-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:27:52):**  that connection that you have with your land by interacting with it in more direct ways  
**[0:27:56-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:27:56):**  sure I mean a lot of people are you know peeing in their garden walking barefoot in their  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:28:01):**  garden having showers in their garden to share some more of their physical cells and you  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:28:07):**  know leave them when you're leaving a footprint it's more than just in the mark of your foot  
**[0:28:12-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:28:12):**  on the floor but there's also some cells that are falling off and sitting on the ground  
**[0:28:16-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:28:16):**  as well there's many ways that we can physically interact with or put more of our physical  
**[0:28:23-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:28:23):**  genetics in the soil if you like which people practice I do as well but that's only that's  
**[0:28:33-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:28:33):**  only on physical levels energetically if you just go and be in the place or if you interact  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:28:39):**  with plants more regularly or if you just walk around your garden more consciously or  
**[0:28:44-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:28:44):**  if you just be there then your garden will feel you and you'll feel it they did experiments  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:28:50):**  where they were taking people blindfolded and sensory deprived in some way and put them  
**[0:28:54-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:28:54):**  you know in one sort of concrete place and then in a wooded place and ask them to just  
**[0:28:58-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:28:58):**  tell them how they felt yeah and people would feel different things just being from in one  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:29:04):**  vibrational space to another and that's because there's a lot more going on in a woodland  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:29:09):**  or a jungle than there is not maybe a lot more but a different set of energetics going  
**[0:29:14-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:29:14):**  on than there is in you know concrete city or something yeah I mean that certainly explains  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:29:22):**  why people feel this need to get back out into nature to reconnect with nature and some  
**[0:29:27-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:29:27):**  people have an allergy of it right some people are so used to the city that they have an  
**[0:29:30-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:29:30):**  allergy at the moment they're in nature and it feels uncomfortable and too much too much  
**[0:29:35-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:29:35):**  nature is is awkward and uncomfortable yeah but that's yeah that seems to be a sign of  
**[0:29:44-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:29:44):**  one of the ailments of our societies maybe perhaps um so with all of these different  
**[0:29:49-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:29:49):**  observations and intuitive ways of learning that you've picked up on since you started  
**[0:29:54-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:29:54):**  to sort of reconnect and and observe a little more how has that affected your own interaction  
**[0:30:00-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:30:00):**  with your gardening style with the way that you sort of traverse the landscape around  
**[0:30:06-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:30:06):**  here well you're asking the wrong person because I kind of I garden less and less I you know  
**[0:30:13-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:30:13):**  propagate plants a little bit but uh but yeah over the years one of the luxuries of living  
**[0:30:23-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:30:23):**  in Guatemala for those people who don't understand what it's like to be here is that um there's  
**[0:30:31-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:30:31):**  a luxury to be able to get your hands in the soil and do and work with plants in in many  
**[0:30:35-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:30:35):**  ways and I still do it from time to time um but one of the luxuries is is that where you  
**[0:30:41-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:30:41):**  can you can get um the minimum salary here let's say it's not very it's not very high  
**[0:30:47-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:30:47):**  and so it's easy to find um great workers to interact with and to share with um that  
**[0:30:54-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:30:54):**  can do a lot of manual labor that I don't do so I do a lot more managing of garden than  
**[0:30:59-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:30:59):**  I do physical work in the garden which is not my preferred job but but it's one that  
**[0:31:05-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:31:05):**  you know my maybe my learning over the years has made me understand I'm more effective  
**[0:31:12-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:31:12):**  if I can tell a few guys what to do instead of sure and we definitely do quite a bit of  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:31:18):**  that up at the farm as well the only reason we've been able to I know you guys do so yeah  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:31:22):**  so as far as the gardening is concerned what I what we do in the garden yeah what are what  
**[0:31:26-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:31:26):**  we try and create in in these spaces is is aspects you know different different environmental  
**[0:31:34-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:31:34):**  interactions that are going on between trees and bushes and all sorts of things and have  
**[0:31:38-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:31:38):**  some some morphing environment that's that's gradually evolving into um partly manicured  
**[0:31:46-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:31:46):**  but not really and partly just just observed um interaction between medicinal plants um  
**[0:31:54-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:31:54):**  plants that make you feel good that inspire you with with crazy flowers and and and their  
**[0:32:02-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:32:02):**  aesthetical beauty to you know to lettuces and squash and some of those were more lots  
**[0:32:12-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:32:12):**  of beans were more accustomed to yeah and and to have a good mixture of everything you  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:32:18):**  know having a wonderful interaction in in ways that can teach me so much more about  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:32:23):**  what does work and what doesn't work because I've not come to my limitations on that front  
**[0:32:27-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:32:27):**  ever have you observed some really good companion relationships among the plants that you cultivate  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:32:33):**  sure I mean there's the obvious ones like this plant love shade and that plant you know  
**[0:32:38-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:32:38):**  likes less wind so put these two together then they're going to go very well this plant  
**[0:32:44-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:32:44):**  um is going to like the type of soil um is going to grow very superficially and this  
**[0:32:51-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:32:51):**  other plant has got roots that grow really deep so you can plant them together a lot  
**[0:32:55-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:32:55):**  of the time there are the logical um interactions with plants which are all very well documented  
**[0:33:02-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:33:02):**  and plants which excrete certain things I've seen more what what what type of plants don't  
**[0:33:07-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:33:07):**  like to grow with other plants the the plants that actually um collaborate quite well and  
**[0:33:13-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:33:13):**  there are some plants that that won't don't want to grow with other ones I've seen that  
**[0:33:17-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:33:17):**  a bunch of things especially in the herbal world just because some I think a little bit  
**[0:33:21-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:33:21):**  finicky it could be something to do with this this uh environment but and a lot of them  
**[0:33:24-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:33:24):**  have such strong compounds that I would imagine are not attractive to some of their neighbors  
**[0:33:29-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:33:29):**  yeah and there's some that just well they just won't grow next to certain types of plants  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:33:33):**  and it's not a physical thing there's a weird sort of weird repulsion you learn that and  
**[0:33:38-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:33:38):**  sometimes the plants will actually you know maybe tell you yeah in more ways than just  
**[0:33:44-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:33:44):**  I'm going to die if you don't move me stupid I mean that would be pretty eye-opening for  
**[0:33:52-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:33:52):**  me if that's how I learned to listen to plants and they just start cursing at me well I told  
**[0:33:58-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:33:58):**  you I was really embarrassed I was really embarrassed like probably 80 years down the  
**[0:34:03-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:34:03):**  line after playing in the garden a lot you know um realizing that my own ego had had  
**[0:34:09-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:34:09):**  um had owned this communication that I was experiencing with the plans as when I back  
**[0:34:17-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:34:17):**  in the days when I was doing a lot more work myself um I realized you know I realized a  
**[0:34:24-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:34:24):**  lot afterwards that the plants were actually influencing my ideas and teaching me and they  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:34:30):**  were probably you know without wanting to personify a plan you know they were probably  
**[0:34:35-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:34:35):**  just shouting from the other end of the garden gay hey idiot come over here you haven't looked  
**[0:34:40-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:34:40):**  at me for a long time if you don't do something about it I'm going to die and then you're  
**[0:34:45-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:34:45):**  going to lose me and I walk over and for some reason that you know because I'm so smart  
**[0:34:50-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:34:50):**  and clever my my my eye got caught on that one plant that oh my goodness I didn't notice  
**[0:34:56-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:34:56):**  you know and my self-importance thought oh aren't I clever for figuring that out who  
**[0:35:00-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:35:00):**  if I hadn't got in there but really the plant was has probably been shouting at me for weeks  
**[0:35:04-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:35:04):**  and in the one moment I was open to listen I actually heard it quieted the mind down  
**[0:35:09-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:35:09):**  you know well that that's more maybe you know just choosing what work to do or what what  
**[0:35:16-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:35:16):**  needs to be done and what what is of more urgency than than not I mean I learned a lot  
**[0:35:23-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:35:23):**  about there you know lunar cycles and um and astrological planting as well and I studied  
**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:35:28):**  a bit of that and got really into it and nerded out a little bit on that before I realized  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:35:32):**  oh fuck it man there's so there's certain things that just don't work you know yeah  
**[0:35:38-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:35:38):**  I can't and I'm not going to be so rational about it and I'm not such maybe such a rational  
**[0:35:43-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:35:43):**  person as you are and so you know after a while I was going now I was like let's just  
**[0:35:47-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:35:47):**  listen instead yeah and that worked quite well yeah and I'm really trying to just cultivate  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:35:52):**  a bit more of a balance within that personality trait that I tend towards and you know there's  
**[0:35:57-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:35:57):**  there's advantages to both sides but if you're too out of balance in in any one too overdeveloped  
**[0:36:03-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:36:03):**  in another um it can really throw off your interactions and you can miss some things  
**[0:36:08-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:36:08):**  that turn about the middle path yeah exactly exactly now along that line you've been instrumental  
**[0:36:16-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:36:16):**  along with your partner Anna in creating this place that you've called the seed can you  
**[0:36:22-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:36:22):**  tell us a little bit about this property what the original vision and intention was for  
**[0:36:26-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:36:26):**  it and how it's sort of grown as you've lived here well we we came here with the idea to  
**[0:36:35-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:36:35):**  to really maximize and transform this place into something wonderfully biodiverse you  
**[0:36:47-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:36:47):**  know half the trees were dead when we got here it's pretty abandoned spot of land lot  
**[0:36:53-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:36:53):**  of coffee and a lot of mono culture if you like but then there's trees and other things  
**[0:36:57-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:36:57):**  and we bought little plots of land next door and the plot of land that we're managing is  
**[0:37:05-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:37:05):**  is growing or looking after if you like is growing or had been growing over the years  
**[0:37:10-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:37:10):**  but but my yeah my wife is is very much uh into what is aesthetically pleasing um for  
**[0:37:20-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:37:20):**  me I'm more of a practical guy get me some vegetables I echo that as well medicine but  
**[0:37:27-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:37:27):**  but at the same the same time yeah so I may have I have that lack which is more a male  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:37:33):**  thing no let's get some medicine and food get guy so we grow a lot of medicine and food  
**[0:37:38-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:37:38):**  but we grow a lot of beautiful plants too that that um in the bigger picture inspire  
**[0:37:47-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:37:47):**  and and and excite you in in subtle ways that we're not we're not normally aware of but  
**[0:37:53-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:37:53):**  there's yeah there's something about being surrounded by an abundant amount of flowers  
**[0:37:58-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:37:58):**  and having to bump into them all over the place and seeing aesthetical beauty of planting  
**[0:38:03-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:38:03):**  plants in their right places and creating spaces which can then you know prosper and  
**[0:38:11-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:38:11):**  be left alone more and more and more over the years as well as being you know productive  
**[0:38:16-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:38:16):**  and efficient I I stopped planting a lot of medicinal plants many many years ago um formally  
**[0:38:23-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:38:23):**  so because I you know I I learned how to encourage self-seeding and and to promote it and so  
**[0:38:32-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:38:32):**  the probably the amount of medicinal plants on our land here per square meter is you know  
**[0:38:40-0:38:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:38:40):**  10 times what would be in other in other areas um very close to us just because of selective  
**[0:38:47-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:38:47):**  weeding over the years and allowing land to and allowing the plants to to propagate themselves  
**[0:38:53-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:38:53):**  you you end up getting a lot more of everything um sometimes in you know in an unneeded way  
**[0:39:00-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:39:00):**  but but and then allowing spaces in the garden that are wild is super important there has  
**[0:39:08-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:39:08):**  to be a certain amount of wildness that's not touched in the garden why is that because  
**[0:39:15-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:39:15):**  it's where the fairies live oliver I was waiting for one of these sarcastic responses not a  
**[0:39:23-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:39:23):**  sarcastic it's actually it's actually a real response but um yeah there's a certain there's  
**[0:39:29-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:39:29):**  a certain um there's some energetics of yeah you think it's you think it's okay I mean  
**[0:39:36-0:39:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:39:36):**  I know how you can twist that and and okay there are there are so what you actually mean  
**[0:39:40-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:39:40):**  there are there's always your tone you always make me feel like I asked the wrong question  
**[0:39:45-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:39:45):**  no no it's not definitely not the wrong question it's just um yeah it's literally where the  
**[0:39:51-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:39:51):**  fairies live um have um have a couple of friends who came down from from Iceland and they were  
**[0:39:57-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:39:57):**  telling us um that in Iceland there's um there's a ministry of elves in the government yeah  
**[0:40:04-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:40:04):**  if you want to go into a place and develop it in somewhere first of all you have to get  
**[0:40:09-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:40:09):**  this guy who can speak to the fairies or the elves if you like and he'll go in there and  
**[0:40:14-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:40:14):**  he'll say no I'm sorry yes you can do things here or no you can't do things here according  
**[0:40:19-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:40:19):**  to where the fairies are living um it's so strong in in the Icelandic culture that everybody  
**[0:40:26-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:40:26):**  believes in it and there's a governmental ministry for it um yeah it shocked me too yeah  
**[0:40:32-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:40:32):**  that's remarkable just look at me and in disbelief yeah no it's true I can believe then it's true  
**[0:40:40-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:40:40):**  um while I don't have that maybe the consciousness of to be a ministry of elves member um I do  
**[0:40:47-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:40:47):**  know that there are certain there is an importance in just leaving something that is not touched  
**[0:40:53-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:40:53):**  and by human manipulation and allowing that certain space if it feels special enough just  
**[0:41:00-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:41:00):**  to do its own thing if you have the luxury not to touch some area of land which you are  
**[0:41:05-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:41:05):**  supposed to be looking after and leave nature and and the the fairies and the elves to do  
**[0:41:10-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:41:10):**  their thing then there's different ways to talk about and there is I mean different interdimensional  
**[0:41:15-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:41:15):**  entities but we can call them elves because most people know what they are yeah no I think  
**[0:41:20-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:41:20):**  this is very valid to talk about adding different names to it might be culturally relevant depending  
**[0:41:25-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:41:25):**  on where you are but I definitely get what you're what you're hinting at basically being  
**[0:41:30-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:41:30):**  um the what the entities or the the I guess I don't know another way to say it I guess  
**[0:41:37-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:41:37):**  elves was a good was a good name for at least I saw him on the side I caught you a gift  
**[0:41:43-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:41:43):**  um for the for your listeners as well I mean they probably um the energies or the magic  
**[0:41:50-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:41:50):**  of a place yeah it's it's very hard to define by the ways that we normally have to observe  
**[0:41:54-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:41:54):**  and keep track or measure things but I definitely understand what you're what you're getting  
**[0:41:59-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:41:59):**  at there is um there is let's say let's say there's just like there is um a higher consciousness  
**[0:42:05-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:42:05):**  inside of us an unawareness and a potential and that we tap into in those moments of genius  
**[0:42:12-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:42:12):**  and those moments of super inspiration that we connect to in those moments when we feel  
**[0:42:16-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:42:16):**  empowered and and we feel a strong purpose in our life when we're that's in those moments  
**[0:42:21-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:42:21):**  that we're touching our spirit if you like or touching a higher consciousness that is  
**[0:42:25-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:42:25):**  when life is flowing and and when if you have the awareness not to give yourself all the  
**[0:42:30-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:42:30):**  credit for that yeah when we're not so attached to the mundane yeah yeah um we we get to have  
**[0:42:37-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:42:37):**  different experiences a lot of people are provoking different experiences by taking  
**[0:42:43-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:42:43):**  drugs and things like this which which is which is one way to do it and that's why people  
**[0:42:46-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:42:46):**  open up their awareness on on different ways but um but we all experience life in more  
**[0:42:53-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:42:53):**  ways than just the physical we just don't pay attention to it mostly we don't pay attention  
**[0:42:59-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:42:59):**  how our energy our emotional energetics or mental energetics are going to influence our  
**[0:43:03-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:43:03):**  environment we don't pay attention or influence each other we think if it doesn't come out  
**[0:43:08-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:43:08):**  of our head well that's just for us then you know that's just not going to influence my  
**[0:43:12-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:43:12):**  environment or anybody around me we're not aware that you know thinking about some somebody  
**[0:43:18-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:43:18):**  and feeling things towards somebody is a form of communication too for example okay we're  
**[0:43:25-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:43:25):**  starting to realize this people are starting to prove this and there are you know hundreds  
**[0:43:30-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:43:30):**  and hundreds of psychological tests that people are doing um which show the scientists they  
**[0:43:35-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:43:35):**  can't really understand why certain things has happened there's quantum physics which  
**[0:43:40-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:43:40):**  is coming into it and teaching things that you know that the consciousness of of of observing  
**[0:43:46-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:43:46):**  something actually changes how it inter-reacts and things like this how a simple atom or  
**[0:43:52-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:43:52):**  a molecule inter-reacts is changed by the consciousness of human observation this is  
**[0:43:57-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:43:57):**  something that you know has been proven on the quantum physics level and science will  
**[0:44:03-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:44:03):**  get there eventually but I think it's a certain amount of common sense inside of us that recognizes  
**[0:44:09-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:44:09):**  yet there's you know our energetical field if you like our electromagnetic field if you  
**[0:44:15-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:44:15):**  want to call it that it stretches out beyond the limitations of our physical skin and will  
**[0:44:20-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:44:20):**  in some way or another influence other people in our environment in invisible ways ways  
**[0:44:25-0:44:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:44:25):**  which we do not recognize or understand these type of things might take a while for the  
**[0:44:30-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:44:30):**  mind to believe or open up to or or actually start to hold on to or these these ideas might  
**[0:44:38-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:44:38):**  be very easy for your mind to hold on to it doesn't matter you might not want to believe  
**[0:44:41-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:44:41):**  in that you might not want to believe in magic you might just want to believe in in the physical  
**[0:44:46-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:44:46):**  damage this is fine as well this is okay we don't have to believe in these things um but  
**[0:44:51-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:44:51):**  more and more uh science is coming closer to spirituality and recognizing there are  
**[0:44:57-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:44:57):**  there are there is something called consciousness which we can't really understand we can't  
**[0:45:02-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:45:02):**  really define very well um but definitely has an obvious influence over the environment  
**[0:45:09-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:45:09):**  in ways we don't understand well on that note and I know I'm taking a bit of your precious  
**[0:45:15-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:45:15):**  time here can you give our listeners a way to contact you or or the resources at the  
**[0:45:22-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:45:22):**  seed in order to learn more about some of these concepts you've talked about sure I  
**[0:45:26-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:45:26):**  mean um if you want to share this podcast I'll share it too on my Facebook page and  
**[0:45:32-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:45:32):**  website Marcus Vesey PontoCom as they say which needs to be spelled out if you're gonna  
**[0:45:41-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:45:41):**  find that but I'll put the links of this show notes of the week of the episode I'm sure  
**[0:45:45-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:45:45):**  you'll do that marvelous and I know you've also got a gardening course planned coming  
**[0:45:50-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:45:50):**  up um what are some of the the main ideas that you're hoping to cover for for the participants  
**[0:45:56-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:45:56):**  there um talking about the local course this is well this is a course I mean I've been  
**[0:46:03-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:46:03):**  here for like such a long time and I've never given a course in Spanish and cachical the  
**[0:46:08-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:46:08):**  local language here that we the the Mayan um uh people speak is cachical and so um I  
**[0:46:18-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:46:18):**  don't speak very good cachical no mine is rubbish too I speak good Spanish um but because  
**[0:46:24-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:46:24):**  um my teachings have been predominantly to travelers and and tourists and on different  
**[0:46:31-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:46:31):**  levels I've nearly always have translated into Spanish at some time but I've never done  
**[0:46:36-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:46:36):**  a course in cachical so I want to do I want to in a way give back some of the wonderful  
**[0:46:43-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:46:43):**  teachings that I've had over all these years and even you know even if it'd taken me so  
**[0:46:47-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:46:47):**  long to learn them I want to give back a little bit to the community and and share some of  
**[0:46:53-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:46:53):**  some of the wisdom that maybe they've lost at one time and to share the knowledge about  
**[0:47:00-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:47:00):**  interacting with with nature more consciously and to really show people what what medicine  
**[0:47:07-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:47:07):**  is growing on everybody's doorstep and nobody is using because they don't recognize it or  
**[0:47:12-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:47:12):**  have the knowledge of how to use it so I want to you know share a bit of them a metaphysical  
**[0:47:17-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:47:17):**  um ideas that the local people are much more open to than certain closed minds and um because  
**[0:47:27-0:47:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:47:27):**  they haven't drifted so far into so into a strong logical brains to the point where they  
**[0:47:34-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:47:34):**  they they trust everything much much more much more openly and and they are not maybe  
**[0:47:42-0:47:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:47:42):**  as not as many generations away from a more natural interaction where nature teaches us  
**[0:47:48-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:47:48):**  to listen and to observe and be teaching us to balance so maybe maybe certain things they're  
**[0:47:55-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:47:55):**  going to be teaching me in this course but I want to share a lot of um sort of practical  
**[0:48:01-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:48:01):**  knowledge of how to get into a garden and make make abundance of food and medicine without  
**[0:48:07-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:48:07):**  huge amount of effort and how to really appreciate all you know how to maybe maybe bring a little  
**[0:48:15-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:48:15):**  bit of ritual and gratitude back into our interactions with nature and giving thanks  
**[0:48:20-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:48:20):**  to what could be an abundant environment but often isn't right because we because it's  
**[0:48:27-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:48:27):**  managed so badly yeah um and so you know the majority of our of our community of the local  
**[0:48:34-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:48:34):**  community here our agricultural nature um growing some type of crop crop whether it's  
**[0:48:40-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:48:40):**  coffee corn or avocados or or cotties right and um and so they already have that there's  
**[0:48:49-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:48:49):**  already so much interaction with plants that that I won't need to share with them but I'm  
**[0:48:55-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:48:55):**  going to share with them some some ideas which maybe maybe they haven't bumped into but then  
**[0:49:00-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:49:00):**  can enrich their experience in in in the you know in in in their own gardens in their own  
**[0:49:08-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:49:08):**  experience and I really want to get get some young people who are interested in medicine  
**[0:49:12-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:49:12):**  and uh and spark off um a few remembering of of the of the old the old school medicines  
**[0:49:22-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:49:22):**  yeah that's definitely what you can hope for and I know we've been talking about this for  
**[0:49:26-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:49:26):**  a month I'm really excited for attending that course as well I'm sure I'll learn a lot in  
**[0:49:29-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:49:29):**  it too so well I mean we have to make it a little bit simple and a little bit easy and  
**[0:49:34-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:49:34):**  a little bit um experiential well always it's not always an experience blah blah blah and  
**[0:49:42-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:49:42):**  intellectual this that and everything else right right it's going to be a little bit  
**[0:49:45-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:49:45):**  more a little bit less talking and a little bit more doing yeah I can't wait well again  
**[0:49:50-0:49:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:49:50):**  Marcus thanks so much for taking the time today it's always a pleasure to come here  
**[0:49:53-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:49:53):**  and visit you it's always a pleasure to have you Oliver and one thing I want to mention  
**[0:49:57-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:49:57):**  too is that though we're kind of on the different spectrum of our personality types and and  
**[0:50:03-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:50:03):**  sometimes the way we look at the world less than you think well definitely a lot less  
**[0:50:07-0:50:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:50:07):**  than I think but my favorite part about this is somehow we've still come to the same conclusion  
**[0:50:12-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:50:12):**  that our default uniform be a v-neck white t-shirt and khaki you just call me whatever  
**[0:50:19-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:50:19):**  you're always in the same clothes I know I'm always in the same clothes it's our de facto  
**[0:50:24-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:50:24):**  uniform every time we see each other must be that psychic connection psychic connection  
**[0:50:29-0:50:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:50:29):**  makes us put that white yeah well this is all I ever wear this is all I ever wear so  
**[0:50:35-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:50:35):**  well again thanks for making time man we'll catch up again soon good good thanks a lot  
**[0:50:40-0:50:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-marcus-veysey/#t=0:50:40):**  Oliver all right see ya thank you so much for tuning into this week's episode as always

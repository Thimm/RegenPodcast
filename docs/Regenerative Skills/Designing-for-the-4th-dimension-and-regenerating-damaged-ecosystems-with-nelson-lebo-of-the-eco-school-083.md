**[0:02:23-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:02:23):**  We're looking forward to seeing you here.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:02:26):**  The international presence of the permaculture movement has always been an inspiration to  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:02:30):**  me and in today's interview I had the pleasure of talking with Nelson Lebo of the Eco School  
**[0:02:35-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:02:35):**  in Wanganui in the North Island of New Zealand.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:02:38):**  Nelson first reached out to me after hearing about some of our similar experiences on this  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:02:42):**  podcast and I became fascinated with the development of his own farm in the unique factors in his  
**[0:02:47-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:02:47):**  area of New Zealand.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:02:49):**  Now in this interview Nelson speaks in depth about why he prefers to work with severely  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:02:53):**  degraded land rather than pristine ecosystems and the challenges of permaculture triage  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:02:59):**  on a limited budget.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:03:00):**  From there we explore how he approaches the building and development of systems and models  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:03:05):**  that are replicable and scalable and that are also economically viable.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:03:10):**  We also talk about adapting to severe weather, the time dimension within design, and the  
**[0:03:15-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:03:15):**  urgency of farming as if our children's lives depend on it.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:03:19):**  This is a remarkably broad and far reaching interview.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:03:21):**  Bear with me for the couple of minutes of rough audio as Nelson was recording his side  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:03:25):**  from a local public library but grab your notebooks and I'll now turn things over to  
**[0:03:30-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:03:30):**  Nelson Lebo.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:03:32):**  Hey Nelson thanks so much for getting on the podcast today.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:03:35):**  I know the time difference is really large.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:03:38):**  You're down in New Zealand right?  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:03:40):**  Yeah that's right but I'm an early riser so I've probably been already up for six hours  
**[0:03:45-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:03:45):**  and it's only 10 a.m.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:03:47):**  Nice yeah I mean there's there's no going there's no getting started late in the day  
**[0:03:51-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:03:51):**  when you've got a farm to look after.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:03:53):**  I certainly can relate.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:03:55):**  But hey so I've got a ton of things I'd love to talk to you about so what do you say we  
**[0:03:58-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:03:58):**  just jump right into the questions.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:04:00):**  Yeah absolutely that'd be great.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:04:02):**  Marvelous so could you tell our listeners a little bit about your background how you  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:04:06):**  got started in permaculture farming and how you ended up in New Zealand.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:04:11):**  Yeah you know this could probably be a multi a multi episode podcast in and of itself so  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:04:19):**  I'll keep it really short.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:04:22):**  In 1986 when I went to university and my first day in university I took a course called In  
**[0:04:32-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:04:32):**  Environmental Studies 101 and just blew my mind I could not believe the extent of the  
**[0:04:42-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:04:42):**  environmental problems in the world and naively at the time I thought oh well all we need  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:04:49):**  to do is educate everyone about these problems and as soon as everyone is aware of them then  
**[0:04:55-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:04:55):**  they'll quickly be solved.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:04:58):**  Well here we are you know 32 years later and arguably by every measure the world is in  
**[0:05:04-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:05:04):**  a worse condition.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:05:07):**  So I mean along with trying to convince others to come along I decided fairly early on that  
**[0:05:17-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:05:17):**  having been through what you know a lot of years of schooling I came out with a lot of  
**[0:05:28-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:05:28):**  knowledge quote unquote but no skills at all and in my early adult life I wanted to learn  
**[0:05:35-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:05:35):**  to grow food and then later on that turned into learning to build and renovate homes  
**[0:05:43-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:05:43):**  as well and so all the learning I've done has essentially been informal itself taught  
**[0:05:50-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:05:50):**  I don't have a degree in agriculture, horticulture or in building but I'm just a voracious learner  
**[0:05:59-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:05:59):**  like most permacultures are I'll take every opportunity to learn and I'm also an educator  
**[0:06:06-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:06:06):**  and so a lot of what we do is we try essentially what we try to do is best practice land management  
**[0:06:15-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:06:15):**  and best practice education and we provide it all at very affordable prices for learners  
**[0:06:22-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:06:22):**  who want to come.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:06:23):**  Marvelous so tell me how you relocated to New Zealand and started putting all of this  
**[0:06:30-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:06:30):**  informal education into practice and how it's developed into what it is today.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:06:34):**  Cool yeah same I forgot I forgot about that part of the question now I was a high school  
**[0:06:42-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:06:42):**  science teacher for 14 years and I also had a I bought a rundown farm and I was developing  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:06:53):**  that into a permaculture property simultaneously so basically I was working year round you  
**[0:06:59-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:06:59):**  know never had a day off essentially but in 2007 let me get this straight 2006 I went  
**[0:07:11-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:07:11):**  to Ladakh India and had a really great experience up in Ladakh at a school called Secmal which  
**[0:07:18-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:07:18):**  is pretty famous with sort of permaculture in Himalayas really inspiring and then I got  
**[0:07:27-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:07:27):**  back and I was working on my farm herniated a disc in my back really bad injury super  
**[0:07:35-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:07:35):**  painful then that led to sort of thinking okay well what do I want to do with my rest  
**[0:07:45-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:07:45):**  of my life my teaching career was basically I hit a glass ceiling teaching in a school  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:07:53):**  and they kept talking about a commitment to the environment but never actually really  
**[0:07:58-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:07:58):**  doing anything substantial lots of tokenism so between an injured back and a glass ceiling  
**[0:08:06-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:08:06):**  where I was teaching and experience doing organic market gardening for about seven or  
**[0:08:16-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:08:16):**  eight years it was the classic midlife crisis I thought okay what can I do for a big change  
**[0:08:23-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:08:23):**  of pace so what I decided to do is to take my experience in as a science teacher take  
**[0:08:29-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:08:29):**  my experience as a organic grower and as an eco builder and combine it into a PhD research  
**[0:08:40-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:08:40):**  where essentially citizen scientists which are really what permacultures are eco designers  
**[0:08:50-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:08:50):**  and citizen scientists can be used to inspire high school students to learn science in a  
**[0:08:57-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:08:57):**  local relevant context and what better place to do that then as far away from the rest  
**[0:09:05-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:09:05):**  of your life as possible so essentially packed up moved over here did my PhD in essentially  
**[0:09:13-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:09:13):**  integrating permaculture into high school science education really loved the climate  
**[0:09:20-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:09:20):**  over here loved the people loved the laid-back atmosphere and while I was while I was writing  
**[0:09:28-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:09:28):**  my thesis bought the worst house in New Zealand and renovated it into sort of a suburban permaculture  
**[0:09:37-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:09:37):**  renovation and then from there bought a small farm and boom you know now we're full on into  
**[0:09:45-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:09:45):**  regenerative agriculture marvelous that's quite a story now I know that one of your  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:09:52):**  passions is working with marginal or degraded land since there's sort of a sense of healing  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:09:57):**  and lots of room for regeneration within those ecosystems can you tell me some of the main  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:10:02):**  steps that you had to take in order to transform the farm that you bought into the one that  
**[0:10:07-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:10:07):**  is currently working for you now yeah so it's a it's a worn out horse property which means  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:10:17):**  there were there were definitely too many horses on the land the all the soil was compacted  
**[0:10:23-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:10:23):**  the soils were fairly acidic and steep slopes if you've ever been to New Zealand or if you've  
**[0:10:33-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:10:33):**  seen pictures of New Zealand oftentimes the the the really steep marginal land being grazed  
**[0:10:42-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:10:42):**  and so the first thing we did was get the horses off the property get heavy animals  
**[0:10:50-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:10:50):**  off of the property then in our paddocks the quickest and easiest thing to do is to add  
**[0:10:59-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:10:59):**  lime which is going to raise the pH which is going to favor biological activity in the  
**[0:11:06-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:11:06):**  soil and bring back more earthworms let the earthworms do the cultivating for us earthworms  
**[0:11:15-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:11:15):**  are more active at a more neutral pH get the horses off raise the pH in the market gardens  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:11:24):**  you know the whole different process of decompacting the soil on the slopes well we can talk all  
**[0:11:30-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:11:30):**  about slopes but it's a combination of planting planting the slopes up to trees but then you've  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:11:38):**  got to be careful about how you manage your stock we fenced off about a half a kilometer  
**[0:11:43-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:11:43):**  of stream protected the riparian corridor protected a historical wetland what used to  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:11:52):**  be a wetland and we've planted about probably two thousand native trees this would be our  
**[0:11:58-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:11:58):**  permaculture zone five and because of increased extreme weather events we're really really  
**[0:12:09-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:12:09):**  working hard on holding the stream banks in place and holding the hillsides in place because  
**[0:12:16-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:12:16):**  once the soil is gone you know it's gone forever yeah that's wild i know that you guys suffer  
**[0:12:21-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:12:21):**  a hundred year storm early after getting the farm tell me about how that impacted the land  
**[0:12:27-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:12:27):**  and how you recovered afterwards yeah so we we we got this piece of land which basic even  
**[0:12:38-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:12:38):**  though it was in a bad condition it had potential written all over it just so many micro climates  
**[0:12:46-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:12:46):**  relatively close to town and um so we had the vision of okay our our food forest is  
**[0:12:53-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:12:53):**  going to go here our market gardens are going to go here what tractor arch tooks over here  
**[0:13:00-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:13:00):**  and then down in the valley well we won't worry about that for for now and 10 months  
**[0:13:06-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:13:06):**  after we took possession we had this phenomenal storm essentially if you've been following  
**[0:13:14-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:13:14):**  what's about to happen in north and south carolina and what happened in houston last  
**[0:13:20-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:13:20):**  year this storm stalled over the top of us it behaved differently than all previous storms  
**[0:13:28-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:13:28):**  it stalled and it just dumped water and it kept dumping water and we we lost one entire  
**[0:13:35-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:13:35):**  hillside in in um down by this stream one section of stream we probably lost three to  
**[0:13:46-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:13:46):**  40 cubic meters of stream bank in one night and the next morning we went down to have  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:13:53):**  a look and i was blown away you know i knew you know i've been studying climate change  
**[0:13:58-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:13:58):**  for 30 years um but this was just in your face climate change like this is the future  
**[0:14:07-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:14:07):**  this is what it looks like so all of my priorities went from you know from market gardening and  
**[0:14:14-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:14:14):**  food forest to um what i call triage permaculture you know just stop the bleeding and um with  
**[0:14:24-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:14:24):**  the help of our regional council which is which is generous in terms of free advice  
**[0:14:31-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:14:31):**  and subsidized trees and plants and they've been subsidized the cost of fencing the um  
**[0:14:41-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:14:41):**  stream streams we've put in literally thousands of hours and cumulatively tens of thousands  
**[0:14:51-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:14:51):**  of dollars just to you know bit quote unquote stop the bleeding um and um at the same time  
**[0:14:59-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:14:59):**  to a certain extent what we do to flood proof our property also helps to drought proof our  
**[0:15:06-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:15:06):**  property yeah absolutely the importance of protecting those riparian zones can be the  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:15:12):**  difference between you know such a major disaster like that taking a huge amount of the resources  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:15:17):**  and the soil on a site and possibly even being a net gain i know that we've done this for  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:15:22):**  some of our clients here in guatemala the the rainy season can be quite devastating  
**[0:15:27-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:15:27):**  and very severe and most of the areas that are surrounded or that are surrounding the  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:15:33):**  water bodies especially the rivers and the the drainage canals lose a ton of material  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:15:38):**  during these seasons that all ends up in the lake however the places that we've been able  
**[0:15:43-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:15:43):**  to sort of uh put in check dams regenerate the areas with deep rooted crops have actually  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:15:50):**  gained that material in many cases and have been used as sort of a surplus either for  
**[0:15:55-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:15:55):**  sand for you know developing paths and other things but also a ton of soil as well yeah  
**[0:16:05-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:16:05):**  we um at the exact same time that we fenced our stream planted in 2000 trees the valley  
**[0:16:17-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:16:17):**  above us was clear cut of pine trees so we've actually had the exact same thing to us like  
**[0:16:27-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:16:27):**  we're getting increased runoff due to the clear felling of the um and so now it's like  
**[0:16:35-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:16:35):**  a race against the clock my you know my all my trees and my grass my native grasses and  
**[0:16:43-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:16:43):**  a couple of introduced species i'm ready for team broad enough before we get a big storm  
**[0:16:52-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:16:52):**  coming down the stream with all that excess runoff due to the hillsides above us no longer  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:16:59):**  being covered in trees yeah it makes a huge difference and puts the whole ecosystem at  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:17:04):**  risk frankly but now here let's move on a little bit with uh dealing with the disasters  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:17:10):**  and tell me what you focused on afterwards because you seem to be very focused towards  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:17:16):**  building and maintaining systems and models which are primarily economically viable as  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:17:21):**  well as doing good for the uh for the local ecology and the health of the ecosystem on  
**[0:17:26-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:17:26):**  your farm tell me a little bit about how you decide on that criteria and what and what  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:17:32):**  doesn't make the cut as far as the priorities of the systems that you put in it's a great  
**[0:17:38-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:17:38):**  it's a great question i mean i really see permaculture farm development as a dynamic  
**[0:17:46-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:17:46):**  process you you start out in one direction and then you might have some failures you  
**[0:17:54-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:17:54):**  might have some success that's it you you change your design you change your head but  
**[0:18:02-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:18:02):**  in the big picture for our farm to be sustainable it has to be economically and in the world  
**[0:18:10-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:18:10):**  of permaculture we see all these you know all these examples of permaculture properties  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:18:16):**  where somebody drops a million dollars brings in a bunch of earth moving equipment builds  
**[0:18:22-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:18:22):**  a fancy eco um then posted on facebook and you know gets a million likes but that's like  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:18:31):**  most people don't have a million dollars to drop on a permaculture property so what we're  
**[0:18:35-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:18:35):**  trying to do is is to find out what are the what are the agricultural systems for our  
**[0:18:47-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:18:47):**  space and maybe our local economy our soil type the um the microclimates we have yeah  
**[0:18:55-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:18:55):**  so so um you know for for farms to be viable they've got to be sustained you know financially  
**[0:19:02-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:19:02):**  sustainable nobody farms to to go bankrupt and so what we're doing is we're responding  
**[0:19:11-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:19:11):**  to what what's appropriate for our land and the the maybe the markets that are available  
**[0:19:19-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:19:19):**  to us and um at the same time making sure that we're not doing anything that's going  
**[0:19:28-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:19:28):**  to cause further damage no more slips no more erosion or just barely limiting so the the  
**[0:19:35-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:19:35):**  obvious solution to that is to plant more trees and this is this is the basis of permaculture  
**[0:19:42-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:19:42):**  the way i see it is moving more toward a permanent agriculture and so more perennials and less  
**[0:19:50-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:19:50):**  annuals also move away from a pasture-based grazing system and more toward a fodder-based  
**[0:20:00-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:20:00):**  grazing system and i'm sure you guys can relate with your goats that you know they are really  
**[0:20:07-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:20:07):**  they're browsers right so any pastured animals here in the highlands in the the rocky mountains  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:20:13):**  just wouldn't find a whole lot of food on their own and you'd have to be importing feed  
**[0:20:17-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:20:17):**  quite frankly where we are goats are really the only sustainable larger herbivore that  
**[0:20:24-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:20:24):**  i think can can do very well here without some major changes in in either the landscape  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:20:32):**  or the inputs and i'm sure that's what you found as well no yeah i mean if you standing  
**[0:20:37-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:20:37):**  standing on our hillside we look at the neighboring farms and you see a couple things one you  
**[0:20:44-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:20:44):**  see a ton of sheep and no trees planted on the hillsides or you see they they'll rotate  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:20:52):**  cattle in with the sheep so basically you're looking at really steep hillsides hardly any  
**[0:20:58-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:20:58):**  trees and either sheep or cows and you look at what we've done we experimented with sheep  
**[0:21:07-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:21:07):**  early on got rid of them we we had this image of having a house cow and would love to um  
**[0:21:14-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:21:14):**  be milking our own cows so we we bought a cow and a calf but after one really wet winter  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:21:21):**  where she was just basically skiing down the hillsides we decided that that's not the appropriate  
**[0:21:27-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:21:27):**  animal for our land and so we sold all the sheep we sold all the cows and we really decided  
**[0:21:35-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:21:35):**  that in our mission to plant more trees on the hillsides and to protect the riparian  
**[0:21:44-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:21:44):**  corridor that goats are such a better option for us because we can we can use it's basically  
**[0:21:52-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:21:52):**  chop and drop fodder yeah yeah we need it and so we run half of the farm with with goats  
**[0:22:03-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:22:03):**  and you know there's still going to be a lot of grass around there for grazing but we're  
**[0:22:09-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:22:09):**  just planting more and more trees now when you're planting trees with goats present you  
**[0:22:15-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:22:15):**  need to protect the trees so there's two ways we do that we get three meter poplar poles  
**[0:22:22-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:22:22):**  from the regional council and these are highly subsidized they they give them out to any  
**[0:22:28-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:22:28):**  farmer and we plant those three meter poplar poles 70 centimeters in the ground so on day  
**[0:22:37-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:22:37):**  one we've got a tree that's 2.3 meters tall and they also they'll sell you but we usually  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:22:46):**  use recycled ones we go to the dump and get these plastic sleeves that you put over the  
**[0:22:51-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:22:51):**  poplar pole so that the stock won't rip the bark off of it so yeah like girdling they're  
**[0:22:59-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:22:59):**  really aggressive with they've done that to a number of our avocado trees already we've  
**[0:23:03-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:23:03):**  had to take some measures against it as well yeah it's just you know goats are great but  
**[0:23:09-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:23:09):**  you know it's a goat is is a goat is to a tree what chicken is to your vegetable garden  
**[0:23:17-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:23:17):**  so that's a really appropriate system for us with the the poplar poles to hold the steep  
**[0:23:25-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:23:25):**  hillsides the plastic sleeve to protect it and then down in the riparian corridor we've  
**[0:23:33-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:23:33):**  planted willows we've just basically taken willow wands or willow poles and we've just  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:23:40):**  jammed them into the stream bank this was a real triage measure we did it almost immediately  
**[0:23:46-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:23:46):**  after the big storm then we've gotten a lot of kasarina which is australian river oak  
**[0:23:56-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:23:56):**  or sheet oak which in permaculture is known to be a superior windbreak kasarina is this  
**[0:24:03-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:24:03):**  you know you know really well known windbreak but it's also it's called river oak in australia  
**[0:24:11-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:24:11):**  because its extensive root system will hold the stream banks it's also a superior stock  
**[0:24:17-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:24:17):**  fodder so all along our riparian corridor which is fenced off from stock we're growing  
**[0:24:24-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:24:24):**  these willows in this kasarina and if if there's ever a drought a severe drought on our farm  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:24:32):**  well where's all the water during a drought it's down in the stream and with these trees  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:24:37):**  and their extensive root systems during a flood they're holding the stream bank in place  
**[0:24:42-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:24:42):**  and during a drought we're cutting the branches and just dropping them over the fence and  
**[0:24:49-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:24:49):**  that's our emergency stock fodder for the goats fantastic so now i know you also focus  
**[0:24:55-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:24:55):**  a lot on what you would call four-dimensional design especially turning liabilities into  
**[0:25:01-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:25:01):**  assets can you explain what the fourth dimension is in this case and why it's so it's absolutely  
**[0:25:08-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:25:08):**  essential to include in the design process and how the transformation of those liabilities  
**[0:25:14-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:25:14):**  into assets have worked out in your experience yeah time is the fourth dimension and i think  
**[0:25:24-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:25:24):**  it's a little bit of a misnomer in in people just learning about permaculture that oh you  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:25:33):**  know permaculture is a no maintenance um system oh you just you just establish the system  
**[0:25:39-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:25:39):**  and then it takes care of itself um you know for one um you know regular human interactions  
**[0:25:49-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:25:49):**  are important to guide the system and maybe to have to enter intervene and change parts  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:25:55):**  of the system and the other thing is that unless you have a million dollars you can't  
**[0:26:00-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:26:00):**  afford to do everything up front you've got to pick and choose to do things over time  
**[0:26:07-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:26:07):**  so we we run a permaculture internship on the farm and probably the thing i say most  
**[0:26:16-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:26:16):**  to our interns is i'm constantly talking about four-dimensional design and about turning  
**[0:26:23-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:26:23):**  liabilities into assets so here's an example we um there's some places where we've got  
**[0:26:33-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:26:33):**  a lot of like let's say our wind breaks are too thick or there's a lot of trees growing  
**[0:26:40-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:26:40):**  or growing around the house and it's holding moisture near the house so in that case that  
**[0:26:47-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:26:47):**  if the if the if there's too much foliage and vegetation or around your orchard for  
**[0:26:54-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:26:54):**  example there's not enough airflow so you need to thin some of those branches or some  
**[0:27:01-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:27:01):**  of those trees in that case that that's a liability so what we do is we when we cut  
**[0:27:08-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:27:08):**  the branches we carry them out and feed them to the goats well now the goats eat the eat  
**[0:27:14-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:27:14):**  the leaves and they'll strip some of the bark they're really happy doing that then we've  
**[0:27:22-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:27:22):**  got a big pile of branches and those branches in the winter time we can turn them into kindling  
**[0:27:29-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:27:29):**  to start the wood fire or otherwise we we're building this giant kugel mount because we've  
**[0:27:38-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:27:38):**  got pretty poor our soil and for the most part is poorly drained so we're building this  
**[0:27:46-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:27:46):**  sort of island where we're just putting branches and branches and branches then later on this  
**[0:27:52-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:27:52):**  year we're going to build a small a small what's called a dependent dwelling on the  
**[0:27:59-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:27:59):**  farm and when we do the groundwork for that we're going to take all the topsoil and put  
**[0:28:03-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:28:03):**  it on top of those branches and our hugel mount so and this all takes place over time  
**[0:28:10-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:28:10):**  you know one one joke i tell my interns is it takes me a month to cut a tree down because  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:28:17):**  i only cut one branch a day and i feed it to the goats and the next day i cut another  
**[0:28:21-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:28:21):**  branch and i feed the goats so you know it may take me four weeks to cut that entire  
**[0:28:27-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:28:27):**  tree down but the goats are getting fresh food every single day and then and then you  
**[0:28:35-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:28:35):**  know once they've eaten all of that then the branches and twigs another purpose and the  
**[0:28:42-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:28:42):**  tree trunk is cut down and that's dried and used for firewood everything is staggered  
**[0:28:46-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:28:46):**  and staged so you've got to have a real clear idea of of the steps of the process and so  
**[0:28:55-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:28:55):**  yeah turning those liabilities into assets over time working smarter rather than working  
**[0:29:02-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:29:02):**  harder lets you do things dirt cheap and your your farm punches above its weight because  
**[0:29:09-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:29:09):**  you know there's no such thing as a liability if you can if you see what bill mollison would  
**[0:29:17-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:29:17):**  say the problem is the solution yeah absolutely and that's a fantastic illustration of how  
**[0:29:24-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:29:24):**  turning a task into kind of a multiple win process rather than just going through the  
**[0:29:31-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:29:31):**  conventional way doing it quickly and possibly using machinery or other things to do it faster  
**[0:29:38-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:29:38):**  with this extended process that feeds into other aspects of your systems you're accomplishing  
**[0:29:45-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:29:45):**  actually a lot more even if the the main task at hand is taking longer yeah absolutely i'll  
**[0:29:51-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:29:51):**  give you one more quick example which feeds into you know once you start talking about  
**[0:29:57-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:29:57):**  a holistically designed farm everything connects to everything now in our goal of drought proofing  
**[0:30:04-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:30:04):**  and flood proofing the farm we've put in a small pond very high on the property it's  
**[0:30:13-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:30:13):**  about 25 000 liters five meters by five meters by one meter deep and what we did is we dug  
**[0:30:24-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:30:24):**  it by hand that way we were able to carefully take all of the top soil off and put it over  
**[0:30:32-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:30:32):**  in our orchard where we wanted the fruit trees to have a little bit better drainage then  
**[0:30:39-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:30:39):**  with the clay underneath not far away we had a there was a drain along one of our major  
**[0:30:50-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:30:50):**  farm tracks which was below a pretty steep slope with our 25 000 liter concrete water  
**[0:31:00-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:31:00):**  tank for the house so we've got this giant water tank on a slope above a drain above  
**[0:31:08-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:31:08):**  a track now that's a recipe for disaster so what i did is i put i took a hundred mil 10  
**[0:31:20-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:31:20):**  centimeter wide plastic coil drain laid that in the bottom of our drain connected it to  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:31:29):**  a sump up at the top so it won't get blocked with a sump with a grate over it then we back  
**[0:31:35-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:31:35):**  filled we brought that clay down one wheelbarrow at a time and we then we back filled the drain  
**[0:31:42-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:31:42):**  so it was so we turned the slope just above the drain we gently we made it a gentler slope  
**[0:31:52-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:31:52):**  and we so it's still serving as a drain but there's not as much pressure coming down on  
**[0:32:01-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:32:01):**  that steep slope so that it's protecting our water tank above it's protecting our track  
**[0:32:09-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:32:09):**  below and when you're digging a pond all the soil inside of the pond is a liability it  
**[0:32:15-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:32:15):**  has to be moved then you find the most appropriate place to put it so the topsoil yep we'll put  
**[0:32:22-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:32:22):**  that in the orchard and the clay will use it to stabilize this other bank then that  
**[0:32:28-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:32:28):**  becomes an asset and if you want interns to really understand four-dimensional design  
**[0:32:38-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:32:38):**  there's nothing better than digging a pond in that way because it's experiential learning  
**[0:32:42-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:32:42):**  you're really seeing this is the thought that goes behind it and we're moving you know we're  
**[0:32:49-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:32:49):**  moving the soil for one place to another and we're making both systems more robust so we're  
**[0:32:57-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:32:57):**  getting two or three outcomes from one job yeah absolutely that's a fantastic illustration  
**[0:33:04-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:33:04):**  now i know that you mentioned that you had a number of different animals on the farm  
**[0:33:08-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:33:08):**  all for production i assume and i'm fascinated by hearing all of the different ways that  
**[0:33:14-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:33:14):**  people in the permaculture community have integrated multiple animals in order to make  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:33:21):**  the best use of all of their products and their byproducts could you talk a little bit  
**[0:33:25-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:33:25):**  about the animal systems that you've implemented yeah so we've talked a bit about the goat  
**[0:33:30-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:33:30):**  system and the goats for us the goats are primarily about milk because we you know we  
**[0:33:41-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:33:41):**  our family eats lots of dairy and we we much rather be producing that milk ourselves and  
**[0:33:52-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:33:52):**  then meat as well you know we we take the most of the billy goats end up in the freezer  
**[0:33:59-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:33:59):**  but they're also doing you know they are a resilient animal because during a drought  
**[0:34:05-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:34:05):**  when all the grass dies off they can happily eat the branches of trees so the next real  
**[0:34:13-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:34:13):**  really really interesting system we've got interesting to some of your listeners is we  
**[0:34:22-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:34:22):**  integrate kuni kuni pigs into a system again a tree-based system kuni kuni pigs are from  
**[0:34:31-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:34:31):**  what i understand the only breed of pig that can survive purely on good pasture and we  
**[0:34:40-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:34:40):**  use initially we're using the kuni kuni as lawn mowers because fruit trees especially  
**[0:34:48-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:34:48):**  when they're getting established don't like competition from grass and we don't want to  
**[0:34:54-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:34:54):**  be out there cutting the grass constantly so on the other half of the farm so we've  
**[0:35:00-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:35:00):**  got we're managing one one half of the valley with the goats and the other half of the valley  
**[0:35:06-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:35:06):**  we're managing with pigs and in both cases we're planting the hillsides up so in the  
**[0:35:16-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:35:16):**  kuni kuni pig system we've planted the entire hillside to olives because it's a it's a windy  
**[0:35:23-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:35:23):**  hot slope and we know olives don't mind those conditions they'll help to hold the hillside  
**[0:35:31-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:35:31):**  and prevent slips and then just below that we've got a bit of a plateau above the stream  
**[0:35:40-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:35:40):**  and it's the only place on the entire property with free draining soil so this is where we're  
**[0:35:45-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:35:45):**  going to plant our avocados and and the the idea is that the pigs will graze underneath  
**[0:35:54-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:35:54):**  the avocados keep the grass down and they'll graze underneath the olives on another part  
**[0:36:00-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:36:00):**  of the hill we've planted a bunch of drought party new zealand native trees called aki  
**[0:36:06-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:36:06):**  aki and aki aki means forever and ever it's the hardest hardwood in new zealand and traditionally  
**[0:36:15-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:36:15):**  mauri have used it for handles to tools and so ultimately we'll be able to be growing  
**[0:36:22-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:36:22):**  all of our own handles for our garden tools meanwhile simultaneously we're protecting  
**[0:36:29-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:36:29):**  the slopes from from erosion i'll tell you a bit of a heartbreaking story we've been  
**[0:36:37-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:36:37):**  planting tagasaste growing tagasaste from seed tree looser to act as a nurse crop for  
**[0:36:45-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:36:45):**  the avocados because avocados are a forest tree and when they're young they need to be  
**[0:36:51-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:36:51):**  protected from sunburn and also from frosts so i fenced off this this little plateau so  
**[0:37:00-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:37:00):**  the pigs wouldn't go in there i planted 200 tagasaste that i had raised from seed then  
**[0:37:09-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:37:09):**  we went uh overseas to visit family and i came back and a hare had eaten 197 of my 200  
**[0:37:20-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:37:20):**  tagasaste seedlings and i was just absolutely gutted and this is what farming is it's just  
**[0:37:28-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:37:28):**  heartbreak after heartbreak the best intentions and even worse we had we had covered all of  
**[0:37:37-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:37:37):**  them with hair repellent already we've got this little recipe where you take eggs and  
**[0:37:43-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:37:43):**  pva glue and chili powder and blood and bone and you mixed up this absolutely and then  
**[0:37:53-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:37:53):**  you sprinkle it over the foliage and it's supposed to deter hairs and rabbits so we  
**[0:37:59-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:37:59):**  even did that and still the hairs went in and killed almost all of the tagasaste um  
**[0:38:06-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:38:06):**  oh man those things can be really aggressive so it's it's been so now i have to decide  
**[0:38:12-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:38:12):**  do i want to plant these avocados out without that protection i'll just have to paint the  
**[0:38:17-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:38:17):**  trunks white um or am i going to have to grow up a whole other crop of tagasaste wait another  
**[0:38:25-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:38:25):**  six or eight months before planting out the olives and meanwhile the olives are in pots  
**[0:38:30-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:38:30):**  and they don't like being in pots because they need really good drainage and so i'm  
**[0:38:36-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:38:36):**  up again i'm racing against the clock to get this system in place but ultimately it'll  
**[0:38:42-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:38:42):**  be an avocado olive and kuni kuni pig system managing you know that that you know all basically  
**[0:38:53-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:38:53):**  as perennial food crops and protecting this the stream bank and the hillside at the same  
**[0:39:00-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:39:00):**  time that is fascinating i really wish i could come and see that system i have not been able  
**[0:39:08-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:39:08):**  to get to new zealand since i first started traveling probably back in 2007 and that place  
**[0:39:14-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:39:14):**  really left a mark on me and i could just imagine how beautiful all of these symbiotic  
**[0:39:20-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:39:20):**  systems are with it as well now moving aside and more towards the production more of the  
**[0:39:29-0:39:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:39:29):**  economics of these systems you do a lot of things and have quite a bit of diversity on  
**[0:39:34-0:39:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:39:34):**  this farm everything from market gardening you've got stone and pip fruits you sell plant  
**[0:39:39-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:39:39):**  seedlings you've got all of those animals which we just talked about and you do rest  
**[0:39:43-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:39:43):**  of restoration work along your riparian zones how do you balance the diversity with the  
**[0:39:52-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:39:52):**  economic needs of remaining sustainable within the business aspect of this enterprise it's  
**[0:39:59-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:39:59):**  a great question now this is the podcast that i i've heard you guys talking about and that  
**[0:40:05-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:40:05):**  sort of you know motivated me to reach out to you guys because it is you know it's all  
**[0:40:11-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:40:11):**  about balancing those things now we've got a couple of things going for us if you start  
**[0:40:19-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:40:19):**  from a place of market gardening you can get up running really quickly and um i've been  
**[0:40:26-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:40:26):**  growing sure just because of the higher turnover crops that you're using in that context yeah  
**[0:40:31-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:40:31):**  yeah um even before we took possession of this farm we took possession in the middle  
**[0:40:37-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:40:37):**  of winter oh sorry late winter and traditionally in in new zealand garlic is planted on the  
**[0:40:45-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:40:45):**  winter solstice which for us is june 21st we didn't take possession of the farm until  
**[0:40:51-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:40:51):**  august 1st so i got permission from the woman we bought it from to come basically on july  
**[0:40:58-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:40:58):**  1st and plant a crop of garlic on the land a month before we even took possession and  
**[0:41:07-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:41:07):**  really high quality organic garlic it's a niche product which i've been growing for  
**[0:41:14-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:41:14):**  you know 15 20 years and um i know that people you know foodies will pay good money for it  
**[0:41:23-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:41:23):**  um and so that was a way for us to get up and running straight away my my day job which  
**[0:41:31-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:41:31):**  i stumbled across quite accidentally is i advise people on building and renovating energy  
**[0:41:40-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:41:40):**  efficient homes and the the only reason that i've got this job is because i've i've renovated  
**[0:41:49-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:41:49):**  a lot of homes to a really high energy efficiency standard i have no training as a builder or  
**[0:41:55-0:42:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:41:55):**  an architect but we call it eco thrifty renovation um and so i'm lucky to have to have a really  
**[0:42:07-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:42:07):**  fulfilling job off the farm which helps us pace ourselves on the farm but even if you  
**[0:42:15-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:42:15):**  don't even if you don't have a job off the farm um you still need to pace yourself and  
**[0:42:23-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:42:23):**  this is what i picked up from the podcast i listened to you guys as well you've got  
**[0:42:29-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:42:29):**  to you've you've got to chip away at it and you might spend a little bit of time developing  
**[0:42:39-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:42:39):**  an economic enterprise and then you might pour some of those profits into restoration  
**[0:42:46-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:42:46):**  work and then go back and put a little bit more effort into an economic enterprise so  
**[0:42:56-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:42:56):**  you know we've planted 200 250 fruit trees but those will take a couple years to get  
**[0:43:03-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:43:03):**  established and so meanwhile we're doing we're doing the market gardening and you know the  
**[0:43:13-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:43:13):**  i tell people the avocado orchard it's my retirement fund because at the moment avocados  
**[0:43:20-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:43:20):**  are are you know they were selling for up to four or five dollars a piece here um so  
**[0:43:27-0:43:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:43:27):**  i really see that as a as a very viable income and if the if the kunnikunis are managing  
**[0:43:34-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:43:34):**  the grass it's going to be a fairly low input system but absolutely this is where four-dimensional  
**[0:43:40-0:43:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:43:40):**  design comes in take your time and and find out what systems are suit your land but also  
**[0:43:50-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:43:50):**  suit you when i'm consulting clients i tell them you know we think we talk about um energy  
**[0:43:58-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:43:58):**  flows we you know we're talking about sector analysis we look at sun angles and wind and  
**[0:44:04-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:44:04):**  water i tell people the most important energy flow is you because if you get burnt out or  
**[0:44:12-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:44:12):**  if you if if growing that certain crop doesn't suit you or if your daily pattern doesn't  
**[0:44:19-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:44:19):**  take you through that part of the farm or that part of your suburban section you know  
**[0:44:25-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:44:25):**  you need to redesign it um because ultimately you know the whole section you know the the  
**[0:44:33-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:44:33):**  the success or failure of any of any farm or um small even suburban permaculture property  
**[0:44:42-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:44:42):**  it's the human beings who are interacting it so you need to make the design suit the  
**[0:44:47-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:44:47):**  people along with suiting the climate and the landscape and the local economy as well  
**[0:44:53-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:44:53):**  yeah those are absolutely essential observations i know that's something that we work really  
**[0:44:57-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:44:57):**  hard on when we design with clients as well especially those who have a priority towards  
**[0:45:02-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:45:02):**  perennial systems and i mean obviously we always try and move any landscape or land  
**[0:45:08-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:45:08):**  enterprise towards a more perennial system eventually but you really have to have a plan  
**[0:45:14-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:45:14):**  for how you're going to bring in income until those systems mature unless you've got like  
**[0:45:20-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:45:20):**  a trust fund or another source of income to rely on in that period which could be five  
**[0:45:25-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:45:25):**  to seven years especially in your case with avocados um that's usually way too long of  
**[0:45:31-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:45:31):**  a period of time to not be making at least a sustainable income and so how we work towards  
**[0:45:38-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:45:38):**  you know those high turnover annual annuals like you talked about in a market garden and  
**[0:45:43-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:45:43):**  slowly start putting in the perennial systems the long-term systems that quite frankly are  
**[0:45:48-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:45:48):**  a lot easier and more passive to manage once they mature though they do take quite a bit  
**[0:45:52-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:45:52):**  of effort to get established i mean it's different with every single context and i really like  
**[0:45:58-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:45:58):**  what you mentioned about how the person interacting with the systems more often be it the designer  
**[0:46:03-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:46:03):**  the owner or the primary worker being the major energy source and while all those other  
**[0:46:09-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:46:09):**  ones are just as important as you mentioned if the primary interacting force on that piece  
**[0:46:15-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:46:15):**  of land is not either interested motivated or able to take care of however ideal um a  
**[0:46:24-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:46:24):**  landscape system it might be it's going to fall apart and i really appreciate you you  
**[0:46:29-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:46:29):**  highlighting that for that reason yeah um i've i've made a lot of mistakes i've gotten  
**[0:46:37-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:46:37):**  myself in over my head in the past for example you know i was really keen to do beads you  
**[0:46:44-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:46:44):**  know like 15 16 years ago back when i had my farm in america and the first winter my  
**[0:46:53-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:46:53):**  bees died and the second winter i managed to overwinter my bees and they survived and  
**[0:47:01-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:47:01):**  in the spring a bear came along and smashed my hives oh no and now that on our farm in  
**[0:47:09-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:47:09):**  new zealand i just have a contractor come in and do the bees for me um i like him a  
**[0:47:16-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:47:16):**  lot he's got a four-wheel drive vehicle which i don't have and so you know he he does the  
**[0:47:23-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:47:23):**  bees he pays us a leasing fee he gives us honey his bees pollinate all of our trees  
**[0:47:30-0:47:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:47:30):**  and a couple months ago i needed a hand um i asked him if he could help me move some  
**[0:47:36-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:47:36):**  things around the farm and he shows up on a saturday morning with his five-year-old  
**[0:47:40-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:47:40):**  son and you know he had we had to move a pig shelter down into the valley and then on the  
**[0:47:47-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:47:47):**  way back up we had a big pile of firewood we threw it in the back of his truck and we  
**[0:47:51-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:47:51):**  drove back up and so you know to me permaculture to a certain extent is about mutually beneficial  
**[0:47:57-0:48:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:47:57):**  relationships we're designing for always designing for mutually beneficial relationships so i  
**[0:48:04-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:48:04):**  see my relationship with my beekeeper as as great he's getting he's getting access to  
**[0:48:11-0:48:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:48:11):**  land which he doesn't own land but he owns a business i need pollination i need um you  
**[0:48:19-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:48:19):**  know we love to eat honey as well and he's a nice guy and he's willing to help me out  
**[0:48:25-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:48:25):**  you know when i need a hand yeah exactly increasing the connections especially the beneficial  
**[0:48:30-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:48:30):**  ones stacking functions like that there are so many ways to do it that aren't maybe directly  
**[0:48:35-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:48:35):**  linked to the to the land itself but spill out over into the communities and the connections  
**[0:48:41-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:48:41):**  with people and i agree that's one of the most fascinating things that are often overlooked  
**[0:48:46-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:48:46):**  when we focus too much just on the farming aspect yeah we also um along with our permaculture  
**[0:48:54-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:48:54):**  internship which is eight weeks long um we're getting inquiries from all over the world  
**[0:49:00-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:49:00):**  we're getting interns coming they get a pdc over the course of eight weeks and they're  
**[0:49:06-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:49:06):**  living it they're living four-dimensional design thinking on the farm we also we try  
**[0:49:13-0:49:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:49:13):**  to run one workshop every month on the farm for the local community and we're just starting  
**[0:49:21-0:49:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:49:21):**  what sort of could be called a forest kindergarten um where you know these have been around in  
**[0:49:28-0:49:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:49:28):**  europe for 30 years 40 years where we're building we're bringing children onto the farm and  
**[0:49:35-0:49:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:49:35):**  primarily they go down to zone five and they have unstructured discovery play which is  
**[0:49:44-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:49:44):**  shown to be best practice early childhood education but they also come and they and  
**[0:49:50-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:49:50):**  they can bottle feed the goats or they can see the baby piglets or they can hold a baby  
**[0:49:54-0:50:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:49:54):**  duckling um you know they're more and more and more urban and suburban kids never spend  
**[0:50:02-0:50:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:50:02):**  time in nature and never spend time on a farm so it's really important both of those things  
**[0:50:08-0:50:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:50:08):**  for for people to understand what it's like to be on a farm and to understand that yes  
**[0:50:14-0:50:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:50:14):**  animals are raised and killed for food um and to spend that time discovering nature  
**[0:50:23-0:50:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:50:23):**  in a zone five and that's another way that we're reaching out to the community and even  
**[0:50:30-0:50:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:50:30):**  it's a tiny income stream for us really really tiny but we're building social capital you  
**[0:50:38-0:50:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:50:38):**  know the social capital we build by opening the farm is so much more valuable than any  
**[0:50:44-0:50:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:50:44):**  any financial return we would get absolutely i agree with that wholeheartedly now there's  
**[0:50:51-0:50:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:50:51):**  one quote that i've heard from you which i would really love to sort of unpack because  
**[0:50:55-0:51:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:50:55):**  it's very valuable and you said we're farming as if our children's lives depend on it can  
**[0:51:02-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:51:02):**  you reiterate or or explain a little bit the urgency and the motivation that drives you  
**[0:51:07-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:51:07):**  to do what you do for the next generation yeah i mean going back to 1986 where i was  
**[0:51:17-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:51:17):**  in my very first university lecture and it just scared the shit out of me and here we  
**[0:51:23-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:51:23):**  are 32 years later and i've spent my entire adult life as an environmental educator and  
**[0:51:33-0:51:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:51:33):**  i've basically failed right i have i've failed to save the world um and so um the best i  
**[0:51:42-0:51:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:51:42):**  can do i think is to prepare my children's future to be as resilient as possible and  
**[0:51:52-0:52:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:51:52):**  i'm on our farm i'm i tell my interns all the time i'm in this for the long for the  
**[0:52:02-0:52:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:52:02):**  long term for the long haul um if i'm i'm totally willing to forego short-term farm  
**[0:52:11-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:52:11):**  profits for long-term farm resilience and building robust systems and it takes time  
**[0:52:21-0:52:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:52:21):**  to do that and essentially i want to set my children up to be to be on a farm that is  
**[0:52:29-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:52:29):**  extremely resilient and robust if they choose to be farming you know we just look at the  
**[0:52:37-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:52:37):**  news of climate change this in the last six months forest fires in sweden um super storms  
**[0:52:47-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:52:47):**  i just saw a headline this morning there are nine major storms over the world's oceans  
**[0:52:54-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:52:54):**  right now um and so we are we are drought proofing and flood proofing because if we  
**[0:53:01-0:53:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:53:01):**  lose any more soil farming won't even be viable for my children and and so that's why i yeah  
**[0:53:10-0:53:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:53:10):**  i'm i'm putting them first and foremost and it's a win-win because you know we'll have  
**[0:53:18-0:53:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:53:18):**  a more robust farm long term and who when all the other farms around us have been degraded  
**[0:53:27-0:53:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:53:27):**  by soil loss um will become you know our our land quote unquote would become more valuable  
**[0:53:34-0:53:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:53:34):**  but more importantly the farmer is going to look over the fence and say hey um i used  
**[0:53:40-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-nelson-lebo/#t=0:53:40):**  to make fun of you for doing what you're doing but now actually i want to come and learn

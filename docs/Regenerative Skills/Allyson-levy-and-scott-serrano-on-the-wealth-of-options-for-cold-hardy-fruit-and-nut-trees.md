**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:03:20):**  propagation and managing even the business side.

**[0:03:45-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:03:45):**  Alison and Scott, thanks so much for taking time to be here.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:03:48):**  I'm really curious to know how you got started from what seems like a one acre hobby garden  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:03:54):**  and a plant collection into what is now an eight acre botanical garden and a nursery.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:03:59):**  What's the evolution of that?  
**[0:04:01-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:04:01):**  You want me to take that?  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:04:04):**  So thank you for having us on and wanting to learn a little bit more about what we're  
**[0:04:09-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:04:09):**  doing in our backstory.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:04:11):**  So I'll try and be succinct, but it's a little bit rambling.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:04:15):**  We moved to the Hudson Valley from San Francisco about 23 years ago.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:04:21):**  And as we like to say, when we lived in San Francisco, we were very close to what is what  
**[0:04:27-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:04:27):**  was then called the Striving Arboretum.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:04:30):**  It's now the Striving Botanical Garden.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:04:32):**  So we use that as a playground backyard area because we had a small child.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:04:37):**  So we spent a lot of time there.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:04:39):**  And we didn't have a yard.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:04:40):**  And we didn't have a new yard.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:04:41):**  It was a typical, well, it wasn't a typical San Francisco situation.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:04:45):**  Some places have yards, but it was an apartment.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:04:48):**  But we were super fortunate.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:04:50):**  And when we essentially moved here in 1999, we had a house that was falling apart and  
**[0:04:59-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:04:59):**  three acres of land.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:05:01):**  And I think immediately our interest was because we had maybe 95% lawn.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:05:09):**  The rest 5% were like boxwood and forsythia.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:05:13):**  And Scott and I quickly were like, okay, we wanted to start planting.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:05:19):**  And Scott was very clear.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:05:21):**  He wanted to start planting at least berry bushes.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:05:24):**  But we also are visual artists.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:05:27):**  We both work currently in what loosely called botanical art.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:05:31):**  But back then, Scott was doing lots of artworks based on insects.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:05:37):**  So he began planting plants that would attract a certain type of moth or caterpillar, whatever  
**[0:05:48-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:05:48):**  he was studying at the time.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:05:49):**  And then I was looking for plants that had interesting seed pods, interesting flower petals.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:05:57):**  And so we continued doing that among putting in some, you know, we put in the mulberry  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:06:03):**  and peaches, things that we were aware about.

**[0:06:13-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:06:13):**  much as we thought we could on this three-acre site that had a lot of shade from some existing  
**[0:06:20-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:06:20):**  large trees.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:06:23):**  And about two years into living here, we learned that a one-acre parcel, that we weren't fully  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:06:30):**  using our three acres of land.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:06:33):**  And that there was an additional about an acre of land that was in what we would call  
**[0:06:38-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:06:38):**  back then full sun.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:06:40):**  But we know better now.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:06:41):**  It was more somewhere between anywhere from six to 10 hours of light.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:06:48):**  But it was so much better.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:06:50):**  So we were like thrilled to have a whole nother area to start just putting in even more fruit  
**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:06:56):**  trees.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:06:58):**  And there became a point in time very shortly after where my story is that I felt Scott  
**[0:07:04-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:07:04):**  and I were putting in the same plants.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:07:07):**  And we were a young family.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:07:08):**  We didn't have any money.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:07:09):**  I said we're artists.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:07:10):**  And it was just like Scott, we can't put the same thing in.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:07:14):**  We got to really think about what we're doing.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:07:16):**  And that became kind of the beginning of being super conscious about planting for diversity.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:07:24):**  So we might be interested in putting salvias, but let's not put the same salvia in.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:07:29):**  Let's look for all the different species.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:07:32):**  And then that kind of evolved into expanding what we knew about with fruiting trees.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:07:39):**  So in that garden, we started experimenting and putting in plants like medlar, shipova,  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:07:47):**  we did pawpaws, persimmons, and we just read as much as we could.  
**[0:07:52-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:07:52):**  And we did a lot of, you know, killing things because not fully knowing what a plant needed,  
**[0:08:00-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:08:00):**  not fully knowing about what that site was.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:08:03):**  So that site had a lot of clay in it.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:08:07):**  And it took us a little while to figure out, oh, okay, persimmons don't mind that, but  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:08:13):**  medlar does or shipova, like it was a lot of just figuring things out.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:08:19):**  And then over time, we filled that area up and kind of fast forward a little bit.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:08:26):**  But in 2009, a parcel across the road from where we are, became available.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:08:34):**  And we asked the owner, would they be willing to split it up?  
**[0:08:38-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:08:38):**  It was a large, it was about 18 acres.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:08:40):**  And again, we didn't have a lot of money, but I actually had a big art sale, we put  
**[0:08:45-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:08:45):**  a deposit down, and we slowly began to plan how to take care of what was a, you know,  
**[0:08:52-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:08:52):**  a young forested area.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:08:54):**  And by that we brought in a lumberjack.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:08:57):**  He came in, we marked trees, he brought all the lumber away, but he left a mess, like  
**[0:09:04-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:09:04):**  all the crowns.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:09:06):**  It was a mess.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:09:07):**  But because we at this point, we had been planting for a while, 10 years, I guess, we  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:09:13):**  knew it was best to get plants in the ground now.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:09:17):**  And we'll worry about the cleanup once we get the plants that we want in.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:09:22):**  And then we were not going to put them in just willy nilly, so to speak, we decided,  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:09:29):**  let's have a design and plan.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:09:32):**  And that's where we, I would say it's the most, now all the gardens are becoming more  
**[0:09:36-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:09:36):**  organized.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:09:37):**  But in the beginning, that became in 2009, okay, let's have a nut grove, let's have a  
**[0:09:42-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:09:42):**  prunus area, this is where the greenhouse will be.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:09:45):**  Oh, let's have a native section, a China section.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:09:48):**  So that was really like, to condense how you condense 23 years, that was really the start.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:09:56):**  And then last year, we were lucky enough, I say lucky enough, because we thwarted a  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:10:02):**  building project that would have put a couple more houses right against the Arboretum.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:10:07):**  So we were able to purchase 10 acres of land.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:10:10):**  So we're currently 21 acres, five acres, we think are really full, five to six are fully  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:10:19):**  cultivated and continue to be.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:10:22):**  And she's skipping at one point in the middle of all of that.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:10:26):**  I think I it was either the Brooklyn Botanical Garden or the New York Botanical Garden, we  
**[0:10:32-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:10:32):**  went there.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:10:33):**  And I stood in the middle of that and said, Oh, this is where I want a house, I want to  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:10:37):**  have dropped here.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:10:41):**  Except I would have fruit trees mixed with all of this.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:10:44):**  So I could pick fruit off it at the same time.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:10:47):**  And then I say, and so that's basically what we did, we did the opposite.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:10:51):**  We took a house and we build an Arboretum around it.  
**[0:10:54-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:10:54):**  And we got accreditation with the Morton Arboretum Registry, there's a certain amount of paperwork  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:11:01):**  you fill out and you list online all the plants you grow so that Arboretums from around the  
**[0:11:07-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:11:07):**  world can check on it.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:11:08):**  And we began to systematically label our plants, because we sort of stole Arnold Arboretum's  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:11:14):**  method of how they label, I looked at their plant labels, and I attempted to kind of reproduce  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:11:19):**  in a way that we could afford.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:11:22):**  And I experimented with hand stamping and we eventually settled on a dog tag maker,  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:11:27):**  a machine that hand stamps out dog tags so that you have six or seven rows of texts where  
**[0:11:32-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:11:32):**  you could say everything you know about a tree.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:11:35):**  And then the most, and then we began to organize our, our plants systematically and try to  
**[0:11:41-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:11:41):**  build the kind of a conscious collection.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:11:43):**  I always say the difference between a nice garden and an Arboretum is kind of an attempt  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:11:48):**  to kind of represent biodiversity and to try to expand and to do it systematically.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:11:53):**  And then it's that how it's presented to the public who comes to visit your garden is what  
**[0:11:58-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:11:58):**  makes it an Arboretum.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:12:00):**  So the last biggest iteration is that is somebody who is visiting our garden said, I bet I could  
**[0:12:07-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:12:07):**  write you a grant and get you a grant.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:12:10):**  What do you want to grant for?

**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:12:13):**  So when people come here, they can see things because we have endangered species and people

**[0:12:26-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:12:26):**  Yes last year.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:12:28):**  And we got, we built 250 educational signs.

**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:12:39):**  a delivery from a sign making company, we finally got the big ones, which are four foot

**[0:12:56-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:12:56):**  of what the flowers look like.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:12:58):**  So if they come here, when magnolias are not flowering, they can say, oh, that's what the

**[0:13:04-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:13:04):**  And that's what that species look like.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:13:07):**  So that's what it literally just this morning, just arrived our truck with our sign, our  
**[0:13:11-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:13:11):**  last sign.

**[0:13:13-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:13:13):**  exciting.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:13:14):**  Good timing.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:13:15):**  Yeah, look, there's one thing that you said in the iteration of all of this is that the  
**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:13:20):**  one thing you would have changed about having planted your house right in the middle of  
**[0:13:23-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:13:23):**  an arboretum was that you wanted to have fruit trees in there.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:13:26):**  And that really comes to the book that you've recently put out, which is really specific  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:13:30):**  to the growing zones that you have, and the challenges of cultivating fruit and nut trees  
**[0:13:36-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:13:36):**  in a cold climate.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:13:38):**  So let's start from the beginning and figure out what you define as a cold climate, because  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:13:43):**  I'm betting this is based on hardiness zones, right?  
**[0:13:46-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:13:46):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:13:48):**  And hardiness can be a lot of different things.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:13:51):**  It's obviously how cold it is, but also is how how your winter is.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:13:56):**  If you get cold, but you have two feet of snow on the ground, the roots of trees are  
**[0:14:00-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:14:00):**  protected because a lot of people don't know that snow is an insulator because the ground  
**[0:14:08-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:14:08):**  tends to be median temperature about 55 degrees, whatever it is, and the layer between the  
**[0:14:15-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:14:15):**  snow and your ground warms up slightly from decaying plant material, rotting, releasing  
**[0:14:23-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:14:23):**  gases.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:14:24):**  That's why voles and field mice live under there and tunnel around.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:14:27):**  That creates a slight warm blanket thrown over.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:14:31):**  So that's another factor.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:14:32):**  It's not just how cold it is.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:14:34):**  It's what kind of winter you have.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:14:36):**  So when you have below zero temperatures, you want snow on the ground.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:14:40):**  When there's no snow on the ground, it's much more difficult to grow things.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:14:44):**  There are areas like us that when more desert like conditions, but are like us.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:14:51):**  And so when they go through below zero, they don't have any snow insulation.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:14:55):**  So they have much less options in terms of that.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:15:00):**  But then it's also sometimes like this winter for the first month, month and a half, we  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:15:07):**  were still planting outside almost until January.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:15:10):**  But then we had an ice storm where there was a half an inch to an inch of ice coating all  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:15:17):**  the trees for the first time in like 50 years, over 50 years, and we devastating, we lost  
**[0:15:21-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:15:21):**  thousands of trees in the forest.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:15:23):**  They broke and fell down.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:15:25):**  And so that one event was worse than like all the last 20 years we've grown, did more  
**[0:15:30-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:15:30):**  damage to things.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:15:32):**  Luckily, our collection was okay.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:15:33):**  But the trees in the forest in our area suffered major amounts of damage.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:15:39):**  And cold hardiness is a stretchy word.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:15:42):**  So we're already getting we've, we've always gotten comments like cold hardy where you  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:15:46):**  are, I'm in zone three, let's talk about what cold is.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:15:50):**  And it's true, it is a relative work.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:15:53):**  Just like we're a little bit envious for people who are in zone seven, because the what they  
**[0:15:58-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:15:58):**  can grow or, you know, seven be the palette seems to open up.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:16:04):**  But at the same time, there's, you know, plenty of plants that prefer to have more coldness.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:16:12):**  Maple trees would be one, one example that as climate change continues, whether you believe  
**[0:16:19-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:16:19):**  in it or not, it's happening.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:16:22):**  We know just from our time here that our USDA zonal hardiness has changed because every

**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:16:32):**  So when we moved here, we were, I believe a solid five.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:16:37):**  And now we're, you know, the temps have reached to a zone six.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:16:42):**  So we do try and be mindful about what's what we call cold hardy.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:16:50):**  With this book, initially, our focus first was on low maintenance plants.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:16:57):**  So that is really like before a title was thought up, we wanted to share with people  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:17:04):**  our experiences over two decades of growing a variety of different plants.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:17:10):**  And we grow more than 50, obviously, in our garden, but we we chose what we thought a  
**[0:17:15-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:17:15):**  combination of some very popular ones that are in the food forest permaculture world.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:17:23):**  Someone's people haven't heard about chocolate berry and maybe even star Sparilla.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:17:31):**  So that was really our focus.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:17:34):**  And a lot of people don't realize that every plant that we talked about, we've been growing

**[0:28:07-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:28:07):**  And I think even for people who get a tree or two, they're so surprised that they have

**[0:28:47-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:28:47):**  killed it twice the third time.

**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:29:10):**  But when you read about it, it doesn't, you know, depending on what you're reading, and  
**[0:29:15-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:29:15):**  a lot of times what we found just in our research for the book is that the same things are regurgitated

**[0:29:29-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:29:29):**  So Scott transplanted it twice or once?  
**[0:29:33-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:29:33):**  It was in full sunlight, right?  
**[0:29:35-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:29:35):**  And it got fried, despite being watered constantly and heavily mulched.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:29:39):**  So we put it in a lot of sun, but not full sun, like four or five hours enough to and  
**[0:29:45-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:29:45):**  then it boomed and it did really well.

**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:29:52):**  For two years, you could just tell it was not happy.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:29:55):**  Not all day, sun.

**[0:30:03-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:30:03):**  People don't understand grass secretes a chemical, which is toxic to trees.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:30:09):**  It basically that's how meadows stay meadows.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:30:12):**  They poison the seedlings around them and they outcompete it by their roots strangling  
**[0:30:18-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:30:18):**  it.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:30:19):**  So you let thick grass grow up to the trunks of your trees.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:30:22):**  And often the roots on grass will grow down six, 10, 12 inches, literally.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:30:28):**  So there's an inch of rain around your tree.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:30:32):**  And that tree is surrounded by grass.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:30:34):**  The grass is getting all the moisture, not your tree.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:30:37):**  So weeding and keeping the trunks cleared, at least for a few years till they get big  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:30:43):**  is a big shot in the arm to helping trees.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:30:47):**  Then when you put mulch down or you put compost down, the tree's getting it, not the grass.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:30:53):**  And when it rains, the tree's getting all the rain.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:30:56):**  And then I think once trees are two or three years old, they're not so finicky.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:31:00):**  But when they're young, they struggle.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:31:03):**  And that depends on the tree, of course.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:31:06):**  Some trees are like iron.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:31:07):**  They just don't care what you do.

**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:31:18):**  They've only got one tiny leaf thing that's never been a problem.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:31:22):**  Just in year after year, they grow fine.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:31:24):**  And they grow when it's a little too dry and they look a little wilted, but they do fine  
**[0:31:28-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:31:28):**  and the crops still come in.

**[0:31:34-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:31:34):**  soil.

**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:31:39):**  And I found that information about the plants in this book to be really, really helpful,  
**[0:31:44-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:31:44):**  especially for people who are trying out new plants for the first time.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:31:48):**  Knowing how much maintenance they're going to put into them is essential.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:31:52):**  And I've worked with planting operations and designs for clients and helping them put in  
**[0:31:57-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:31:57):**  perennial systems.

**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:32:04):**  plants to think about is how available are you going to be to actually look after these  
**[0:32:09-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:32:09):**  and maintain them because it's not just a matter of putting them in the ground.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:32:12):**  So that information is really useful.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:32:15):**  And I'm wondering then, how did you come up with some of the other criteria for the plants  
**[0:32:19-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:32:19):**  that you included here?

**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:32:29):**  What was the main impetus for these 50 that you selected?  
**[0:32:33-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:32:33):**  Well we actually were going to do 75.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:32:36):**  We were going to divide the book between subtropical plants that are kept as houseplants, vegetables  
**[0:32:43-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:32:43):**  that are perennial and the fruit.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:32:45):**  And an editor said, why don't you break it into two books?  
**[0:32:50-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:32:50):**  It will be easier for you because it's your first book.  
**[0:32:53-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:32:53):**  The first book will be fruit and the second book will be perennial herbs and vegetables.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:33:01):**  And then a thing that I'm obsessed with is houseplants that actually from subtropical  
**[0:33:06-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:33:06):**  regions that actually produce fruit because there's not really ever been a book written

**[0:33:16-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:33:16):**  So for people who keep rubber plants or pothos and just maybe swapping out for a food plant,  
**[0:33:24-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:33:24):**  I would say one of the main criteria is the yum factor, right?  
**[0:33:31-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:33:31):**  Like the eating factor.

**[0:33:40-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:33:40):**  of food that they're putting in, it's always like, well, you want to put in things that  
**[0:33:45-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:33:45):**  you're actually going to eat.

**[0:33:53-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:33:53):**  put it in.

**[0:34:04-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:34:04):**  put in five or six things.

**[0:34:12-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:34:12):**  can experience with working with all level of gardeners, experienced gardeners, people

**[0:38:34-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:38:34):**  Jujubes will do well and dry.

**[0:39:09-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:39:09):**  Zhou is the Chinese word for jujube.

**[0:39:21-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:39:21):**  And I would also then add to that, that one of the things that it should come to no surprise,  
**[0:39:28-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:39:28):**  but was still surprising, was that the amount of cultivars and varieties over time has shrunk.

**[0:53:36-0:53:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:53:36):**  Our woods are filled with wild cherry trees and that they're very important.

**[0:53:48-0:53:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:53:48):**  And the difference between a plum and a peach and wild cherry tree is a few chromosomes.  
**[0:53:53-0:53:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:53:53):**  It's the same tree.  
**[0:53:55-0:54:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:53:55):**  So if you plant near wild cherry trees, pests are going to come knocking on your door just

**[0:54:03-0:54:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:54:03):**  I planted them in 12 hours sun, optimal sun.  
**[0:54:06-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:54:06):**  I put them on sloped sloped landscapes.

**[0:54:13-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:54:13):**  away except for one or two of them.

**[0:54:22-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:54:22):**  The one for in the plum realm is the beach plum, Meritimia.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:54:29):**  And it's native just like our native the wild cherry trees that Scott's mentioning.  
**[0:54:36-0:54:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:54:36):**  Whereas most of the other prunus that we brought in were either from Europe or we're talking

**[0:54:45-0:54:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:54:45):**  And the reason I think that that does well, wild beach plums do well.  
**[0:54:50-0:54:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:54:50):**  And the other ones, the other ones are like coddled school kids from a private university.

**[0:54:59-0:55:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:54:59):**  You can almost drive a car over it and not kill it.

**[0:55:28-0:55:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/allyson-levy-and-scott-serrano-on-the-wealth-of-options-for-cold-hardy-fruit-and-nut-trees/#t=0:55:28):**  it's exposed to wind.

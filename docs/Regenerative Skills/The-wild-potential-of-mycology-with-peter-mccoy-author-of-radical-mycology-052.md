**[0:00:00-0:00:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:03-0:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:00:03):**  Here we dive deep into the worlds of permaculture, natural building, and regenerative living  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:00:07):**  as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself, for your community,  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:00:12):**  and for this beautiful planet that we all share.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:00:14):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I have a great session for you in this week's  
**[0:00:18-0:00:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:00:18):**  episode, so let's jump right in.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:00:20):**  Are you looking for the best resources to help you build a regenerative lifestyle?  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:00:34):**  New Society Publishers has been a leader in sustainable publishing for over 30 years.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:00:39):**  They publish good news and solutions for individuals and organizations seeking to change their  
**[0:00:43-0:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:00:43):**  lives so that they may change the world for the better.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:00:46):**  Their company mandate goes far beyond the single bottom line of profit.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:00:50):**  They care deeply not only about what they publish, but also how they do business.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:00:55):**  They believe in the authors that they take on and the works that they bring to the marketplace.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:00:59):**  From sustainable living to progressive parenting, New Society Publishers has the books you need  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:01:04):**  to help build a better world.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:01:06):**  Buy your print and ebooks online at www.NewSociety.com or at fine bookstores near you.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:01:13):**  Okay, today we're going to take a deep dive into the wide world of mycology and fungi  
**[0:01:18-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:01:18):**  with Peter McCoy, the author of Radical Mycology and founder of Mycologos, a new online educational  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:01:25):**  platform for courses on mushroom and fungal cultivation and knowledge.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:01:29):**  Now Peter has been studying mycology for more than 16 years and is one of the foremost educators  
**[0:01:34-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:01:34):**  and promoters on the potential of fungi.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:01:37):**  In this interview, we explore some of the many practical and exciting applications of  
**[0:01:41-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:01:41):**  mycelium such as building healthy soil, reviving contaminated sites and polluted ecosystems,  
**[0:01:47-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:01:47):**  medicine and nutrition, transforming waste products and even biological batteries.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:01:53):**  Now Peter is a wealth of information and does a remarkable job of making the deep and intricate  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:01:58):**  world of mycelium approachable and easy to understand for the layperson, a category that  
**[0:02:03-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:02:03):**  I certainly fall into.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:02:05):**  So I hope this episode inspires you and opens your mind to the incredible potential of fungi  
**[0:02:10-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:02:10):**  like it did for me.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:02:11):**  So I'll hand things over now to Peter McCoy.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:02:14):**  Hey Peter, thank you so much for taking the time to be here with us today.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:02:18):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:02:20-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:02:20):**  I'm doing great in the new year.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:02:22):**  Yeah, happy to be here.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:02:23):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:02:24):**  Where are you right now?  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:02:25):**  I am in my hometown of Portland, Oregon.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:02:29):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:02:30):**  I used to live there myself, but it's been quite a few years since I visited.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:02:32):**  How is the winter going so far?  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:02:36):**  You know, it's actually been a pretty mild winter.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:02:39):**  The weather's been a little bit of cold here and there, some rain, but not as much as normal.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:02:46):**  And today is actually fairly kind of mild.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:02:48):**  So it's been nice.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:02:49):**  Well, hey, I've got a ton of things that I'd love to ask you.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:02:53):**  And the world of mycology is a broad one.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:02:56):**  So what do you say we jump right into the questions?  
**[0:02:58-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:02:58):**  Yeah, sounds great.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:02:59):**  All right.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:03:00):**  So let's get started with having you tell us a little bit about your background.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:03:04):**  How did you become fascinated with the world of mycology and fungi?  
**[0:03:08-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:03:08):**  So, I've been, I got hooked on mycology, as with most people, as soon as I learned about  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:03:16):**  it.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:03:17):**  But unfortunately, that didn't come till a little bit later in my life than I might have  
**[0:03:21-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:03:21):**  hoped.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:03:22):**  Rather than learning about them in elementary school or something, I only got turned on  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:03:26):**  because my brother told me that you can grow mushrooms when I was a teenager.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:03:30):**  And just the notion that you could do that was really alluring to me, because I knew  
**[0:03:35-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:03:35):**  nothing about them, as most people I've ever met.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:03:38):**  I didn't learn anything about them.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:03:39):**  My family didn't know anything.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:03:42):**  But just the notion that you could grow these things seemed so strange.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:03:46):**  And that just appealed to my personality.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:03:48):**  I'm interested in odd things like that or something.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:03:51):**  So I just went to the library and got books to learn about it.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:03:54):**  And then as soon as I started reading about what the process is like, I got fascinated  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:03:58):**  by fungi themselves, because they are so interesting.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:04:02):**  And so then I started trying to grow and pretty much was hooked right then at about 15, 16.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:04:07):**  I forget exactly when.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:04:10):**  And it's pretty much stuck with me ever since.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:04:12):**  And over all the years, I've just read so much and I've studied so much now and done  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:04:17):**  quite a bit and met quite a number of people doing all kinds of things in mycology.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:04:21):**  And really, everything I learn, everything I do, everything I see other people doing  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:04:25):**  in the world of this fascinating topic just keeps me more and more inspired.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:04:30):**  It's sort of an endless life pursuit and one that really has so much unknown to it, which  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:04:37):**  is another reason it keeps me interested, because there's so much more to uncover.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:04:41):**  And really, anybody can do that.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:04:43):**  So that's something I picked up when I was a kid.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:04:46):**  Didn't quite have all that realization, but just the fascination was there pretty quickly.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:04:51):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:04:52):**  Yeah, I'm really starting to find that myself.  
**[0:04:54-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:04:54):**  I'm very much a newcomer to this world of study, but I've seen videos, read books that  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:05:01):**  really start to touch on the breadth of how broad this field of study can actually be  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:05:06):**  applied, not just in an academic sense, but really practical applications.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:05:12):**  And we'll get into those in just a minute.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:05:14):**  Now I know you've been studying the world of fungi for well over a decade now.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:05:18):**  What have been some of the biggest breakthroughs and discoveries that have been made since  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:05:22):**  you got into the world of mycology yourself?  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:05:28):**  I think, well, there's quite a lot, because really in the last, say, two decades, I've  
**[0:05:34-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:05:34):**  been studying for about 16 years, so about as long.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:05:37):**  But really, it's with the technology and a lot of stuff with genetics and DNA research,  
**[0:05:42-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:05:42):**  we've been able to uncover a good bit more.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:05:45):**  And then really, as the field has become more popular, and STEAM has really picked up around  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:05:50):**  that in the last decade especially, there's so much that's come.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:05:53):**  And so it's really an explosive time for the science, and so much that we're uncovering  
**[0:05:59-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:05:59):**  kind of out steps the last thing we found.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:06:03):**  I think some of the things that are most, and it's really hard for me to pick, there's  
**[0:06:08-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:06:08):**  sort of two major branches of how I look at mycology or sort of importance and implications.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:06:15):**  One major field is just the environmental and ecological effects and influences of fungi,  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:06:22):**  and how we are increasingly realizing them to be critical and central to so much of life.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:06:27):**  Whereas even 50, 40 years ago, they were recognized for decomposition or something, and that was  
**[0:06:33-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:06:33):**  about it.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:06:34):**  Whereas now we see that they are so integral to plant health and increasingly in animal  
**[0:06:39-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:06:39):**  health in many ways.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:06:41):**  And I really see them as central to so much of life, which is quite a big paradigm shift,  
**[0:06:47-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:06:47):**  and the one that's being increasingly supported through a lot of the research.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:06:50):**  It's sort of a broad realization, but one that's I think quite profound, and it's sort  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:06:54):**  of supported by so many small steps that have come along the way.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:06:58):**  And then the other major branch is just, as you said, the practical applications of not  
**[0:07:03-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:07:03):**  only cultivating mushrooms for food and medicine, which has been done for centuries really,  
**[0:07:10-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:07:10):**  but now we're realizing that fungal tissue, fungal mycelium as we call it, as a unique  
**[0:07:18-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:07:18):**  sort of substance, if you will, tissue, organism form on earth, that we can actually work with  
**[0:07:25-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:07:25):**  that to say create building materials.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:07:28):**  And really that's this quite large topic that is very exciting.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:07:33):**  We're really just scratching the surface of, and there's an increasingly perceived notion  
**[0:07:38-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:07:38):**  that just as plastic revolutionized our reality 100 years ago when it was invented, that perhaps  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:07:45):**  growing things with fungal tissue or mycelium will have a similar effect on society, on  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:07:51):**  civilization in that in 100 years, just as so much of our world today is made out of  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:07:55):**  plastic, perhaps in another 100, so much of our day-to-day existence will be fungal based  
**[0:08:00-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:08:00):**  or mycelium based from our building materials to the furniture we use, insulation in our  
**[0:08:08-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:08:08):**  homes, perhaps even the paneling that builds our homes, and perhaps even our clothing or  
**[0:08:12-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:08:12):**  certain parts of our apparel will be made out of fungal tissue.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:08:18):**  It's really incredible in that sense.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:08:21):**  And then there's the other applications, one that got me perhaps the most excited or reinvigorated  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:08:26):**  when I was about 20, after having just been interested in fungi sort of more topically  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:08:31):**  or for just cultivation and sort of the intrigue, when I learned about the ability of fungi  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:08:36):**  to clean up pollution, that really re-sparked my interest because at the time I was becoming  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:08:41):**  increasingly invested in and really engaged in environmental issues and learning all about  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:08:46):**  that and sort of taking full authorship or ownership of my place in those kinds of issues  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:08:52):**  in the world and realizing, wow, fungi can actually help address and perhaps even alleviate  
**[0:08:57-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:08:57):**  some of the pollution issues in the world.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:08:59):**  And that was one of the things that really compelled me to become more engaged in the  
**[0:09:05-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:09:05):**  field and actually eventually soon thereafter, really a year or two later, I started teaching  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:09:09):**  these things what I knew as I started to realize that other people wanted to learn it as well.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:09:13):**  And that topic, micro remediation as we call it, is huge.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:09:18):**  There's a lot of potential there, but again, it's so new and really we have a lot of good  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:09:23):**  evidence in the lab that fungi can say, break down all kinds of toxic chemicals and even  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:09:28):**  plastics and things, but we've yet to come to the stage yet to apply this in the real  
**[0:09:34-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:09:34):**  world to on broad scales.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:09:37):**  And my hope and the hope of many people is that that time will come in the not too distant  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:09:41):**  future and we can really work with fungi and bacteria and plants to dramatically increase  
**[0:09:47-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:09:47):**  the health of our environment and have a lot of personal benefits beyond that as humans  
**[0:09:53-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:09:53):**  in a myriad of ways.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:09:54):**  Yeah, I absolutely agree.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:09:55):**  The more that I'm learning about this, I'm starting to see these broad applications.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:09:59):**  And for that reason, let's kind of take a focus on that second branch that you mentioned.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:10:03):**  I would love to talk about some of the most practical and exciting applications of mycological  
**[0:10:08-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:10:08):**  discovery kind of one by one.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:10:10):**  So let's start with how mycelium can help to build soil and work with plants for the  
**[0:10:15-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:10:15):**  better health of a whole ecosystem.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:10:17):**  Well, yeah, so there you're sort of bridging the two, those two major branches because  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:10:23):**  it gets into a real understanding and appreciation of their ecological roles and incorporating  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:10:29):**  that into a holistic land and soil management regimen.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:10:34):**  Whereas I think really historically and even still contemporarily, a lot of books and a  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:10:39):**  lot of programs don't have a good enough emphasis, in my opinion, on the importance of fungi,  
**[0:10:45-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:10:45):**  especially in soil.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:10:46):**  And I think that that largely comes from lack of access to information, lack of awareness,  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:10:51):**  lack of community dialogue.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:10:55):**  Nobody's been really saying that fungi are super important and so it's sort of been missed  
**[0:10:58-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:10:58):**  as a point.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:10:59):**  So just greater advocacy around that will increase the awareness because they are, as  
**[0:11:04-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:11:04):**  I said a moment ago, so important to so much of life, but especially in soils.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:11:12):**  Soil is a black box and there's a lot we don't understand about, a lot we can't study, a  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:11:15):**  lot of the microbes we cannot culture, both fungal and bacterial and otherwise, in the  
**[0:11:19-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:11:19):**  lab.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:11:20):**  So there's quite a lot we'll perhaps never be able to fully understand, of course.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:11:24):**  But what we do know about soil fungi is that certain classes of them are incredibly important.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:11:30):**  And perhaps the best studied and arguably some of the most important are a large group  
**[0:11:35-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:11:35):**  known as the mycorrhizal fungi.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:11:37):**  And these fungi form intimate associations with plant roots where fungus will wrap around  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:11:43):**  and penetrate into the root tips in a sort of form like a barter system, if you will,  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:11:48):**  between the plant and the fungus, where the plant provides photosynthesized sugars primarily  
**[0:11:53-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:11:53):**  to the fungus.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:11:54):**  In exchange, the fungus grows out quicker, more rapidly, with greater surface area because  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:11:59):**  its threads of tissue, again known as mycelium, are very thin, so it has a high surface area.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:12:05):**  And it can acquire through all that surface area nutrients and water and minerals and  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:12:11):**  provide that to the plant.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:12:14):**  These fungi, they're broken into several subtypes, but they sort of all perform this as one of  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:12:19):**  their primary roles.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:12:22):**  Different types will actually bridge between different families and hold different types  
**[0:12:26-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:12:26):**  of plants in an intact ecosystem and literally transmit nutrients between different types  
**[0:12:32-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:12:32):**  of species and different types of plants and really manage the ecosystem in many ways,  
**[0:12:38-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:12:38):**  if you will.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:12:39):**  And then on top of that, I think one of the most important things to recognize in this  
**[0:12:43-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:12:43):**  regard is that fungi in soils and elsewhere perform great feats, if you will, in the realm  
**[0:12:51-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:12:51):**  of chemical transformation.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:12:53):**  My friend likes to say, and I always quote him, that fungi are nature's greatest chemists.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:12:58):**  And that really they do so much in the realm of chemistry that plants, bacteria, and animals  
**[0:13:02-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:13:02):**  just really can't compare with.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:13:05):**  And this is especially true in soils and with these mycorrhizal fungi, where they can go  
**[0:13:08-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:13:08):**  out and through the release of digestive enzymes and certain acids, they can release and transform  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:13:16):**  minerals and nutrients in the soil and provide that in a soluble way, in a soluble form to  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:13:21):**  the plant in a way that the plant never could because the plant never evolved the need to  
**[0:13:25-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:13:25):**  do that.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:13:26):**  By and large, most plants rely on bacteria and fungi to provide them with their appropriate  
**[0:13:32-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:13:32):**  nutrients.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:13:33):**  And so in soil systems, in farms and even gardens and things, generally we have lost  
**[0:13:40-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:13:40):**  quite a lot of fungal diversity through tillage, through chemical inputs, through compaction.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:13:48):**  And there's various ways to try to bring these fungi back.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:13:52):**  And some of the most practical and easiest ways is just to buy an inoculum, meaning buy  
**[0:13:56-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:13:56):**  the spores.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:13:57):**  And this is increasingly common these days as awareness has grown around mycorrhizal  
**[0:14:01-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:14:01):**  fungi.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:14:03):**  So there's various products on the market.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:14:05):**  Now I can't necessarily recommend one or the other.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:14:08):**  What I can unfortunately say is that many independent studies have been done with some  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:14:12):**  products or quite a number of these products, most of them, and some of the more questionable  
**[0:14:16-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:14:16):**  ones tend to have much lower spore counts than they advertise.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:14:20):**  And I've heard from numerous people, whether it is professionally they test these products  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:14:24):**  or they are students in a classroom doing it as a school project, they've shown that  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:14:29):**  various products might have actually zero spores.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:14:33):**  So you really need to be cautious as a gardener, as a farmer, permaculturist, what have you,  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:14:38):**  to make sure you're buying from a reputable company.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:14:40):**  So I'll leave it up to the listener to do their own research and follow the instructions  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:14:46):**  and just try to bring these fungi in.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:14:48):**  From there, you're trying to minimize, as I say, tillage and chemical inputs.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:14:54):**  And part of that is fertilizer inputs.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:14:56):**  Now this might seem counterintuitive, but one of the major categories of these fungi  
**[0:15:01-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:15:01):**  are known as the arbuscular mycorrhizae.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:15:04):**  And they tend to not want to form, or rather the plant will not want to form the association  
**[0:15:09-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:15:09):**  if it's being over fertilized because it doesn't need the fungus.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:15:12):**  So part of their incorporation is actually lowering your phosphorus and nitrogen inputs  
**[0:15:17-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:15:17):**  a bit so that their relationship establishes and the fungus can actually do the work and  
**[0:15:23-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:15:23):**  provide the benefits, which will come through its scavenging for nutrients and boosting  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:15:27):**  the plant's health.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:15:30):**  So that's really just a short answer to a very, very large question.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:15:36):**  I recently did a seven-day workshop on soil fungi with another teacher and seven days  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:15:41):**  wasn't enough to cover all that we can say about soil fungi and their importance.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:15:46):**  But the mycorrhizae fungi are really one of the greatest places to start because there's  
**[0:15:50-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:15:50):**  the most research really around them.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:15:52):**  They're some of the easiest to work with and incorporate into food production.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:15:57):**  But then what comes along with that is also the good soil management and understanding  
**[0:16:02-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:16:02):**  what they need to survive.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:16:03):**  Wow, that's amazing.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:16:06):**  Just the implications of having so much more, not only that you can fit into a class of  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:16:12):**  that size, but I can only imagine how much more there is to learn.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:16:16):**  Like you said, soil science being kind of a black box and we're only starting to scratch  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:16:20):**  the surface and there may be plenty of things we might never understand, gives a little  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:16:26):**  bit of a window into the complexity of the life forms and the relationships in what we  
**[0:16:31-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:16:31):**  often kind of look over as being dirt and not understanding or appreciating for the  
**[0:16:38-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:16:38):**  complexity of how the nutrient delivery systems and the microbiome within the soil really  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:16:46):**  is essential to all the other functions that we do in permaculture or all has ripples all  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:16:52):**  throughout the rest of society, I would imagine.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:16:56):**  Yeah, they say that the biology in soil, I forget the exact numbers, but might be something  
**[0:17:02-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:17:02):**  I forget exactly equivalent to the biomass above ground or a significant portion of that.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:17:09):**  And that really the soil ecosystem really, because of the way it functions in such harmony,  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:17:14):**  can almost be seen as an organism unto itself, sort of in the way that our body is a whole  
**[0:17:19-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:17:19):**  community of other microbes all functioning in coordination.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:17:23):**  The soil is so complex, there's so many dynamics, which is why it's so hard to study, but yet  
**[0:17:29-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:17:29):**  it's obviously it works, it works very well.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:17:32):**  And it breathes and it transforms nutrients and it transmutes them and it purges toxins  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:17:38):**  like our lymph system and it moves nutrients around like our circulatory system.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:17:42):**  And a lot of these functional roles are performed primarily by fungi.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:17:46):**  They really are sort of the backbone, the connective tissue, the arterial system, the  
**[0:17:53-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:17:53):**  nervous system in some respects and how they coordinate the environment.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:18:00):**  They perform some of these structural, organizational and successful roles that enable not just  
**[0:18:06-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:18:06):**  soil to exist and persist, but really life on earth, especially terrestrial earth.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:18:13):**  And we're only beginning to realize that.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:18:16):**  And then when you really take a step back, for me, one of the greatest points of even  
**[0:18:20-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:18:20):**  thinking about this and studying it was actually sort of meditating on it for a moment and  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:18:24):**  letting it sink in.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:18:25):**  And this was years ago and really trying to think about when I go into environment, what  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:18:29):**  are all the roles that a fungus is doing when I step and when I look at a tree, that tree  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:18:33):**  is filled with fungi throughout its entirety, doing all kinds of things we don't even understand.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:18:39):**  It's really a fungal world that we live in, but it's masked by these things we call animals  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:18:43):**  and plants that have taken our attention for so long.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:18:47):**  Yeah, that is so cool.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:18:48):**  So hey, let's jump up one step or maybe two steps here in the food chain and talk about  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:18:54):**  another area in which fungi really exceed.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:18:57):**  And that's medicine making and nutrition for humans.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:19:00):**  I know you mentioned that we've been cultivating mushrooms and using them for nutritional benefits  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:19:06):**  and as medicine for a long time, but we seem to be getting into a place where we understand  
**[0:19:12-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:19:12):**  exactly how they work a lot better.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:19:14):**  Could you talk a little bit on that subject?  
**[0:19:16-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:19:16):**  Well, as far as nutrition goes, fungi, mushrooms specifically, generally can be seen as sort  
**[0:19:25-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:19:25):**  of a superfood or functional food is the more technical term, where they are highly nutritious  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:19:30):**  and at the same time have compounds that have medicinal benefit.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:19:35):**  So the nutritional end, they're generally quite high in protein.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:19:38):**  Some species can be relatively basically on par with meat by dry wheat in their protein  
**[0:19:43-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:19:43):**  content.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:19:44):**  A lot of mushrooms are complete protein, so they have all the essential amino acids.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:19:49):**  They tend to be quite high in trace minerals depending on what they were grown on.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:19:54):**  And they all produce varying degrees of vitamin D. Fungi in their tissue have a compound that's  
**[0:19:59-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:19:59):**  similar to our cholesterol, but it actually performs similar to the melanin in our skin  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:20:05):**  in that when UV light hits it, it converts into vitamin D, if you will.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:20:11):**  It's a precursor.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:20:12):**  So they can be quite high in this important compound that a lot of us lack from being  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:20:17):**  indoors and wearing a lot of clothing.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:20:21):**  So they're really nutritious really all around.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:20:24):**  They're low in fat, which isn't necessarily a good thing depending on how you look at  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:20:27):**  it, but that's really the only maybe drawback is they're low in fat because we need fat.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:20:33):**  On the medicinal end, the importance of medicinal mushrooms has been known for millennia.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:20:39):**  The oldest evidence of humans consuming mushrooms intentionally comes from almost 19,000 years  
**[0:20:45-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:20:45):**  ago.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:20:46):**  It's debatable whether they were consumed for food or for medicine or otherwise, but  
**[0:20:51-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:20:51):**  I would think that even if they were only consumed for food within a thousand years  
**[0:20:57-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:20:57):**  or less thereafter, somebody would have realized that they also get a sort of health benefit  
**[0:21:02-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:21:02):**  from eating mushrooms.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:21:03):**  That's just my conjecture.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:21:06):**  So our knowledge of medicinal mushrooms goes back probably quite far, much farther than  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:21:10):**  we currently recognize, which is usually based on ancient Chinese documents.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:21:15):**  Even in those documents from roughly 4,500 years ago, fungi are highly revered.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:21:22):**  Certain mushrooms are really at the top tier of traditional Chinese medicine.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:21:27):**  The pharmacopeia, they have thousands of ingredients today and still the number one, sort of the  
**[0:21:32-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:21:32):**  top of the list is the reishi mushroom.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:21:34):**  It's considered the king of all herbs, the supreme mushroom of immortality, 10,000 year  
**[0:21:40-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:21:40):**  mushroom, et cetera.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:21:41):**  So it's a really profound mushroom.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:21:43):**  And nowadays, the research and the science has been able to validate what thousands of  
**[0:21:48-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:21:48):**  years of anecdotal evidence has claimed.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:21:52):**  For one, these mushrooms, certain ones especially produce unique compounds that by and large  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:21:58):**  do have certain specific actions on the body.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:22:03):**  This varies by species and there's variables in there.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:22:05):**  But generally speaking, some of the most interesting compounds are high weight sugars in the cell  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:22:10):**  walls of the mushrooms that stimulate our immune system.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:22:14):**  Basically give it a workout is one way to think about it and turn it on without wearing  
**[0:22:19-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:22:19):**  it out.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:22:20):**  This has been found to potentially increase, say longevity after chemotherapy and radiation  
**[0:22:27-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:22:27):**  treatments which really suppress the immune system.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:22:30):**  These mushrooms and their extracts have been commonly prescribed in, say, Japan for decades  
**[0:22:36-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:22:36):**  as a really viable and important immune support for these more detrimental therapies that  
**[0:22:42-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:22:42):**  really compromise the immune system.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:22:43):**  That's a pretty good example.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:22:47):**  Then another really big and fascinating, quite a popular one these days is lion's mane mushroom  
**[0:22:52-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:22:52):**  which has unique compounds called hericenones and erinacines that stimulate our body's production  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:22:59):**  of what's called nerve growth factor.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:23:01):**  The outcome of that is essentially helping our nervous system regenerate to varying degrees.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:23:06):**  Potentially breaking up the plaques associated with Alzheimer's is one thought.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:23:11):**  Helping build the myelin insulation around our neurons.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:23:15):**  This has really profound implications for all kinds of mental health issues but also  
**[0:23:21-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:23:21):**  just generally for the healthy person having a more active but targeted thinking process,  
**[0:23:29-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:23:29):**  et cetera.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:23:30):**  It's a pretty popular supplement in regards to mushrooms that say these days is reishi  
**[0:23:35-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:23:35):**  and lion's mane.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:23:37):**  Another popular one is cordyceps because it's also been long known for its energy boosting  
**[0:23:44-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:23:44):**  properties.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:23:45):**  This is ancient Taoist medicine.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:23:48):**  Those are really some of the most popular ones I can talk about many others.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:23:52):**  They all vary and of course it's quite its own fascinating subject to explore.  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:23:57):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:23:58):**  Now, could you talk about one of the areas of mycology that I'm personally really excited  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:24:03):**  about and that's its capacity to rehabilitate damaged and toxic ecosystems.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:24:08):**  I know there have been some recent advancements in discovering what different fungi can do  
**[0:24:15-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:24:15):**  in these cases.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:24:16):**  Can you talk a little bit about those?  
**[0:24:18-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:24:18):**  Well, yeah.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:24:19):**  So this is what I was getting at earlier to some degree with the micro-immediation and  
**[0:24:24-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:24:24):**  that's one aspect of this larger ability, if you will, for fungi to help enhance or  
**[0:24:32-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:24:32):**  help increase the rate of regeneration in an environment.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:24:35):**  I like to always point out that when nature is hurt in the eyes of humans, whether it's  
**[0:24:41-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:24:41):**  by our own acts or by a natural disaster, given enough time it will come back.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:24:47):**  Life has a way and it might not be the same as it was before but it's not going to stay  
**[0:24:53-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:24:53):**  barren rock forever.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:24:54):**  It might take a long time.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:24:56):**  Often in those instances fungi are some of the pioneers in enabling life to come back  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:25:03):**  and if we do nothing it might take centuries or millennia but eventually something will  
**[0:25:06-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:25:06):**  establish a new ecology.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:25:08):**  What we can do with our skill set today, the latest advancements in cultivating and better  
**[0:25:15-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:25:15):**  understanding fungi is basically speed up that process.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:25:18):**  This can come in many different forms depending on what the impact has been to the environment.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:25:25):**  The one I gave before was say there's been a chemical spill.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:25:28):**  There is that strong possibility that we can incorporate certain fungi that have been shown  
**[0:25:32-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:25:32):**  in the lab to break down that same chemical and basically consume it as food and leave  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:25:39):**  behind non-toxic or hopefully less toxic byproducts in the process.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:25:45):**  There's other, the mycorrhizal fungi are another example where they're not necessarily breaking  
**[0:25:50-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:25:50):**  down a compound but they can.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:25:52):**  There's also been evidence of that but they might just be supporting plants that you're  
**[0:25:55-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:25:55):**  establishing in say disturbed habitat.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:25:57):**  You're trying to rebuild something similar to the previous ecology, those plants you're  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:26:03):**  bringing in need to establish the fungi will help that process.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:26:07):**  If there's debris, if there's organic debris you can chip that up and feed it to mushrooms  
**[0:26:11-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:26:11):**  and they can just break that down and build the soil quicker.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:26:15):**  We help speed up the decomposition that would otherwise take decades.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:26:20):**  Generally it's again kind of goes back to the a lot of the systems and protocols that  
**[0:26:28-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:26:28):**  have been developed for bioremediation or just general habitat restoration are good  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:26:35):**  and they've worked quite well but generally speaking they often don't have a strong emphasis  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:26:40):**  or sometimes a complete lack of emphasis or even a recognition of the importance of fungi  
**[0:26:45-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:26:45):**  in a given design.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:26:48):**  What I always like to say is just we just need to add that fungal layer on top of everything  
**[0:26:51-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:26:51):**  else or mix it in or maybe make it as the foundation of everything else and support  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:26:55):**  the other steps to make it a much more holistic methodology.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:27:00):**  Because really when it comes down to it the methods of cultivation aren't so difficult.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:27:04):**  This is something for people that are new to it, it might sound like a large new topic,  
**[0:27:09-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:27:09):**  hard to wrap your head around and it certainly is to some respects but at the end of the  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:27:12):**  day actually cultivating fungi, understanding what they need to grow, it's about as simple  
**[0:27:17-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:27:17):**  as plants if you will.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:27:18):**  We put them in the soil, they need some nutrients and water, light and they'll more or less  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:27:22):**  grow and there's a lot of ways to do that better but you'll get some sort of result.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:27:27):**  Same with mushrooms if you will.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:27:29):**  In an outdoor setting where things have been disturbed there's only so much you can control  
**[0:27:34-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:27:34):**  and only so many things you want to control.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:27:37):**  What comes along with it to do it, to be most successful is just to have a good design and  
**[0:27:42-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:27:42):**  to effectively execute what you're trying to do in the get go so that everything rolls  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:27:48):**  out as smoothly as possible, nature takes its course and really all you need to understand  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:27:52):**  for the fungi is what they need to grow which again is primarily food, water, nice comfortable  
**[0:27:58-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:27:58):**  space and not too hot, not too cold.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:28:01):**  Yeah, it certainly seems like this is one of those practices like so many others where  
**[0:28:05-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:28:05):**  you can go down the rabbit hole as far as you want and get very, very technical and  
**[0:28:10-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:28:10):**  very complex but the basics are quite approachable to most people as well, correct?  
**[0:28:16-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:28:16):**  Exactly.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:28:17):**  Yeah, for the micro remediation especially this is a topic that like I said 10 years  
**[0:28:24-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:28:24):**  ago got me so excited and got me advocating that everybody should do this because everybody  
**[0:28:30-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:28:30):**  can to varying degrees.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:28:33):**  But then what I've come to realize over the years is that that's a little bit intimidating  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:28:36):**  for people because it kind of assumes you already know how to say cultivate mushrooms  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:28:40):**  which most people don't and you got to know how to do that to actually do the next step  
**[0:28:45-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:28:45):**  which is the remediation.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:28:47):**  So I can teach you how to grow mushrooms in just a few hours and really the extension  
**[0:28:52-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:28:52):**  of a given skill set to say how would you apply that same skill to a polluted pile of  
**[0:28:58-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:28:58):**  soil, an oily pile of soil.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:29:01):**  It's the same skill, the same steps and same concepts throughout.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:29:05):**  So what I nowadays encourage is doing it like I said good design so you save yourself time  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:29:10):**  but also to try to add to our knowledge because unfortunately not a lot of this has been done  
**[0:29:15-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:29:15):**  in the field and it's easy to do.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:29:18):**  It's just not enough people are doing it for whatever reason.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:29:23):**  It's intimidating or it's just kind of not common but it is certainly approachable and  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:29:29):**  then marrying that with say good testing so you actually know what your effect is and  
**[0:29:34-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:29:34):**  there's a lot of details there but the essence of it is you don't really need high degrees  
**[0:29:41-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:29:41):**  of technical expertise.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:29:42):**  You don't need a lab, really elaborate equipment to do these foundational skills of rehabilitating  
**[0:29:48-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:29:48):**  an environment and helping it regenerate with fungi.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:29:51):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:29:52):**  Now I'd like to go back to one of the things that you were talking about earlier and that's  
**[0:29:55-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:29:55):**  how fungi are nature's chemists.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:29:58):**  You said that fungi can fill a niche sort of by managing waste products and transforming  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:30:04):**  them into benign materials or even other useful products.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:30:07):**  Could you give us some examples of this?  
**[0:30:10-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:30:10):**  Well I mean it's what we do in all cultivation really.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:30:16):**  On the broad scale so much of our food system is missing major link in the chain I guess  
**[0:30:25-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:30:25):**  that would make it a closed chain, closed circle chain which is mushroom cultivation.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:30:30):**  So roughly depending on the crop 80 to 90% of a given crop is if it's not composted which  
**[0:30:38-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:30:38):**  hopefully it is, it might be burned or hauled off of the property which is kind of crazy  
**[0:30:42-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:30:42):**  to anybody that's interested in compost and soil.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:30:44):**  You know that that doesn't make any sense.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:30:45):**  I can't tell you how crazy that drives me.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:30:47):**  I live in a region where it's slash and burn at the end of every harvest season just breaks  
**[0:30:51-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:30:51):**  my heart.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:30:53):**  Yeah but all that material could probably depending on the crop but most crops this  
**[0:30:58-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:30:58):**  is true you can use that to grow mushrooms.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:31:00):**  So you can grow a whole new crop in the winter months when you're probably not growing many  
**[0:31:05-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:31:05):**  plants.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:31:06):**  So it's a great sort of pairing to the plant season.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:31:09):**  The winter colder season is great for growing mushrooms on all the waste of the plants you  
**[0:31:13-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:31:13):**  just grew in the summer in the fall.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:31:16):**  And so we could have so many more mushrooms.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:31:18):**  This would lower the cost and increase our health and a lot of jobs and all this kind  
**[0:31:22-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:31:22):**  of stuff could come from just spreading that skill.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:31:25):**  And that's really what you know for the small scale grower or whatever scale grower you're  
**[0:31:30-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:31:30):**  usually using some sort of waste product.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:31:32):**  And so this is sort of what fungi do in the environment.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:31:35):**  They take their decomposers they take the things that need to be broken down to create  
**[0:31:40-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:31:40):**  new soil for new life.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:31:42):**  And so that's the fall leaves the twigs what have you for the home grower you're using  
**[0:31:48-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:31:48):**  other types of low cost and hopefully free if you can get it agricultural or even urban  
**[0:31:54-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:31:54):**  waste streams.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:31:55):**  So common things include say coffee grounds and cardboard in a city environment or maybe  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:32:01):**  straw which is not quite a waste because there's other uses for that but it's not that expensive  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:32:06):**  to say sawdust which can be relatively inexpensive where I am it comes from the lumber mills  
**[0:32:11-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:32:11):**  it's a sort of waste product.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:32:13):**  And but to things like corn cobs and peanut shells and pistachio shells and cottonseed  
**[0:32:19-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:32:19):**  holes and other other agricultural waste coffee holes coffee husks rather things that really  
**[0:32:25-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:32:25):**  have no agricultural value.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:32:27):**  That's something we have a lot of here.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:32:29):**  After coffee season there's an endless amount of pulp we're starting to use it in our compost  
**[0:32:33-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:32:33):**  and also as chicken feed but it's fascinating to think that we could use that for mushrooms  
**[0:32:37-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:32:37):**  as well certainly in the seasons to come.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:32:40):**  Yeah so that's really to grow mushrooms there's some sort of standard recipes we use when  
**[0:32:46-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:32:46):**  you have you live in say you know a given city in North America where most ingredients  
**[0:32:50-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:32:50):**  can be accessible.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:32:51):**  But when you go if you want to cut costs or maybe live somewhere more remote you're just  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:32:56):**  going to look for whatever common waste streams are around you that you can get kind of consistently  
**[0:33:01-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:33:01):**  in from them you develop a recipe that your mushrooms are going to like and there's some  
**[0:33:04-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:33:04):**  you know trial and error there basically.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:33:07):**  But once you figure that out you grow mushrooms on almost anything really I mean it kind of  
**[0:33:10-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:33:10):**  it's a little bit of a hyperbole but it's also kind of true because really they've been  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:33:14):**  shown to grow certain mushrooms can grow over 200 different agricultural waste streams.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:33:19):**  Some mushrooms are very aggressive very ravenous and will eat almost anything you put in their  
**[0:33:24-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:33:24):**  path as long as the nutrients are balanced you know sort of the not quite in p.k. it's  
**[0:33:29-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:33:29):**  like the same as plants but similar to that.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:33:31):**  Wow.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:33:32):**  Now I know that we're just kind of touching on the tip of the iceberg when it comes to  
**[0:33:37-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:33:37):**  all the uses of fungi.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:33:39):**  What are some of the lesser known applications that you're exploring or starting to research  
**[0:33:43-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:33:43):**  yourself?  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:33:44):**  It's a big question.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:33:49):**  I think one of the well I think one of the more interesting things that's come out in  
**[0:33:54-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:33:54):**  a few years is one more obscure sort of application of cultivation is the study was maybe three  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:34:02):**  or four years ago at this point where they took the tissue from the cap of a portobello  
**[0:34:07-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:34:07):**  and they pyrolyzed it like when you make biochar and they were able to use that burnt tissue  
**[0:34:15-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:34:15):**  or that paralyzed tissue as the anode in a in a battery.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:34:19):**  It was basically able to store charge better than the normal anodes that you use in a lithium  
**[0:34:25-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:34:25):**  ion battery and they were actually seeing that it could hold more charge over time rather  
**[0:34:30-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:34:30):**  than less charge which is how you know that's why your battery is going to run out is they  
**[0:34:33-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:34:33):**  can't hold charge anymore.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:34:36):**  And so that is crazy.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:34:39):**  And so it has this amazing.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:34:40):**  I had not heard that one before.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:34:43):**  If my technology is on the forefront of battery technology this would definitely take it into  
**[0:34:48-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:34:48):**  a whole new stratosphere of exploration.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:34:53):**  Yeah yeah.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:34:54):**  So there's and there's actually a sort of similar but different in the cultivation realm.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:34:59):**  There's been some good studies come out the last handful of years especially from Asia  
**[0:35:04-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:35:04):**  showing that when we electrocute or sort of shock mushrooms with basically a simulated  
**[0:35:09-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:35:09):**  lightning strike we can double or triple their normal yields.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:35:13):**  And so that's an interesting not really application of mushroom cultivation but way to enhance  
**[0:35:17-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:35:17):**  our cultivation is through electric electrical shocking which seems you know counterintuitive  
**[0:35:23-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:35:23):**  maybe but it's been shown to work time and time again which is really so intriguing in  
**[0:35:26-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:35:26):**  a way.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:35:28):**  Yeah and so when I take that actually a step further one of the things that I'm most interested  
**[0:35:34-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:35:34):**  perhaps in similar realms is that and I talk about this in my book to a good degree to  
**[0:35:40-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:35:40):**  sort of explain my my line of thought but there's a lot of ways that fungi grow that  
**[0:35:45-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:35:45):**  we cannot explain.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:35:46):**  There's actually quite a lot of mystery around just even basic fundamental growth processes  
**[0:35:52-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:35:52):**  and I try to actually resolve these issues by bringing in the question or the notion  
**[0:35:58-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:35:58):**  that perhaps fungi are communicating in their growth via electrical signals which is not  
**[0:36:03-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:36:03):**  really something we typically think about biology usually we're looking at chemical  
**[0:36:06-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:36:06):**  signals but really the last less than a decade it's been shown and recognized and accepted  
**[0:36:13-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:36:13):**  that between bacterial cells and our own our own cells there are along with chemical signals  
**[0:36:18-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:36:18):**  electrical forms of signals that are used as communication.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:36:22):**  And so what I talk about in my book is that if that is the case and this would help resolve  
**[0:36:27-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:36:27):**  a lot of this sort of unexplainable growth process perhaps someday we can learn to sort  
**[0:36:33-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:36:33):**  of decipher that code and maybe not exactly communicate with the mushrooms but maybe like  
**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:36:39):**  in the movie Avatar tap into their webs in the environment get a reading on what they're  
**[0:36:44-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:36:44):**  what they're communicating about the environment to some degree.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:36:48):**  It sounds pretty science fiction but I think that the it's definitely plausible that the  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:36:54):**  degree through which to which we'll be able to decipher it is yet to be seen.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:36:59):**  Certainly yeah like the implications of that are incredible it would mean that that's essentially  
**[0:37:03-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:37:03):**  the neurological network of the earth or at least the crust of the earth.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:37:07):**  Exactly well it's not just the crust because you know there's there's examples of certain  
**[0:37:14-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:37:14):**  fungi communicating in between each other in ways that shouldn't occur and based on  
**[0:37:21-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:37:21):**  other types of biology other organisms on earth and especially with this sort of external  
**[0:37:27-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:37:27):**  signaling that we're not even really looking for.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:37:29):**  Now if it is existing in the soil could it be that the fungi throughout all the plants  
**[0:37:36-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:37:36):**  and all plant tissues are permeated by what are known as endophytic fungi fungi that basically  
**[0:37:39-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:37:39):**  form the skeleton of a plant it's like a hidden system inside of all plants are they are they  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:37:46):**  communicating the same way now as a whole or all the fungi the environment sort of telephoning  
**[0:37:50-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:37:50):**  throughout each other in this way.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:37:53):**  It's something I think about sometimes I have no idea but there's certainly think that there's  
**[0:37:59-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:37:59):**  it's a question to to follow up on not just entirely dismiss.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:38:03):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:38:04):**  Wow that's definitely piqued my curiosity to learn a lot more and I hope so as well  
**[0:38:10-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:38:10):**  for a lot of our listeners.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:38:11):**  Now I know you're very passionate about the education of mycology and promoting awareness  
**[0:38:16-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:38:16):**  of the fungal world and that you're now underway with a very ambitious project of creating  
**[0:38:21-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:38:21):**  an online school to do just that.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:38:23):**  Can you tell us a bit about mycologos is it mycologos or mycologos.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:38:30):**  Yes mycologos.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:38:32):**  And all of the education programs that you're building through there.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:38:36):**  Yes so you know I've been studying this topic for like I said 16 years and it's primarily  
**[0:38:41-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:38:41):**  been a labor of love.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:38:43):**  I took a little bit of I took one class in college the one class that was offered mostly  
**[0:38:48-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:38:48):**  on identification and but really I through the school I went to there was very limited  
**[0:38:54-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:38:54):**  offerings and this is a common theme.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:38:56):**  Most people I meet who are especially really engaged with mycology want to take it further  
**[0:39:00-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:39:00):**  than just say foraging or even cultivation.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:39:04):**  There's really not much out there.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:39:06):**  There are a few certainly master's programs and even some others actually not really an  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:39:10):**  undergraduate dedicated undergraduate program yet.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:39:15):**  I think one student just recently from University of Wisconsin was the first undergrad to get  
**[0:39:20-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:39:20):**  a degree in mycology this was I saw us on Facebook recently.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:39:25):**  So it kind of speaks to the glut of access.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:39:28):**  Now that are better programs that there's more programs that are given university some  
**[0:39:32-0:39:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:39:32):**  have more dedicated departments.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:39:34):**  Most universities however don't even have a mycology department.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:39:37):**  So it's a really inaccessible science in the truest sense and it's not it's really not  
**[0:39:43-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:39:43):**  exaggeration.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:39:44):**  So mostly if the listeners never really thought about it you probably never learned anything  
**[0:39:49-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:39:49):**  about mycology and all of your education or if you learn anything in environmental science  
**[0:39:53-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:39:53):**  or in biology it might have just been for one day or one short paragraph in the textbook  
**[0:39:58-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:39:58):**  kind of thing.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:39:59):**  It's a very really overlooked field.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:40:01):**  So knowing this and knowing how important and fascinating everything it is I've tried  
**[0:40:07-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:40:07):**  over the years to provide different ways to share my knowledge through doing events, doing  
**[0:40:12-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:40:12):**  workshops, wrote quite a large book the other year and I still have felt and realized that  
**[0:40:18-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:40:18):**  it's just not quite enough that people need better you know we all need structure we need  
**[0:40:22-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:40:22):**  sort of guided mentorship and really in essence a school and a dedicated format.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:40:28):**  And so that's exactly what the mycologos is.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:40:32):**  So we just successfully crowdfunded it in December and now the throughout the year what's  
**[0:40:38-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:40:38):**  the plan is is to produce a series of over a dozen different video courses that will  
**[0:40:44-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:40:44):**  cover topics from fungal ecology to cultivation skills to varying depths to micromediation  
**[0:40:50-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:40:50):**  to varying depths medicine making the cultural history of fungi which we haven't really talked  
**[0:40:56-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:40:56):**  about and fungal ferments and quite a number of other things.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:41:00):**  So it's this and that's really just phase one those are kind of the most I think engaging  
**[0:41:05-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:41:05):**  and accessible topics for people to sink their teeth into and actually do something with  
**[0:41:10-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:41:10):**  and the hope down the future or the future is have more online offerings but also starting  
**[0:41:17-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:41:17):**  to do in-person courses which I've already been doing in various forms for a number of  
**[0:41:21-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:41:21):**  years but doing more of them in different forms both in Portland here and perhaps around  
**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:41:27):**  the world and so there's really nothing like this that exists.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:41:32):**  As I say some universities have departments and programs which are great but they're usually  
**[0:41:36-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:41:36):**  quite limited.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:41:38):**  This is going to be something quite different you know in some ways inspired by permaculture  
**[0:41:43-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:41:43):**  community and PDCs and things but sort of you know inspired by many other educational  
**[0:41:51-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:41:51):**  infrastructures that I've seen but sort of its own format just due to what the science  
**[0:41:56-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:41:56):**  needs you know really to be able to provide a full scope of what I know and also the co-teachers  
**[0:42:02-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:42:02):**  I plan to bring into the future.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:42:05):**  You know it really needs to be a multi-year program for people that want to go deep if  
**[0:42:09-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:42:09):**  they want you know in that respect or breaking off the segments for folks who just want certain  
**[0:42:15-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:42:15):**  components.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:42:16):**  Fascinating.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:42:17):**  Yeah I'm really looking forward to seeing when those educational courses come out.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:42:22):**  That's definitely the type of thing that I would love to dive deeper into as well.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:42:25):**  You certainly piqued my curiosity even more than before this.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:42:29):**  Now before I let you go could you tell us a little bit about how people can get in contact  
**[0:42:34-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:42:34):**  with you and your organization.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:42:36):**  If you've got any educational events coming up how they can find those as well and how  
**[0:42:41-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:42:41):**  they can follow your progress with this new project of Michael Logos.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:42:46):**  Sure well they can they can stay in touch in two ways.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:42:50):**  So Michael Logos dot world is the website for the new school.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:42:56):**  We're sort of just having finished the Kickstarter at the time of the recording here.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:43:01):**  We're kind of going to be redoing the website in the next couple of weeks and sort of touching  
**[0:43:04-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:43:04):**  it up putting some more information on there about how to sort of pre-register for the  
**[0:43:09-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:43:09):**  courses because it's they're going to take all year to produce.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:43:12):**  That was what the Kickstarter was for was for funding production.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:43:16):**  But you can join our email list and just sort of following there and social media as well.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:43:20):**  But you can also check out the other organization that I've been involved with for over a decade  
**[0:43:25-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:43:25):**  which is called Radical Mycology which is more fungal advocacy mycology advocacy.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:43:30):**  And we do various events through there and it's just more you know for building the culture  
**[0:43:35-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:43:35):**  and credit community around the topic.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:43:38):**  And the website for that is radical mycology dot com.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:43:41):**  There's an email list there as well and we're on social media both the handles are Michael  
**[0:43:46-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:43:46):**  Logos and Rad Mycology.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:43:49):**  R A D M Y C O L O G Y.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:43:53):**  And so you should be able to find us wherever on the major platforms.  
**[0:43:57-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:43:57):**  And yeah just keep up to date.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:43:58):**  There's nothing major planned as of yet.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:44:00):**  I will be doing an event doing a workshop down in L.A. as a part of the L.A. Mushroom  
**[0:44:06-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:44:06):**  Festival in February.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:44:07):**  I'll be in Australia at the end of January for some events but nothing nothing huge planned  
**[0:44:16-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:44:16):**  currently kind of laying low post post crowdfunding.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:44:19):**  I can imagine that must have been a big effort.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:44:21):**  Well congratulations on reaching and actually surpassing your goal.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:44:25):**  And I'm very keen to see how this develops in the future and continue to do more research  
**[0:44:31-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:44:31):**  on mycology.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:44:33):**  Thank you so much for taking the time today Peter is a real pleasure to have you here.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:44:36):**  I hope we can do a follow up because frankly I have a ton more questions after hearing  
**[0:44:41-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-mccoy-mycelium/#t=0:44:41):**  your answers already.

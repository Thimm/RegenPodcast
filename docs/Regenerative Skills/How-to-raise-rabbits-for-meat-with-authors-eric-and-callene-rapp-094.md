**[0:02:21-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:02:21):**  AbundantAge.com.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:02:22):**  We're looking forward to seeing you here.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:02:25):**  Animals and livestock can be an essential component to land restoration and adding fertility  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:02:30):**  to your farm or garden if managed correctly.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:02:33):**  And while we already have goats, chickens, and ducks on our small demonstration farm  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:02:36):**  here in Guatemala, I've been looking into the addition of another animal enterprise  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:02:41):**  that would fit into our existing systems without overwhelming the small space that we have.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:02:46):**  For a while, I've been interested in rabbits for their fast reproduction, amazingly fertile  
**[0:02:51-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:02:51):**  manure, and their delicious lean meat.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:02:54):**  That's when I came across a book called Raising Rabbits for Meat by Eric and Colleen Rapp  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:02:59):**  and published by my good friends and supporters at New Society Publishers.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:03:03):**  Now immediately I wanted to reach out to Eric and Colleen because of the abundance of well-explained  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:03:08):**  and practical knowledge from their experience raising heritage breeds of rabbits for both  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:03:12):**  genetic conservation and high quality protein.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:03:16):**  So in this interview, Eric and Colleen share their wealth of knowledge in running a profitable  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:03:20):**  rabbitry and walk us through the process of how they got started, general care and maintenance,  
**[0:03:26-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:03:26):**  breeding, harvesting, and much more.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:03:29):**  So be sure to stay tuned until the end when we talk about some of their delicious rabbit  
**[0:03:32-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:03:32):**  recipes that they also include in the book.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:03:35):**  Now before I give everything away, I'll hand things over to Eric and Colleen.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:03:40):**  Hey Colleen and Eric, thank you so much for taking the time to join me today.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:03:43):**  How are you both doing?  
**[0:03:44-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:03:44):**  We're both doing great.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:03:45):**  Thank you for having us.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:03:47):**  Hey, it's my pleasure.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:03:48):**  I've really enjoyed getting through your book Raising Rabbits for Meat and I've got a ton  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:03:53):**  of questions that I think will be really valuable to our listeners who haven't maybe considered  
**[0:03:58-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:03:58):**  this as a livestock option, especially in small spaces.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:04:01):**  So what do you say we just jump right on in?  
**[0:04:03-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:04:03):**  Sounds good.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:04:04):**  All right, so let's start at the beginning.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:04:07):**  What first got you two interested in raising rabbits?  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:04:10):**  Because I know only later did you actually start harvesting them for meat.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:04:14):**  Right.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:04:15):**  So what started it was on the news about the 8 million food recall of that particular year  
**[0:04:24-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:04:24):**  and we both were just like, we're tired of this.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:04:27):**  We need to take a little bit more control over what we're eating.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:04:31):**  And Eric, and I'll let him fill you in on his history with rabbits, but he had raised  
**[0:04:35-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:04:35):**  rabbits before.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:04:36):**  It was a completely new thing to me.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:04:39):**  So that was pretty much what kind of started it.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:04:42):**  We started with just a handful of rabbits.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:04:44):**  We were only going to just harvest a few for ourselves and it kind of exploded from there.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:04:52):**  And for you, Eric?  
**[0:04:54-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:04:54):**  She pretty much summed it up.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:04:57):**  I'd been around rabbits since I was pretty much big enough to carry a feed bucket, so  
**[0:05:02-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:05:02):**  it was something we knew plenty about.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:05:05):**  We wanted to do that needed some conservation work and that was really one of our main goals  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:05:11):**  if we were going to do this work with an animal that needed conservation work.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:05:16):**  And a lot of these breeds I'd raised with my granddad when I was a kid and some of them  
**[0:05:22-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:05:22):**  were almost to the point of extinction.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:05:23):**  So that was some of the main goals there.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:05:27):**  One thing led to another and interest kind of got back into the meat side of restaurants  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:05:34):**  wanting to put it back on their menus, but really didn't have the animal that worked  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:05:38):**  best for their profit margins.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:05:43):**  So in order to accomplish the breed conservation, you have a lot of animals that need to be  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:05:50):**  culled that shouldn't be breeding stock.  
**[0:05:53-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:05:53):**  So you have to find somebody other than friends and relatives to get them to eat your extra  
**[0:06:01-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:06:01):**  harvested animals.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:06:02):**  So that's what kind of led to this becoming the size it is today.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:06:08):**  And so why did you choose the heritage breeds that you are now trying to preserve?  
**[0:06:14-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:06:14):**  What was your criteria?  
**[0:06:17-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:06:17):**  Well we have been involved with the livestock conservancy for many years and the breeds  
**[0:06:25-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:06:25):**  that we chose were ones that eventually went on to be on their conservation priority list  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:06:32):**  that were so few in number they were literally on the verge of extinction.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:06:37):**  So a lot of what's our conservation work has kind of been an ongoing thing and rabbits  
**[0:06:42-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:06:42):**  just kind of were like the next phase of that.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:06:45):**  We also chose breeds that were unique to North America.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:06:51):**  The three main breeds that we have worked with were developed in the United States and  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:06:56):**  were tremendously popular in the 20s and 30s which was when rabbit was really in its heyday.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:07:01):**  And so that's kind of how we came to work with that particular set of breeds.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:07:08):**  And so let's switch to a little bit of a controversial topic within raising animals.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:07:13):**  Why did you decide to raise your rabbits in pens rather than let them roam around in pasture  
**[0:07:18-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:07:18):**  or forest?  
**[0:07:19-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:07:19):**  Because I know you have some very good economic reasons for this as well as being able to  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:07:23):**  sort of help to more closely monitor the health and nutrition.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:07:29):**  Right, basically it would have been difficult to do what we did with the rabbits on any  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:07:36):**  type of scale if we were pasture feeding.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:07:42):**  Pasture feeding or natural or whatever you want to call it has some pluses but it's got  
**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:07:48):**  some pretty serious downsides.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:07:51):**  Anytime you put a rabbit or any animal on the ground and where it is you know on the  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:07:58):**  same ground it's got to defecate on.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:08:00):**  You run the risk of parasite transmission anytime you expose them to birds that can  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:08:07):**  fly over and defecate into the pen there's a lot of parasites like coccidia that can  
**[0:08:12-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:08:12):**  get transmitted that way.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:08:14):**  And also I like my neighbors but I don't like feeding their dogs and predation is a real  
**[0:08:21-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:08:21):**  you know problem with anything outside.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:08:23):**  You've got to have some pretty good predator control because rabbits can't really defend  
**[0:08:28-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:08:28):**  themselves from a dog or a coyote or you know even a big bird of prey or anything like that.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:08:35):**  Domestic rabbits do very well in pens.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:08:38):**  They seem to enjoy the safety and the security for want of a better phrase and we've not  
**[0:08:47-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:08:47):**  noticed over you know the hundreds of thousands of rabbits any of them really having any drawbacks  
**[0:08:55-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:08:55):**  or suffering from from the type of system we chose or we wouldn't have done it.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:08:59):**  Sure.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:09:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:09:01):**  Like my very limited experience with rabbits was when I had a friend in Oregon who would  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:09:07):**  sometimes let their rabbits out into the garden to roam around and play and my goodness they  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:09:12):**  are hard to catch after that even in a fairly small space.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:09:15):**  I can only imagine what the maintenance and harvesting would be like if you had to go  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:09:19):**  out and physically catch them as well.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:09:23):**  Right and they are very much a burrowing animal.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:09:26):**  So any you know enclosure you put them in they're going to try to thwart your efforts  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:09:32):**  by digging out and tunneling and you know there's just there's just a lot of drawbacks  
**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:09:37):**  that we felt weren't worth it.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:09:39):**  Now you've tried different designs for cages.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:09:43):**  How did you decide on the ones that you use now and if you could give us a little of an  
**[0:09:47-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:09:47):**  idea on the advantages that this pen design has as well.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:09:54):**  Pen design a lot of times what people start out with is something made out of wood and  
**[0:10:01-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:10:01):**  I always refer to rabbits as similar to beaver's elk take the nicest wood structure you can  
**[0:10:09-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:10:09):**  build and probably demolish it within six months to a year and then there's only certain  
**[0:10:15-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:10:15):**  types of materials you can use.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:10:19):**  The pen space depends on the size of animals you're going to use smaller animals don't  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:10:24):**  require as much space.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:10:26):**  You can keep it a lot cleaner.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:10:29):**  You can keep fly strike is something that's pretty prominent and operations that don't  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:10:36):**  keep a good environment underneath the pens which means keeping the manure hauled out.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:10:42):**  So we tried to make our pens as big as we can but still be efficient and with the conservation  
**[0:10:51-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:10:51):**  work we have to be able to keep the breed integrities and know whose parents and that  
**[0:10:59-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:10:59):**  so it we ended up with about 400 pens to complete the projects we're doing with several different  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:11:09):**  breeds and it's much easier to keep them clean.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:11:14):**  You'll keep down a lot of your parasite issues with pens.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:11:19):**  The pens that are a lot of them that are available now at farm supply stores are really made  
**[0:11:24-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:11:24):**  for lop eared rabbits and small rabbits a lot of them aren't much over 16 inches high.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:11:32):**  We go 24 inches high and that gives them room to stand up and stretch and stuff in the pen.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:11:38):**  So they're just you can spend as much as you want on a pen.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:11:43):**  I've seen really good pens made out of recycled materials that just you have to keep in mind  
**[0:11:49-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:11:49):**  that they do poop and pee a lot so that material has to be handled.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:11:59):**  And so tell me a little bit about since you're not using wood what are the pens made out  
**[0:12:04-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:12:04):**  of what are the general dimensions and how does this sort of facilitate maintenance and  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:12:11):**  better health for the rabbits.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:12:14):**  The pens are all made out of wire we use half by inch for the floors and then the one by  
**[0:12:24-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:12:24):**  two for the sides and the top and the dimensions you're going to have to tell me the dimensions  
**[0:12:31-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:12:31):**  because the dimensions are going to be according to the size of rabbit you have.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:12:37):**  The meat breeds that we use we like to not go any further than about 36 inches wide and  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:12:45):**  all of them are 24 inches deep.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:12:48):**  Buck pens can be a little smaller I like to do a 30 inch wide on them when you take the  
**[0:12:55-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:12:55):**  dough to the buck you don't want a gigantic pen for them to run around and not get business  
**[0:13:02-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:13:02):**  taken care of.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:13:03):**  So there's all there's vinyl coated wire which is very expensive a lot of people think that's  
**[0:13:10-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:13:10):**  going to be much easier on the pads of the rabbit's feet but what you end up with there  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:13:18):**  you spend a lot of money and they will chew that completely up over a short period of  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:13:23):**  time and then urine and manure gets in there and then it starts rusting and then you you'll  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:13:28):**  have also an area for disease to get started.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:13:34):**  There's kind of a misconception of wire causing sore pads on a lot of rabbits that usually  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:13:44):**  starts with the structure of the rabbit is wrong to begin with if you watch them setting  
**[0:13:48-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:13:48):**  in their pens rabbits that end up with sore pads will get that out of just about any type  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:13:54):**  of flooring because they're setting on their back feet wrong and it's not flat so it's  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:14:00):**  actually a structural issue on a lot of those sore pads.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:14:04):**  So you can build a rabbit pen out of about anything out of any of the materials you just  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:14:09):**  have to keep the environment you know the outside environment whether you're going to  
**[0:14:15-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:14:15):**  have possibility of rain or snow blowing in or you know just you have to kind of go by  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:14:22):**  your area on your design sometimes.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:14:24):**  Does that answer your question?  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:14:27):**  It does yeah and so for the size and the dimensions that you mentioned for the pens how many rabbits  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:14:33):**  can you appropriately fit in there or is it just one rabbit per pen?  
**[0:14:39-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:14:39):**  Generally it's the pen for the doe and then her litter so we don't the doe gets the whole  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:14:49):**  pen by herself if she's just gestating and then you know we'll add the nest box in and  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:14:54):**  that's when the bigger pen is nice because that gives her room to move around with that  
**[0:14:58-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:14:58):**  nest box and not be you know crowded against it and also as the litter starts to grow gives  
**[0:15:05-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:15:05):**  them a bit more room.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:15:06):**  Well the nest boxes removed at about 17 to 21 days depending on what the weather is doing.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:15:15):**  The quicker you can get them out of that nest box the more sanitary things are have a tendency  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:15:21):**  for that to become a litter box.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:15:24):**  So you and 17 to 21 days you're going to have the nest box out and five to six weeks which  
**[0:15:31-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:15:31):**  is the normal period of when you want to get the babies weaned because the doe is going  
**[0:15:37-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:15:37):**  to wean those babies on her own.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:15:39):**  A lot of people leave them in longer because they think the babies are getting bigger often  
**[0:15:45-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:15:45):**  with the doe but it's actually pulling that doe down.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:15:47):**  They're starting they should be eating feed by then so you're going to pull them out of  
**[0:15:51-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:15:51):**  the pen split sex them into two more pens so you don't want to make your pens very big  
**[0:15:59-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:15:59):**  and when we've done workshops here a lot of people have made their pens really big and  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:16:06):**  then they have a hard time they can't reach in catch the rabbits.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:16:10):**  Especially if you're short like I am.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:16:14):**  He can reach into any corner of the pen but there's I have little T-Rex flipper arms so  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:16:20):**  I struggle a little bit with that.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:16:24):**  Nice so yeah so obviously the comfort of the rabbit but also the ease and the efficiency  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:16:28):**  of maintenance and harvesting is really important.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:16:32):**  Let's talk now about the nutrition because I know that's essential for raising healthy  
**[0:16:37-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:16:37):**  livestock of any kind.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:16:39):**  Give me an idea of the feed that you recommend and some ways to tell if your rabbits are  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:16:43):**  unhealthy or not growing correctly.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:16:48):**  The feed we use is made basically for us at a local co-op it's a 17% pelleted ration it  
**[0:16:58-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:16:58):**  is milo based so it doesn't have corn in it or anything like that so it's also higher  
**[0:17:06-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:17:06):**  in fiber which high fiber is essential for rabbit health.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:17:13):**  It's got alfalfa in it too.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:17:15):**  Alfalfa based so alfalfa is another good food for rabbit because it's high in protein and  
**[0:17:20-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:17:20):**  high in roughage so that keeps that digestive system working to its optimum.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:17:29):**  As far as knowing whether your diet is doing its job one of the handiest things that we  
**[0:17:38-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:17:38):**  recommend people do is get a scale.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:17:41):**  It doesn't have to be anything expensive but if you check your rabbit's weights and see  
**[0:17:49-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:17:49):**  that they're growing steadily that's a good indicator and also if they look shiny I mean  
**[0:17:57-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:17:57):**  a healthy rabbit just really shiny coat bright eyes they look active you can tell if they're  
**[0:18:07-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:18:07):**  listless and just kind of off that they're not feeling well.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:18:10):**  Well it'll all show in the production output of those animals.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:18:15):**  We initially in the beginning were not going to use a commercial feed and I found a actual  
**[0:18:26-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:18:26):**  ration mix out of a 1933 rabbit handbook and basically went to co-op and got all the ingredients  
**[0:18:35-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:18:35):**  it was whole wheat it was a lot of whole grains and you they had ground hay into it we bought  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:18:41):**  a PTO grinder mixer and started doing that.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:18:45):**  Well it became very hard to get small batches of grain from co-op because they would only  
**[0:18:51-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:18:51):**  open a bin up for 500 bushel and I only needed 50 pounds and so there were a lot of things  
**[0:18:58-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:18:58):**  that really weren't conducive to pursuing that and it was time-consuming labor-intensive  
**[0:19:07-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:19:07):**  and when we did use it what we found was the rabbits are very picky eaters they will they  
**[0:19:15-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:19:15):**  went through the feeders and basically raked out the more ground stuff like the hay and  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:19:22):**  things they didn't want to eat going after the whole grains well we ended up with more  
**[0:19:27-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:19:27):**  feed on the floor and if you put whole grains in with rabbit manure which is one of the  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:19:33):**  best fertilizers you can do I had better crops than some of the farmers around here which  
**[0:19:38-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:19:38):**  wasn't doing anything for us but and you also saw that rabbits were some would do fairly  
**[0:19:45-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:19:45):**  well on it and some were just weren't gaining any weight their body was lengthening out  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:19:52):**  but they weren't putting on any meat so as we got bigger and started going through at  
**[0:19:58-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:19:58):**  that time about a ton of feed a month we decided to abandon that and get on a more even plane  
**[0:20:07-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:20:07):**  and when you would go into harvest them all the rabbits in those pens would be ready to  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:20:13):**  harvest because they would be all around the same weight versus up and down you know pound  
**[0:20:18-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:20:18):**  two pound differences between them and we also saw that same thing when we did the experiment  
**[0:20:24-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:20:24):**  with the rabbits finished on pasture grass they all started out the same weight we saw  
**[0:20:31-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:20:31):**  some of them did okay we had to add some oats to the program to get a little more bloom  
**[0:20:38-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:20:38):**  on them so and it took instead of about fourteen twelve to fourteen weeks to get them to harvest  
**[0:20:45-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:20:45):**  it was about twenty six to twenty eight weeks when they were on grass so the longer you  
**[0:20:51-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:20:51):**  have to hope that those animals don't die on you or something gets them or you on a  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:20:59):**  grass program you need to hope that you don't have a drought like what happens here a lot  
**[0:21:05-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:21:05):**  anymore and have to come up with some other type of feed source and a pellet diet was  
**[0:21:11-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:21:11):**  initially designed in the beginning to make a balanced diet every time that animal takes  
**[0:21:16-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:21:16):**  a bite.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:21:19):**  Fantastic now so my biggest question after reading the book and this is just because  
**[0:21:23-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:21:23):**  I don't have experience with breeding rotations was figuring out it seemed like to me that  
**[0:21:29-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:21:29):**  was one of the more challenging aspects of the maintenance with rabbits could you explain  
**[0:21:33-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:21:33):**  the general rotation and timeline from breeding pairs to separation and sorting of baby kits  
**[0:21:40-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:21:40):**  all the way up to harvesting specifically the way that you do it.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:21:48):**  We're basically a closed herd and why we do that is it keeps us from possibly bringing  
**[0:21:55-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:21:55):**  in any outside diseases from other rabbitry so everything that we use in our breeding  
**[0:22:03-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:22:03):**  program has been raised here stays here until further notice so depending on the breed it's  
**[0:22:13-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:22:13):**  usually six seven eight months before you can breed them for the first time so from  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:22:20):**  birth to that period you've got that time to get them up to weight and condition to  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:22:26):**  breed them Chinchillas we found over the years it's the eight pound target window is perfect  
**[0:22:32-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:22:32):**  for them.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:22:33):**  A lot of them will sexually mature and you know four to five months but you don't want  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:22:40):**  to breed them at then and that's one of the reasons you have to split sex them and if  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:22:44):**  you would leave them in a group there's going to be a possibility of brother sister matings  
**[0:22:49-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:22:49):**  or bucks within a group fighting over competition and that can get pretty ugly so at about eight  
**[0:23:00-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:23:00):**  months you can get one into production and as soon as you get her bred it's about twenty  
**[0:23:07-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:23:07):**  eight to thirty two days you're going to have kits and then if everything goes right you're  
**[0:23:13-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:23:13):**  going to take care of those kits for about five to six weeks if things are going right  
**[0:23:19-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:23:19):**  and then you're going to wean those rabbits and at that time we keep numbers on we've  
**[0:23:28-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:23:28):**  got data here that we need an intern to go through and over the years of weights at different  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:23:35):**  times and all kinds of numbers but you're going to get the weights of those kits sex  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:23:40):**  those kits you're going to split them male female and two different pens and then you  
**[0:23:46-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:23:46):**  at that time if you're we breed year round it's a bottom line and production need most  
**[0:23:53-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:23:53):**  people will breed in spring and fall just so they don't have pregnant does in the extreme  
**[0:24:00-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:24:00):**  cold or the extreme heat and that so it depends on what program you want to go with but we'll  
**[0:24:09-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:24:09):**  get those does weaned and then if they're in condition they're ready to breed again  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:24:17):**  if you want to keep them in production and then you start over in 30 days or so she's  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:24:23):**  going to have another letter so those those babies are over there what you want to do  
**[0:24:29-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:24:29):**  with them is get keep some weights on them and at that time you want to start up your  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:24:37):**  in a operation that you want to keep replacements or sell breeding stock you're going to want  
**[0:24:42-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:24:42):**  to evaluate those rabbits between the time you wean them and we harvest at a live weight  
**[0:24:49-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:24:49):**  round six pounds so between that time frame you want to get those animals evaluated and  
**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:24:56):**  get rid of the worst and keep the best and so you're if you're going to do that you're  
**[0:25:00-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:25:00):**  going to need some more pens to keep those replacement animals separate so that's how  
**[0:25:08-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:25:08):**  you kind of start getting into a pair needs this many pens and then you can you want to  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:25:16):**  skip out just let that dough rest or have two letters then rest just depends on how  
**[0:25:22-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:25:22):**  many chores you want to do and how many animals you need and so I've I've worked with weaning  
**[0:25:29-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:25:29):**  the goats that we have on our farm here what's the weaning process like for rabbits generally  
**[0:25:35-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:25:35):**  it's what we do is when they're ready to be weaned we'll just go ahead and take the dough  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:25:43):**  out of the pin that way we're not moving the litter you know fewer rabbits to handle and  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:25:48):**  also that's their environment they know where the food and water and and everything is there  
**[0:25:54-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:25:54):**  so we leave the kits there take the dough either if she's going to be re-bred or rested  
**[0:26:01-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:26:01):**  or something like that and so that's that's pretty much how it works here and some some  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:26:08):**  doves are waiting for you to wean the babies the uh oat does well they're they'll tell  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:26:14):**  you when if you don't get their babies weaned they're going to start chewing on them and  
**[0:26:18-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:26:18):**  they just they they don't like having the babies on very long I'm sure there are a lot  
**[0:26:24-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:26:24):**  of parents that could understand that too but you don't with weaning rabbits I know  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:26:31):**  when we weaned goats you'll get that phase where you know the babies will yell for mom  
**[0:26:36-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:26:36):**  and mom will yell back and the the dough has to go through that process of drying up it's  
**[0:26:43-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:26:43):**  not like that for rabbits they mostly don't seem to really care one way or the other and  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:26:50):**  as long as the babies are eating food good you don't see you know any post weaning slump  
**[0:26:56-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:26:56):**  or anything like that by weaning time those babies all they're concerned about is food  
**[0:27:02-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:27:02):**  and water I mean they're they should have the litter is doing well and your feed program's  
**[0:27:06-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:27:06):**  working weaning rabbits should happen like nothing it just the dough goes out and life  
**[0:27:15-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:27:15):**  goes on I mean there's no the dough doesn't get into depression or anything and not breed  
**[0:27:23-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:27:23):**  it's it's a very simple process. And about how many years of breeding can you  
**[0:27:29-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:27:29):**  hope out of a out of a very healthy selected animal specifically for breeding?  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:27:38):**  Well it depends on how hard you want to push that dough if you're trying to get four or  
**[0:27:43-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:27:43):**  five litters a year out of her three to four years is going to be a good productive span  
**[0:27:50-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:27:50):**  if you are going for like say two or three that can probably add another year or so to  
**[0:27:57-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:27:57):**  her productive life but they they're an animal has a very fast metabolism a very fast turnover  
**[0:28:04-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:28:04):**  as far as you know but when the babies are born to when they can start breeding so everything  
**[0:28:10-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:28:10):**  just seems to be kind of speeded up with them you know being able to have multiple litters  
**[0:28:14-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:28:14):**  so you know four to five years I would say. Well nutrition has a big role to play in that  
**[0:28:21-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:28:21):**  if you keep a balanced diet sometimes we have a tendency it's human nature to a cheaper  
**[0:28:28-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:28:28):**  feed comes along or you know somebody sells you some magic feed you want to get on it  
**[0:28:35-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:28:35):**  we've been on the same feed since the beginning and it shows in the production of the animals  
**[0:28:42-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:28:42):**  and the animals that are in production your adult ones you want to give them like a little  
**[0:28:50-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:28:50):**  I use cap manna which is a feed supplement and I look at it as kind of a vitamin form  
**[0:28:57-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:28:57):**  you know you're getting a good feed but you're pulling a lot of extra things out of that  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:29:01):**  animal so there's things that you can do to keep them you know in top production you know  
**[0:29:06-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:29:06):**  an animal that's marginal you're gonna she's probably gonna skip letters on you even though  
**[0:29:12-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:29:12):**  you get her bred she's not gonna set a litter and so you're if you watch your animals and  
**[0:29:20-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:29:20):**  you know they're comfortable and you know we breeding year-round we've had animals in  
**[0:29:27-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:29:27):**  the extreme cold and extreme heat and it's you know a little bit of management stuff  
**[0:29:34-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:29:34):**  by the weather conditions but we don't do anything different you know and then feed  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:29:42):**  situation so everything's constant all right so let's talk a little bit about some of the  
**[0:29:47-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:29:47):**  numbers now I know you've got a fairly large operation with a couple hundred of pens what  
**[0:29:52-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:29:52):**  about for those people who are just looking to get started with possibly the minimal number  
**[0:29:58-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:29:58):**  to start breeding to start raising for meat possibly even for conservation how do you  
**[0:30:03-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:30:03):**  recommend that you get started possibly with as little as like two breeding pairs well  
**[0:30:10-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:30:10):**  two breeding pairs is a really good start that way you don't have to go outside for  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:30:17):**  additional breeding stock and if you a lot of people when they start will get a trio  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:30:22):**  which is just a buck and two does but if you're wanting to keep replacements then you're pretty  
**[0:30:28-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:30:28):**  much very quickly at a dead end because then you're breeding the father to his daughters  
**[0:30:34-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:30:34):**  so if you get a couple of pair that gives you quite a few more options as far as that  
**[0:30:40-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:30:40):**  and other than that I think we recommend people start small especially if they've never done  
**[0:30:47-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:30:47):**  it before a couple of pairs a great place to start and then you can always expand from  
**[0:30:55-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:30:55):**  there with the heritage conservation because you're trying to conserve bloodlines and working  
**[0:31:03-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:31:03):**  with a little bit shallower jeans pool so to speak you wind up you'll have to keep more  
**[0:31:11-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:31:11):**  males than you ordinarily would if you're just raising for me one rabbit one buck can  
**[0:31:18-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:31:18):**  take care of probably 10 to 12 does but if you're trying to do bloodline and keeping  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:31:26):**  replacements you're going to have to have more bucks I think I kind of went around it  
**[0:31:30-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:31:30):**  but does that answer your question no yeah definitely and so with that start what's the  
**[0:31:36-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:31:36):**  sort of infrastructure and kind of upfront costs and size that you're going to be needing  
**[0:31:42-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:31:42):**  with just those two breeding pairs off the bat well you know infrastructure if you if  
**[0:31:49-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:31:49):**  you're creative you can do a lot you know with some repurposed materials and stuff you  
**[0:31:55-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:31:55):**  will need some sort of shelter for the rabbits they can tolerate a pretty wide range of climate  
**[0:32:02-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:32:02):**  they do much better with cold weather than they do with hot so wherever you you know  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:32:07):**  put that building you're going to want to make sure it's get good ventilation if you  
**[0:32:12-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:32:12):**  have hot summers and conversely is protected from the worst of the elements in the winter  
**[0:32:20-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:32:20):**  but you'll need you'll need a pin for each of your adult breeding stock and then you're  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:32:26):**  going to need two to four pins for each of those letters so you can you know split sex  
**[0:32:31-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:32:31):**  them at at weaning and then have a pin for replacements so I think it winds up usually  
**[0:32:39-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:32:39):**  being about six pins for each breeding pair that makes sense and that's kind of like one  
**[0:32:46-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:32:46):**  thing to keep in mind with location for structures or whatever your project is going to be is  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:32:57):**  a rabbit's body temperature is around 100 degrees so I always look at the danger zone  
**[0:33:03-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:33:03):**  starting at about 80 and that I mean they'll do fine but you need to make sure that you've  
**[0:33:10-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:33:10):**  got from that 80 to 100 degrees that do I have air movement you know we use misters  
**[0:33:18-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:33:18):**  on the outside of the buildings here in the summer but that doesn't work when the humidity's  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:33:23):**  high so usually the best thing I tell people is to get you a high load thermometer and  
**[0:33:29-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:33:29):**  set it in the general area you want to put your structure shade will do you a tremendous  
**[0:33:35-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:33:35):**  amount of benefit and if you don't have that you'll want to use some type of ventilation  
**[0:33:43-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:33:43):**  between the animals and the roof whether it's wood or tin or bamboo or whatever you want  
**[0:33:51-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:33:51):**  to use there and you can also make it where the sides come off in the summer you have  
**[0:34:01-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:34:01):**  to keep predators in mind when you locate your final spot but the main thing is to kind  
**[0:34:10-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:34:10):**  of get a general idea what that environment's at before you start building and what type  
**[0:34:16-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:34:16):**  of building you're going to have to put it up which direction it faces I have a real  
**[0:34:20-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:34:20):**  good friend that raises chinchillas up in Canada and they're in an open front structure  
**[0:34:27-0:34:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:34:27):**  and he sent me some pictures the other day with snow all over and he does great with  
**[0:34:34-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:34:34):**  them it's just he's found the right spot and picked the animals that do good there so you  
**[0:34:40-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:34:40):**  can do a lot of pre-work before you you know sometimes have a tendency to get ahead of  
**[0:34:46-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:34:46):**  ourselves and and start building the pens and everything and then go oh this isn't the  
**[0:34:52-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:34:52):**  right pens and oh this isn't the right spot so a high-low thermometer will do you a lot  
**[0:34:58-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:34:58):**  of good to find a location and also down the road to use that thermometer to monitor what  
**[0:35:06-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:35:06):**  the temperatures are every day I mean that's it's an everyday situation when you not just  
**[0:35:12-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:35:12):**  rabbits but any animal when they become under your control they're dependent on you to make  
**[0:35:17-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:35:17):**  sure that their environments where it needs to be in and the noises around rabbits like  
**[0:35:23-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:35:23):**  everything to be consistent we have radios playing in all of our barns so when the noise  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:35:32):**  is always the same sometimes they don't like my radio station but you know you when you  
**[0:35:37-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:35:37):**  go in there you you spook one rabbit and they all spooked so you know you don't want to  
**[0:35:45-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:35:45):**  think your rabbit area is real real nice spot and then here's a dog pen within 30 feet so  
**[0:35:53-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:35:53):**  take all that into consideration yeah of course there's so many aspects of the well-being  
**[0:35:59-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:35:59):**  of animals and I think constant observation is the one reliable form that I've found for  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:36:05):**  keeping an eye on on the livestock that we have as well now let's switch gears just a  
**[0:36:10-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:36:10):**  little bit I'd like to talk about the market for rabbit products now obviously it'll be  
**[0:36:17-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:36:17):**  very different for where we are here in Guatemala but are there profits on other things from  
**[0:36:24-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:36:24):**  you know purebred rabbits for conservation meat and even things like pelts or even manure  
**[0:36:33-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:36:33):**  yes there are we have had a rabbit manure is basically gold as far as fertilizer we  
**[0:36:43-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:36:43):**  yeah if you can keep weed seeds and things out of it so that is definitely a market we  
**[0:36:47-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:36:47):**  have a nursery that comes out a couple times a year and gets a couple of trailer loads  
**[0:36:54-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:36:54):**  of manure we have a big pile of manure out behind the barns that we clean everything  
**[0:36:58-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:36:58):**  out and take the manure there once or twice a week and so we're able to sell that for  
**[0:37:08-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:37:08):**  the heritage breeds breeding stock can be a good a good additional market the thing  
**[0:37:16-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:37:16):**  I would advise people is just to not consider every rabbit that's born no matter what breed  
**[0:37:23-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:37:23):**  or how rare that breed might be as potential breeding stock you want to select the best  
**[0:37:29-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:37:29):**  and you definitely if you're going to sell breeding stock want to sell the best as far  
**[0:37:36-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:37:36):**  as health I wish I could find a market for pelts I have a freezer full of beautiful pelts  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:37:44):**  that I'm going to wind up tanning myself one of these days and then I'm just going to be  
**[0:37:48-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:37:48):**  kind of the crazy lady in the rabbit fur coat but we we've yet to really find a market that  
**[0:37:57-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:37:57):**  we could tap into for that a lot of the pelts that do get sold are white because they're  
**[0:38:04-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:38:04):**  easy to dye and you know that well like the chinchilla pelts and silver fox and some of  
**[0:38:11-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:38:11):**  those others are beautiful they're they're just we haven't found that niche yet I mean  
**[0:38:17-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:38:17):**  it's probably out there we just haven't found it fair enough oh ears yeah one other product  
**[0:38:23-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:38:23):**  we've been able to is we take the ears off of the pelts when it's harvested and those  
**[0:38:32-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:38:32):**  when dehydrated make great dog treats all natural dog treats and our dog loves them  
**[0:38:41-0:38:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:38:41):**  she will she'll do backflips for him and she's a lazy dog that's good to know we only just  
**[0:38:47-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:38:47):**  got a new dog here as well so maybe that's something that we can offer as a treat when  
**[0:38:51-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:38:51):**  we get our own ravatory started now tell me a little bit more about the importance of  
**[0:38:56-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:38:56):**  maintaining a clean environment for the herd and what are some of the most important things  
**[0:39:01-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:39:01):**  to consider for giving them that comfort that will help them to grow and not only maintain  
**[0:39:08-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:39:08):**  weight but just be healthy in other aspects as well I think probably one of the main things  
**[0:39:15-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:39:15):**  is keeping the manure cleaned up the manure will draw flies you know and rabbit urine  
**[0:39:24-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:39:24):**  is pretty strong it's highly concentrated got a lot of calcium and other things in it  
**[0:39:32-0:39:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:39:32):**  so it's a pretty strong and can get fumey real easily so I think keeping the manure  
**[0:39:40-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:39:40):**  out as much as possible trying to keep it from being wet under the pins will help create  
**[0:39:48-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:39:48):**  that environment because you know if you go into a building and you can smell a strong  
**[0:39:54-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:39:54):**  odor those animals are living with that 24-7 so I think air quality is a pretty big one  
**[0:40:03-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:40:03):**  that's another reason why we have you know windows all the way around the barn so that  
**[0:40:08-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:40:08):**  we can take advantage of natural ventilation and then while the wind does blow in Kansas  
**[0:40:13-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:40:13):**  probably 95% of the time for that 5% where it actually is still we've installed some  
**[0:40:21-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:40:21):**  fans to try to kind of help keep that air moving so I mean I think wouldn't you agree  
**[0:40:26-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:40:26):**  the air quality is probably one of the biggest comfort things for them.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:40:31):**  Well in the summertime too the rabbits kind of go in when it's hot they'll go into kind  
**[0:40:37-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:40:37):**  of a little zone they'll stretch out pretty much best they can and they radiate out their  
**[0:40:46-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:40:46):**  ears and I usually make sure that in the summertime when it's hot that chores are done by about  
**[0:40:54-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:40:54):**  10 30 11 and that's when it starts to get hot and you're not going in there and stressing  
**[0:41:01-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:41:01):**  them so they'll tell you if you keep an eye and it's not just rabbits if you keep an eye  
**[0:41:06-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:41:06):**  on your livestock they'll they're their best indicators of if things are going well if  
**[0:41:13-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:41:13):**  the air quality is good their temperature is good their feeds good you're going to have  
**[0:41:19-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:41:19):**  good producing animals and you'll profit from it instead of it being a liability and what  
**[0:41:26-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:41:26):**  the manure it stays wet and it's we take it out once a week so it's pretty imperative  
**[0:41:37-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:41:37):**  that you keep that manure out of there. Well fortunately it seems like there's so  
**[0:41:42-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:41:42):**  many good uses for it in the garden and for soil building as well so it can be treated  
**[0:41:46-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:41:46):**  easily as a resource. Now we've talked a lot about all the different types of maintenance  
**[0:41:52-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:41:52):**  and the things you need to be looking after with your rabbit herd what are some of the  
**[0:41:57-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:41:57):**  most useful tools and equipment that you have that helps to reduce maintenance in the rabbit  
**[0:42:02-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:42:02):**  tree as far as labor and time saving methods? Well the having the correct feeders the correct  
**[0:42:13-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:42:13):**  waters our rabbits that are being finished out are on a gravity water system that basically  
**[0:42:19-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:42:19):**  runs out of a reservoir and gravity flows down tubing to a rabbit nipple that keeps  
**[0:42:28-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:42:28):**  the water in front of them pretty much all the time. That works up until your weather  
**[0:42:36-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:42:36):**  gets to where it's freezing but if you are watching your your rabbits or any animal fairly  
**[0:42:43-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:42:43):**  close you'll know about how much water they'll consume so I'm still running our gravity water  
**[0:42:49-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:42:49):**  flow system now and we've had freezing temperatures but I know exactly how much water to put in  
**[0:42:55-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:42:55):**  that tank so it's completely drained out by the morning so and if you use equipment that  
**[0:43:02-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:43:02):**  doesn't take up pen space will give you more room for your animals a lot of times people  
**[0:43:09-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:43:09):**  put feed containers inside the pens water bowls things like that those become contaminated  
**[0:43:17-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:43:17):**  dumped so feeders on the outside of the pens there's all types of quart water bottles with  
**[0:43:25-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:43:25):**  nipples on them I like to use those on production animals does and bucks that way I can make  
**[0:43:33-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:43:33):**  sure that they're consuming water they're a clear jar the drawback with a reservoir  
**[0:43:41-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:43:41):**  system is a lot of times people become complacent with that they fill the tank up and it's like  
**[0:43:48-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:43:48):**  any other water system it can plug up and I think just because the tank has water in  
**[0:43:53-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:43:53):**  it everybody's getting water so you still need to visit every pen and touch that nipple  
**[0:44:00-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:44:00):**  to make sure it's running water because if they don't eat they don't drink so that can  
**[0:44:07-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:44:07):**  be a very useful tool but it can also be a crutch that you can go off and think well  
**[0:44:13-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:44:13):**  I put water in the tank and they got they have water when actually half of them may  
**[0:44:17-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:44:17):**  not so and you can spend you know any amount of money you want to on the quality of that  
**[0:44:26-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:44:26):**  there are different qualities of wire there's some a baby saver wire that you can use on  
**[0:44:33-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:44:33):**  your pens with doughs in them that the bottom two inches of the side wire has the same half  
**[0:44:40-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:44:40):**  by one inch wire so babies happen to get out of the nest box at birth they don't wiggle  
**[0:44:47-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:44:47):**  through and end up on the floor so it's just best thing to do is sit down and figure out  
**[0:44:55-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:44:55):**  what your plan is and start out very small and a lot of times it may be with local rabbits  
**[0:45:03-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:45:03):**  you can get to learn what you're doing because if you get into heritage breeds in the beginning  
**[0:45:11-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:45:11):**  with no rabbit experience they're going to cost more they're going to be harder to find  
**[0:45:15-0:45:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:45:15):**  and if you make a mistake or you know not by on purpose or anything but you're not going  
**[0:45:24-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:45:24):**  to be out a bunch of work and a bunch of money so and there's misters that can you know the  
**[0:45:33-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:45:33):**  same thing that you you get to put on your deck that doesn't consume a lot of water I  
**[0:45:40-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:45:40):**  usually take out every other orifice on it so it's not missed as much and you can also  
**[0:45:47-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:45:47):**  on one building next to our garden we have the misters actually misting some plants plus  
**[0:45:54-0:46:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:45:54):**  cooling the barn so if you kind of double think things you can utilize one piece of  
**[0:46:00-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:46:00):**  equipment for two projects. Nice yeah that's clever. Now let's take some time to talk about  
**[0:46:08-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:46:08):**  maybe the best part after the harvest. I love the chapter on how to cook and prepare rabbit  
**[0:46:13-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:46:13):**  meat. This is probably the thing that a lot of people are least familiar with because  
**[0:46:18-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:46:18):**  like you said rabbits are just not as popular for meat as they used to be earlier in the  
**[0:46:23-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:46:23):**  previous century. Could you describe some of your favorite dishes because I've cooked  
**[0:46:28-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:46:28):**  a lot of different types of food and I just haven't yet had the chance to cook with rabbit  
**[0:46:32-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:46:32):**  though I would like I do really like to eat it. What are some of your favorite things  
**[0:46:37-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:46:37):**  that you know will get people motivated to give this a try. Well one of the let me back  
**[0:46:44-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:46:44):**  up a second. The thing that most people need to keep in mind when cooking rabbit is it  
**[0:46:49-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:46:49):**  is very lean. There is no intramuscular fat or marbling or anything like that. So there's  
**[0:46:57-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:46:57):**  barely any external fat. So you've got to use a cooking method that's going to allow  
**[0:47:03-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:47:03):**  that rabbit to cook at a lower temperature and stay moist. So one way that we cook rabbit  
**[0:47:13-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:47:13):**  a lot of times is I've got a old cast iron Dutch oven and we can put a rabbit in that  
**[0:47:21-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:47:21):**  put it in the oven at about 200 degrees. It stays nice and moist cooks pretty evenly all  
**[0:47:28-0:47:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:47:28):**  the way through and is pretty delicious. You can put all sorts of seasoning peppers anything  
**[0:47:34-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:47:34):**  like that. But one of the favorite ways is we've got a grill that has a rotisserie attachment  
**[0:47:41-0:47:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:47:41):**  on it. And so what Eric will do is take some zesty Italian dressing and some butter melted  
**[0:47:48-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:47:48):**  butter mix that together and use that to baste the rabbit and he'll also we've got one of  
**[0:47:57-0:48:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:47:57):**  those injection kits where you can like inject the marinade into the meat. So use that put  
**[0:48:04-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:48:04):**  it on the rotisserie and honestly half the time the rabbit doesn't make it into the house  
**[0:48:10-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:48:10):**  because we'll just sit outside and eat it like a pair of carnivores. But it's real tender  
**[0:48:18-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:48:18):**  and super delicious. And then what was the other way? Smoking them is also I like to  
**[0:48:24-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:48:24):**  basically butterfly them not split them in half but cut them so you can butterfly them  
**[0:48:30-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:48:30):**  and then hang them in a smoker. And you can use various woods that you know add a little  
**[0:48:37-0:48:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:48:37):**  flavor but smoking works pretty good. You can pretty much anything you can do with a  
**[0:48:43-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:48:43):**  chicken recipe you can do with rabbit. But the main thing is that there's no that skins  
**[0:48:53-0:48:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:48:53):**  not there like on a chicken so you don't have that room for air when you get the heat too  
**[0:48:59-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:48:59):**  high so it's slow and flavored however you know just kind of experiment whether we do  
**[0:49:06-0:49:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:49:06):**  rabbit stir-fry rabbit chili you know you can debone one of those down and make unbelievable  
**[0:49:17-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:49:17):**  amount of meals. But the chefs we've worked with over the years have we have one that  
**[0:49:26-0:49:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:49:26):**  he's our biggest customer and about the time I think he's run out of rabbit recipes he  
**[0:49:33-0:49:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:49:33):**  comes up with something else and we've been with him 10 years and the last one I think  
**[0:49:40-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:49:40):**  it really got me was the rabbit and banana leaves. So it's the creativity is out there  
**[0:49:48-0:49:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:49:48):**  it's just that you have to get people over that initial shock that oh rabbit but after  
**[0:49:53-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:49:53):**  they tasted it you know smoked loins it's just I'm hungry now.  
**[0:49:59-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:49:59):**  Yeah it all sounds fantastic. We've got a lot of banana leaves around here and it's  
**[0:50:06-0:50:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:50:06):**  a pretty common way for people to cook tamales and other traditional dishes I'm sure the  
**[0:50:12-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:50:12):**  addition of rabbit meat as a replacement for maybe chicken or others would be fantastic  
**[0:50:17-0:50:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:50:17):**  in that and frankly the recipe that first got me interested in eating rabbit I was in  
**[0:50:22-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:50:22):**  Morocco and they had it in a traditional tagine the one of the more traditional meals from  
**[0:50:29-0:50:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:50:29):**  Morocco and I mean it was like a half rabbit complete with skeleton and all and there are  
**[0:50:36-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:50:36):**  a lot of squeamish people around there like oh my goodness what is that but it was fantastic  
**[0:50:40-0:50:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:50:40):**  and since then I've been interested in integrating it more into our diet.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:50:47):**  It's a wonderful meat it's high in protein it's so lean easily digestible it's I mean  
**[0:50:55-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:50:55):**  it's fantastic. Nice so before I let you go could you both  
**[0:51:00-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:51:00):**  give us a way for people to contact you and how they can find the book to get the rest  
**[0:51:06-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:51:06):**  of the information because there are so many great visual aids in there to help clarify  
**[0:51:10-0:51:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:51:10):**  some of the instructions and ways of checking in on rabbits I really found this a fantastic  
**[0:51:15-0:51:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:51:15):**  resource. Well thank you I appreciate that. The best  
**[0:51:20-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:51:20):**  way to get a copy of the book is through the New Society Publishers website they have it  
**[0:51:26-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:51:26):**  available there and as far as contacting us we were fairly active on Facebook the rare  
**[0:51:34-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:51:34):**  hare barn is our Facebook page and an email address is rarehairbarn at gmail.com but be  
**[0:51:44-0:51:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:51:44):**  patient with email sometimes it takes me a couple of days life comes at you fast but  
**[0:51:49-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:51:49):**  I will get back to you at some point. Wonderful well thank you both so much for

**[0:51:59-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:51:59):**  was after reading the book so I'm sure the listeners will as well so y'all take care

**[0:52:09-0:52:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:52:09):**  own rabbitry here on the farm in a later season. That would be great I'd love to do that.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-raising-rabbits-for-meat/#t=0:52:14):**  Alright thanks so much and I'll talk to you soon bye.

**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:00:00):**  This is Regenerative Skills, the podcast helping you to learn the skills and solutions to create  
**[0:00:08-0:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:00:08):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:00:10):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gautier.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:00:12):**  So I know there's a lot of buzz and interest around agroforestry and food forest these  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:00:18):**  days, but do you really know what the difference is between an orchard and a food forest?  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:00:23):**  Or how to choose the right species for your climate and soil conditions?  
**[0:00:27-0:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:00:27):**  How about companion plants in the various strata of a forest?  
**[0:00:30-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:00:30):**  And if you're looking to make money and sell products, how can you make a business  
**[0:00:33-0:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:00:33):**  plan and calculate expenses and profit from a system that could take years to mature?  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:00:39):**  Luckily, my friend Jacob Evans and I will be covering all of that and more in our upcoming

**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:00:46):**  In the beautiful setting of the Spanish coastal mountains, Jacob and I will take you through  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:00:50):**  the practical learning experience of designing and planning all the way to putting plants  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:00:54):**  in the ground for a profitable, centropic agroforestry enterprise.

**[0:01:17-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:01:17):**  to go, I can help you out there too.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:01:20):**  If your project is located anywhere in continental Europe, you can get the trees you're thinking  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:01:24):**  of planting and a group of volunteers to help you out to get them in the ground absolutely

**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:01:29):**  I've connected with the team at Life Terra to help them reach their goal of growing 500  
**[0:01:33-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:01:33):**  million trees all over Europe in the next couple of years.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:01:36):**  It's an ambitious goal and we need your help!

**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:02:01):**  works.

**[0:02:07-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:02:07):**  Hey everybody and welcome back!  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:02:09):**  Now in this ongoing series on building strong communities, we've already taken a look  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:02:13):**  at the buildings and infrastructure that are more conducive to regenerative living and  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:02:17):**  connected populations, but I want to return to a broader range of context and applications  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:02:22):**  from around the world in this episode.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:02:25):**  Now much like the first session from the series, back with Zach Weiss, in which he profiled  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:02:29):**  amazing examples from around the globe of communities who have come together to achieve  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:02:33):**  incredible transformations of their ecosystem through landscape hydrology restoration, there  
**[0:02:38-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:02:38):**  are so many case studies around the world to draw from.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:02:41):**  In my own travels, I've witnessed inspiring groups of people who've overcome massive  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:02:45):**  disadvantages such as a lack of access to materials or funds, and even antagonistic  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:02:50):**  governments by banding together in their common vision of a better life and future.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:02:56):**  Some of the most notable projects I remember from an earlier stage in my work when I designed  
**[0:03:00-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:03:00):**  and built natural homes.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:03:02):**  There were technical skill training programs for single mothers and disadvantaged youths  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:03:06):**  to give them higher wage and job opportunities when I lived on Lake Atitlan in Guatemala.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:03:11):**  Now a few of the graduates of that program worked side by side with me on natural building  
**[0:03:16-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:03:16):**  projects and even ran restaurants that I frequented.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:03:19):**  In the same area, I also worked with a clinic that had a low-cost home building program,  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:03:23):**  which worked with the residents around them to identify the most vulnerable people living  
**[0:03:28-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:03:28):**  there and to build stable housing for them.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:03:31):**  Back when I was in Senegal, my Dutch clients worked with their local fishing community  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:03:35):**  to create communal meeting spaces near the dilapidated fishing docks in a renovation  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:03:40):**  effort and art project, and they also helped to establish a fresh food market run by the  
**[0:03:45-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:03:45):**  women at the entrance of the town.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:03:48):**  Here in Spain, I visited a hotel and ranch that are working with local authorities to  
**[0:03:53-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:03:53):**  manage the forest in their area to reduce fire risk by harvesting discarded wood to  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:03:59):**  turn into mushroom substrate, an enterprise that also works with at-risk youth from Barcelona  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:04:04):**  to give vocational training and is also hired from inside that group.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:04:09):**  So many of my collaborators and clients from around the world have exemplified community  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:04:13):**  collaboration and outreach, and I've often wondered if there is a playbook that one could  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:04:17):**  access to begin the nuanced process of bringing people together to work towards common goals.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:04:23):**  Now luckily for me, the new book by Dr. James Gruber called Building Community, 12 Principles  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:04:29):**  for a Healthy Future, does exactly that, and I reached out to the author, who prefers to  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:04:34):**  go by Jim, to get his take on the steps in this process.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:04:39):**  Now the book profiles tons of exceptional examples of community projects from around  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:04:43):**  the world, some of which Jim has studied and others of which he was involved with directly  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:04:47):**  and helped to facilitate in his role as a community consultant.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:04:51):**  In this interview, we talk about some of the most important considerations when first approaching  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:04:56):**  a community-based project.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:04:58):**  Jim outlines many of the key steps that nearly all of the case studies that he's seen have  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:05:03):**  in common and are not to be skipped if long-term success is what you're after.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:05:08):**  He also shares inspiring anecdotes from his facilitation role and observations of the  
**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:05:13):**  process unfolding organically in many different places.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:05:17):**  Jim also gives insight into his toolbox of leadership strategies that are meant to guide  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:05:22):**  newcomers of community development to help ensure that your project gets off started  
**[0:05:27-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:05:27):**  on the right foot.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:05:28):**  Oh, and a quick bonus for those of you who really want to dive deeper into community  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:05:32):**  building, my good friends at New Society who publish this book are offering a giveaway  
**[0:05:37-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:05:37):**  for listeners of this show, so just stick around until the end of this episode and I'll  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:05:41):**  tell you just how you can get a free copy of Building Community for yourself.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:05:46):**  And a little disclaimer before we get started, I had a short delay on my side of the connection  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:05:50):**  at the beginning of this interview, so you'll hear me sort of clumsily interrupt Jim a few  
**[0:05:55-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:05:55):**  times at the start.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:05:56):**  Luckily, this doesn't last for too long, so please forgive me for bungling the flow of  
**[0:06:01-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:06:01):**  things at the beginning.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:06:02):**  And from there, I will hand things over to Jim Gruber.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:06:07):**  Of all the community projects that you profiled in your book Building Community, which of  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:06:12):**  the ones stood out to you the most for their unique approach to uniting people?  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:06:17):**  Well, there's two different types.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:06:20):**  Ones the ones I was directly involved with and ones that I indirectly involved with.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:06:24):**  And so I'll start with the ones I didn't personally get involved with, but I thought was really  
**[0:06:28-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:06:28):**  unique.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:06:29):**  And the one in Baltimore, where they were able to get early release prisoners, because  
**[0:06:34-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:06:34):**  there's too much incarceration, to come out and to re deconstruct these row houses, save  
**[0:06:41-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:06:41):**  the materials, which is ecological, supported by the US Forest Service to save trees to  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:06:47):**  be cut to all the timbers, and then rebuild the other homes to rebuild the community itself.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:06:53):**  And all those factors I thought was incredible.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:06:56):**  Social justice, environmental, building social capital, it was all there.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:07:00):**  So that was good, but I didn't do it.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:07:02):**  So that I didn't do that directly.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:07:06):**  And the ones that you have been directly directly involved in, what are some of the emergent  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:07:11):**  properties that you have noticed that set them apart in their ability to connect people  
**[0:07:16-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:07:16):**  and build community?  
**[0:07:18-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:07:18):**  Well, I, I think one of my most visceral projects was working with the country of Bulgaria,  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:07:26):**  with the ministry.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:07:27):**  It was a national project, but it was working with local governments on shifting from and  
**[0:07:32-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:07:32):**  helping the country create their first national environmental policy.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:07:36):**  So but the goal was to bring all the local community members together through large gatherings  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:07:42):**  to see how they can shift from their incredible environmental problems after nearly 50 years  
**[0:07:47-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:07:47):**  of Soviet Russian totalitarian type rule into an area where all these kids came out, they  
**[0:07:55-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:07:55):**  wanted to start recycling.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:07:57):**  They had the first public hearing where they sat and listened to the public and the public  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:08:01):**  screamed and then the public started listening and the public started thanking them.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:08:05):**  And there was new bonds being built within the communities between the communities and  
**[0:08:09-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:08:09):**  the national government and change.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:08:11):**  So that was, that was a three year community project from here.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:08:14):**  I had like 10, 15 graduate students working on the project.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:08:19):**  So that was really interesting for me.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:08:21):**  For sure.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:08:22):**  But then the Baltic states were very interesting.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:08:24):**  They created their first community foundations where they actually came together in big forums  
**[0:08:29-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:08:29):**  and the mayor said, oh, they'll just fight.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:08:32):**  No, we'll bring them together and we'll see where they want to go, where their vision  
**[0:08:35-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:08:35):**  was, not complaining.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:08:38):**  And we have community foundations now all over the three Baltic countries helping.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:08:43):**  That's what I was involved with directly was interesting.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:08:47):**  And actually let's take a step back here because I'm curious to know how you got into a line  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:08:51):**  of work that has got you studying the way that communities function and the way that  
**[0:08:56-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:08:56):**  projects can come together in order to build these types of connections.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:09:00):**  Well from my work in Bulgaria, I was invited by the World Bank Foundation, which is a more  
**[0:09:06-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:09:06):**  progressive arm of the World Bank.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:09:08):**  The conference that Eleanor Ostrom facilitated, you know, Eleanor Ostrom, she's the first  
**[0:09:14-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:09:14):**  woman who won the Nobel Prize for economics.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:09:17):**  It was all about building the commons, collaboration and indigenous people.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:09:24):**  So I was there at that conference with 200 people from around the world sharing what  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:09:28):**  they did to build community based environmental programs in their countries.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:09:35):**  And that's what got me started.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:09:37):**  Now you said you also worked with government.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:09:41):**  This is obviously a tricky and more pragmatic part of working with communities and making  
**[0:09:46-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:09:46):**  them work.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:09:47):**  Can you tell us about that as well?  
**[0:09:49-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:09:49):**  Well government's always afraid to give up power.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:09:52):**  And that's even democracy.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:09:53):**  However, from my training at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, the whole idea is  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:09:58):**  getting people to give up some power and grow their authorizing environment, their support  
**[0:10:04-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:10:04):**  to get something done.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:10:05):**  Because government never has the kind of really except totalitarianism, the kind of tools  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:10:09):**  to force things.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:10:11):**  So that whole process, so in Vermont, I was managing a town, and we wanted to shut down  
**[0:10:19-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:10:19):**  some dumps and build a recycling center and get everyone together.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:10:21):**  And there was no support by the elected leaders.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:10:25):**  So we started building a broad groundswell of support.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:10:29):**  And by the end of this whole process, the leaders who did not support closing dumps  
**[0:10:34-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:10:34):**  and building recycling facilities and household hazardous waste facilities came back and said,  
**[0:10:37-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:10:37):**  we worked hard to make this work.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:10:39):**  So we changed their whole attitude and brought them along by working from the bottom up.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:10:45):**  And that actually got us a word from Hillary Clinton and the congressional record on how  
**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:10:49):**  to change attitudes by getting people together and building trust.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:10:55):**  So I really enjoy that.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:10:56):**  So that's what I like doing.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:10:58):**  So I've taught this, after years of work, I taught at the university.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:11:03):**  That is really remarkable.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:11:04):**  And it seems even more special nowadays when people really struggle to come together when  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:11:10):**  there are differences, when we're talking about our political climate, and people who  
**[0:11:15-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:11:15):**  are able to bring vast groups and diverse groups together really have a place and are  
**[0:11:22-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:11:22):**  especially needed now.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:11:23):**  What are some of the key skills that you have found that are required for creating that  
**[0:11:28-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:11:28):**  unity?  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:11:30):**  Well, what we have found is that if you get people together and all you want to talk about  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:11:35):**  is problems, all the oxygen will be sucked out of the room.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:11:40):**  The first step, and this is to build trust and build a positive social norms among the  
**[0:11:45-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:11:45):**  participants.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:11:47):**  That means including everyone in the process.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:11:49):**  So getting a lot of people in the room, sometimes I had 150, 200 people in the room of different  
**[0:11:54-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:11:54):**  backgrounds trying to come up with a shared vision.  
**[0:11:57-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:11:57):**  You've got to start where people want to go.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:11:59):**  What is a shared vision?  
**[0:12:00-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:12:00):**  And there's processes, there's a future search process, it's a different process, but getting  
**[0:12:04-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:12:04):**  people to say where they want to go and then getting them to trust through that process  
**[0:12:11-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:12:11):**  of sharing.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:12:12):**  And then the final thing is once they have agreed, we want to go here and here, this  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:12:16):**  is what we want for our future, a shared future.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:12:18):**  Then the question is, what are the barriers?  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:12:20):**  What are the psychological, economic, social barriers and how they could take them on piece  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:12:25):**  by piece, getting early wins and building that kind of collaborative energy to continue  
**[0:12:30-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:12:30):**  on.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:12:33):**  That's the approach that I have found, others I've worked with have found and working together.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:12:38):**  Now in your book, you outline 12 principles for community building and the first principle  
**[0:12:44-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:12:44):**  is to involve everyone.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:12:46):**  Now of course this seems super obvious, but in practice, it can be very hard to genuinely  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:12:50):**  include everyone's voice when it comes to planning and decision-making.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:12:54):**  What are some of the strategies that you've picked up to ensure that certain people are  
**[0:12:58-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:12:58):**  not left out of the conversation?  
**[0:13:01-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:13:01):**  That is a very good question.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:13:03):**  That means first thing, you make it accessible.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:13:06):**  So for example, some of the efforts to bring seniors in, you don't do it in the evening  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:13:10):**  or to bring young parents in, you don't do it without childcare.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:13:14):**  You think about the sectors you want to get in there.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:13:16):**  That means also possible transportation for those who have transportation.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:13:21):**  So if you put a notice in the paper, say we're having this big meeting, you'll be guaranteed  
**[0:13:25-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:13:25):**  only three or four people will show up.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:13:27):**  But if you spend two or three months working with local groups that are connected with  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:13:31):**  these people that they trust and say, we'd like you to come by from the seniors, from  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:13:36):**  this indigenous group, if you work through the communities of trust and bring them together,  
**[0:13:41-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:13:41):**  you could get most of the people in the room.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:13:44):**  Yes, not necessarily everyone, but most of them.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:13:48):**  And then equally important is those who have power, particularly when I work in Eastern  
**[0:13:52-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:13:52):**  Europe, terrify those who don't have power.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:13:56):**  So you have to have a system so those who don't have a lot of power can speak their  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:14:00):**  mind and not get retribution for those who have power.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:14:04):**  So the structure is also important to protect those who are powerless or have very little  
**[0:14:08-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:14:08):**  power.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:14:09):**  Can you give me one example from the book perhaps of a case study where bringing in  
**[0:14:15-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:14:15):**  otherwise un-included voices from previous parts really caused a change or a big leap  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:14:21):**  of progress in moving something forward?  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:14:25):**  Well, sometimes we even put an empty chair in the room saying these are the people that  
**[0:14:31-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:14:31):**  we couldn't get here.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:14:32):**  And what would they say?  
**[0:14:34-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:14:34):**  But an example is we have, they were doubling the size of the interstate highway from Boston  
**[0:14:43-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:14:43):**  area up into New Hampshire.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:14:45):**  Lot of litigation.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:14:46):**  Everyone was suing everybody because they're concerned about how it would impact the ecological  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:14:50):**  systems of New Hampshire, growth, costs, all those things.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:14:56):**  And so local government people, nonprofits, the environmental groups were all feeling  
**[0:15:01-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:15:01):**  disempowered and everyone was suing.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:15:04):**  So the state tried to do a program, expert driven program.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:15:09):**  This is how we'll train everyone to plan for growth.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:15:12):**  And everyone said, we'll just sue you.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:15:14):**  So we went to them and asked them, we looked at their stuff and says, you did great.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:15:18):**  Your ideas are very useful, but you should throw out the entire year of work and start  
**[0:15:23-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:15:23):**  over.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:15:25):**  And they invited us back after a week of thinking about that.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:15:28):**  And the approach was to start from the bottom.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:15:31):**  Let each NGO identify who they think should be there, social, environmental, so forth.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:15:37):**  Let the local governments choose their representatives.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:15:39):**  Let the federal governments and regional governments choose their people.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:15:44):**  And we got them in the room.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:15:45):**  And then at that point, we were able to make serious progress on what people really were  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:15:51):**  concerned about, what their vision was and what they needed to do.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:15:55):**  And they came up with a practical plan.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:15:57):**  They agreed upon how to spend the first $2 million to plan for growth unanimously across  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:16:02):**  27 local governments, federal governments, NGOs, environmental, social, because they  
**[0:16:07-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:16:07):**  were all building trust.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:16:09):**  One guy said to me, Gruber, I didn't like it, you made me sit at this table with this  
**[0:16:16-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:16:16):**  state person and blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:16:19):**  And then he writes, thank you.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:16:21):**  They had a lot to share.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:16:22):**  We really liked each other and I never liked them before.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:16:25):**  So that's the sort of, you have to push people to embrace each other in the process.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:16:32):**  And everyone's different.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:16:33):**  So I've kind of gone on too far, but that's, that's what I wanted.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:16:35):**  No, no, that's a fantastic example.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:16:37):**  And it does go to show that though there are so many perceived differences before we start  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:16:41):**  to communicate, oftentimes those can be broken down by connecting over things that we have  
**[0:16:46-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:16:46):**  in common and looking at ways where everyone can win in the solutions that the group comes  
**[0:16:53-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:16:53):**  up with so that people aren't left out.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:16:55):**  Right?  
**[0:16:56-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:16:56):**  Exactly.  
**[0:16:57-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:16:57):**  And then you do some early wins.  
**[0:16:58-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:16:58):**  You got your vision.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:16:59):**  Okay.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:17:00):**  What, what, what is the lowest?  
**[0:17:01-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:17:01):**  What are the things we could do now that we have the resources?  
**[0:17:04-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:17:04):**  Get some wins.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:17:05):**  Because people say, well, we don't have the money, we don't have the time.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:17:09):**  You need some early wins.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:17:10):**  People need positive feedback loops.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:17:13):**  And that process also builds what I think is probably the most important principle in  
**[0:17:17-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:17:17):**  the entire book is building a positive social foundation or social norms.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:17:24):**  Norms drive the system.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:17:26):**  So for example, I've been to Ukraine, we had a Ukraine daughter.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:17:30):**  The positive norms in Ukraine were growing since they got freedom from the totalitarian  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:17:37):**  communist regimes, Russia, over the last 30 years.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:17:41):**  Today, those positive norms is what, what is embracing their effort to save their freedom,  
**[0:17:48-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:17:48):**  their right to have their own country.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:17:52):**  And those norms, besides in a case like Ukraine, you see that in many communities.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:17:57):**  When the norms are negative, it's hard to do anything.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:18:01):**  When you have positive norms, which include things such as supportive social justice and  
**[0:18:07-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:18:07):**  say equity, looking at the long-term ecological conditions are important, not just short-term  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:18:13):**  extraction of resources.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:18:17):**  Those positive norms really drive future change.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:18:23):**  And so how do you start to establish those positive norms?  
**[0:18:26-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:18:26):**  It sounds like something that takes quite a while to really get ingrained into a culture,  
**[0:18:32-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:18:32):**  especially if they're working from negative ones.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:18:34):**  Well, as I mentioned earlier, the first thing you do is you try to get a diversity of those  
**[0:18:41-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:18:41):**  who are in conflict and everyone else in the room.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:18:43):**  And then you have a structure.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:18:45):**  You say, okay, where do we want this community to be in 10, 20 years, not a hundred years,  
**[0:18:50-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:18:50):**  10, 20 years.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:18:51):**  And people say, well, I want this.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:18:54):**  I want it safe on the street.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:18:55):**  I want to be treated equally.  
**[0:18:58-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:18:58):**  And how do we do that?  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:18:59):**  So you create the vision first.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:19:03):**  And then you find parts of that vision they all agree with.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:19:05):**  They won't agree on all of this, but they'll agree on parts of it.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:19:09):**  One person said on the interstate highway from Boston to New Hampshire, what he wanted  
**[0:19:14-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:19:14):**  was 10 acres in 10 minutes.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:19:16):**  And I said, what does that mean?  
**[0:19:19-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:19:19):**  Just write it up.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:19:20):**  So I wrote it back.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:19:21):**  10 acres, 10 minutes.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:19:22):**  I wanted everyone to have access to 10 open acres space within 10 minutes of their home.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:19:27):**  And that drove part of how we get to there.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:19:31):**  Find some commonality.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:19:33):**  Is that right?  
**[0:19:35-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:19:35):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:19:36):**  I've got you there.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:19:39):**  And so you've got an excerpt there in chapter six, which is on supporting research.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:19:44):**  And it talks about how it's important to ask the right questions.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:19:48):**  And this is something that's particularly interesting to me, as you can see from doing  
**[0:19:51-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:19:51):**  a podcast.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:19:52):**  What are some of the questions that it takes to open up dialogue and get people talking  
**[0:19:57-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:19:57):**  who perhaps normally are not used to contributing in spaces like this?  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:20:00):**  Well, I have a lot of PhD students over the years doing research in other countries, international  
**[0:20:05-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:20:05):**  students.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:20:06):**  And we do what we call engaged scholarship.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:20:09):**  We don't do research on people.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:20:12):**  We don't allow students to do research on people, gather data, take it off and get their  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:20:16):**  PhD.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:20:17):**  No.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:20:18):**  We allow them to engage with what are their concerns about this issue, whether it's climate  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:20:23):**  change or flooding, what are their concerns?  
**[0:20:27-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:20:27):**  And start at that point.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:20:29):**  I guess the most difficult thing for most people to do is to truly listen, keep listening  
**[0:20:36-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:20:36):**  and not filtering everything through your own lenses.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:20:41):**  That's not easy.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:20:42):**  I have some international students are very angry with what their country did to impoverished  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:20:47):**  people and they're trying to find research to document that.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:20:51):**  And I try to get them, no, get away from your already, I understand you were abused, but  
**[0:20:56-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:20:56):**  how can you actually listen?  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:20:58):**  So you get everyone's what they're saying down and then work from that.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:21:03):**  So listening is actually the hardest part.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:21:05):**  And many political litters can't listen.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:21:07):**  They already made up their mind.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:21:08):**  They pull people together to sell them their ideas.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:21:12):**  And that's the backward approach that doesn't work.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:21:15):**  It may work, it could be a lot of power.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:21:17):**  It doesn't work in society where you have positive foundational norms.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:21:22):**  Can you give me some example of, let's say questions that have worked for you that are  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:21:28):**  kind of, I don't want to say generic, but maybe get the conversation started.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:21:33):**  Here's a good idea.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:21:34):**  We're doing climate change issue.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:21:37):**  We don't go and say, we're here to do climate change and help you solve the climate problem.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:21:42):**  We, we show up and say, okay, we want, we understand you have some serious flooding  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:21:47):**  issues.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:21:48):**  We want to find out what you think are changing in the environment, in the weather around  
**[0:21:52-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:21:52):**  you.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:21:53):**  And we're not, we don't even use the word climate change.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:21:56):**  And people stand up, whether the Republicans or Democrats or whatever it is.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:22:00):**  And they say, well, the road agent stands up and says, you know, we have all this gravel  
**[0:22:05-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:22:05):**  flowing down the roads now and going into the lake.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:22:07):**  We didn't used to have that.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:22:08):**  I've been doing this job for 30 years.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:22:09):**  Now I could stand for two hours and give a lecture on climate change by that road agent  
**[0:22:14-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:22:14):**  in that town saying things are different now.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:22:17):**  And someone says, yeah, I noticed this too.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:22:19):**  These homes on the Hill are causing all this mud sliding coming down.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:22:23):**  So they, so that's an example of climate change.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:22:27):**  Another one in Bulgaria, they wanted us to go in there and tell them what was wrong with  
**[0:22:30-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:22:30):**  their solid waste system for the country.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:22:32):**  And we said, we don't know.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:22:34):**  We know what we did.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:22:36):**  We know what worked and what didn't work, but we don't know.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:22:38):**  So we're going to, we're not going to teach you what's wrong.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:22:41):**  We're going to get you together and have you choose panel to identify what you want to  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:22:46):**  share from the panel and what's wrong with the current system in Bulgaria.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:22:51):**  And then they stand up and say, we're killing the young because we're burning toxic waste  
**[0:22:56-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:22:56):**  here.  
**[0:22:57-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:22:57):**  They're breathing it.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:22:58):**  And that's, that's going to a water supply here.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:23:00):**  Things that I could have never said.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:23:02):**  They said, the Bulgarian said, when we asked them to share what the problems were, they  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:23:07):**  said, quote, low culture.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:23:10):**  We have low culture.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:23:11):**  We have to change our culture.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:23:12):**  Can you imagine that someone from the States coming in and said, well, you've got to improve  
**[0:23:17-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:23:17):**  your culture.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:23:18):**  You see what I mean?  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:23:20):**  So the question is, you've got to push it back and say, you identify what the issues  
**[0:23:24-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:23:24):**  are.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:23:25):**  And that makes all the difference because then they own it, their issue.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:23:29):**  It's how they say it to us more important.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:23:31):**  It's not just the issue.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:23:33):**  So in the climate change case, they came together and they realized that they had to make change.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:23:37):**  And they started saying, yeah, it's probably related to China climate change, but we see  
**[0:23:41-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:23:41):**  it here.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:23:42):**  And so they got five towns to work together because the five towns all around this large  
**[0:23:46-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:23:46):**  water body, they're all putting it.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:23:49):**  So that's, that's the approach or in Albania, we had a Lake Orhead, which is on the Albania  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:23:57):**  Macedonia border.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:23:58):**  I was there with, I had a workshop on how to conserve the Lake because they're efficient  
**[0:24:03-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:24:03):**  with dynamite, for example.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:24:04):**  No joke.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:24:05):**  They're throwing dynamite in.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:24:07):**  Oh no, I've seen that.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:24:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:24:10):**  So, so I had, so in three languages, Albania, Macedonian and English, we had a brainstorm  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:24:16):**  of what they, why they value this Lake that they're doing these things to.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:24:21):**  And from both cultures, they said, it's a gift from God.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:24:25):**  Okay.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:24:27):**  And they realized they had a gift from God, both from Macedonians, from Albanians.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:24:30):**  And they had to do something to save that gift from God.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:24:33):**  It was their ecological system.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:24:34):**  There's food supply and support.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:24:36):**  So you've got to get them to come out and share.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:24:40):**  Yeah, that makes so much sense.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:24:42):**  And it also helps me to understand better some of the contexts that I've lived in around  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:24:47):**  the world, where there has been a very heavy presence of social projects, both from governments  
**[0:24:52-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:24:52):**  and from non-government agencies.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:24:55):**  And I have observed, certainly there are some effective ones, but it wasn't the norm where  
**[0:24:59-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:24:59):**  people from outside of the culture, outside of the country come in with an agenda of what  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:25:04):**  they want to happen, what they need to improve.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:25:07):**  I'm sure you've seen this a lot as well.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:25:08):**  I've seen it.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:25:09):**  When the money's gone, everything collapses.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:25:13):**  Go back to how it was.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:25:14):**  Exactly.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:25:15):**  Exactly.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:25:16):**  The cases in Africa, all the African cases, local Africans wrote these cases, how we did  
**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:25:20):**  it ourselves or in Haiti, how we turn, we fixed the water supply.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:25:24):**  We know how it works.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:25:26):**  It's our project.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:25:27):**  Yes.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:25:28):**  It seems like it starts exactly from what you're talking about of not having an understanding.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:25:32):**  Everybody bothered to get in there first and ask the locals what their challenges are and  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:25:37):**  what they see as the difficulties or the problems that they are facing.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:25:42):**  Yes.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:25:43):**  So like in Haiti, if you go in and they say, what are the most important, what are your  
**[0:25:47-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:25:47):**  vision for this community that has a lot of challenges?  
**[0:25:48-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:25:48):**  And they say, well, we want to have clean water with this.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:25:52):**  Then say, how can you help solve this?  
**[0:25:56-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:25:56):**  Well, we get a lot of money from someone.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:25:59):**  No, no.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:26:00):**  How can you help solve this?  
**[0:26:01-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:26:01):**  We might be able to find research.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:26:02):**  We might want to do this.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:26:03):**  Well, we have volunteers.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:26:05):**  We could dig these, put this pipe in and we can do this.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:26:09):**  In Bulgaria, a friend of mine was working.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:26:11):**  They lost nearly all the water was seeping into the ground right after the communists  
**[0:26:16-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:26:16):**  left.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:26:17):**  And they got the citizens to put on ear hearing devices.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:26:25):**  And they were going up and down the streets, fighting the leaks so they could fix them.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:26:29):**  The citizens going up and down the streets.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:26:31):**  And I tell you, when the citizens go up and down the streets and they find the leak and  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:26:35):**  they fix it, that citizen is now part of that community, saving their own community.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:26:40):**  There's a difference.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:26:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:26:42):**  There's an ownership in that, that you can't supplant from outside.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:26:46):**  That's right.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:26:47):**  It's not an expert driven system anymore.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:26:49):**  It's everyone working together.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:26:51):**  That makes so much sense.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:26:52):**  And in chapter nine, you write about embracing feedback.  
**[0:26:57-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:26:57):**  And I think this ties right in.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:26:59):**  You talk about monitoring and the feedback using nature as a guide.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:27:03):**  Now from what we've been talking about, that feedback is listening to the answers that  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:27:08):**  come from these open-ended questions and identifying what people see as their own challenges rather  
**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:27:13):**  than supplanting them from outside.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:27:16):**  But monitoring using nature as a guide, how does that work in the context of communities?  
**[0:27:22-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:27:22):**  Well, if you look at nature, ecological systems, they have dynamic feedback loops do very well.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:27:29):**  And once they have very slow feedback loops, crash and burn.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:27:34):**  So the whole idea of setting up systems with their dynamic feedback loops, you can make  
**[0:27:39-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:27:39):**  corrections that aren't costly.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:27:43):**  For example, in the United States and through parts of the world, we had kind of this global  
**[0:27:47-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:27:47):**  urban renewal when we invented reinforced concrete in 1960s, 1970s.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:27:53):**  We built horrible buildings in Eastern Europe, in the United States, we have urban renewal,  
**[0:27:57-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:27:57):**  and there was no feedback loops.  
**[0:27:58-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:27:58):**  It was top-down.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:27:59):**  And most of those places, they call that architecture brutalism.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:28:04):**  Brutalism, yeah.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:28:06):**  Most of that is being torn down now, but it wasn't done with any feedback loops.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:28:14):**  It was done with top-down in Eastern European, communist countries, capitalist countries  
**[0:28:21-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:28:21):**  with federal government.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:28:23):**  And so there's no feedback loops.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:28:24):**  So I think if you come up with systems where you constantly have feedback loops, you check  
**[0:28:28-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:28:28):**  in all the time.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:28:30):**  I know communities who do things, every year they have a celebration, they check in what  
**[0:28:34-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:28:34):**  worked, what didn't work, and make changes.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:28:36):**  And that's how nature works.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:28:38):**  And we try to get rid of, when we disconnect how nature works and try to just do it expert-driven,  
**[0:28:45-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:28:45):**  this guy seems to know what he's doing, we'll just follow him until we go off the cliff.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:28:51):**  And this is not popular with those who like expert-driven society.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:28:58):**  And I'm not even going to Russia, I'm not talking about American cities, certain governments,  
**[0:29:04-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:29:04):**  they don't like that.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:29:05):**  Yeah, that sounds like quite a challenge.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:29:08):**  And it actually ties into some things that we're working with in the company that I'm  
**[0:29:12-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:29:12):**  also collaborating with at the moment, Climate Farmers.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:29:15):**  We're a new startup, and one of the things that we're really focused on at the moment  
**[0:29:19-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:29:19):**  is shortening the feedback loops, both within the organization and with the farmers that  
**[0:29:25-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:29:25):**  we work with directly, in order to have a quicker understanding and a turnaround of  
**[0:29:31-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:29:31):**  the products that we're building, and making sure that they're effective before we build  
**[0:29:35-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:29:35):**  out large things that we later find out are actually not effective or not what people  
**[0:29:40-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:29:40):**  wanted in the first place.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:29:42):**  Exactly.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:29:43):**  And so it's much more effective and it's more inclusive too.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:29:48):**  And so it ties into what we had just been talking about in including as many voices  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:29:52):**  as possible and asking the right questions, are those two aspects that are essential for  
**[0:29:57-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:29:57):**  these feedback loops you're talking about?  
**[0:29:59-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:29:59):**  And listen.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:30:00):**  You can ask the right questions, but if you don't listen to what they're saying, if you  
**[0:30:05-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:30:05):**  know what I mean.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:30:06):**  Yes, absolutely.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:30:08):**  And so listening is one thing, it's taking in information, but there's deeper listening.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:30:12):**  And I'm sure you could say a lot about the different levels of listening that we're striving  
**[0:30:16-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:30:16):**  for here.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:30:17):**  That's right.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:30:18):**  And besides asking some of the right questions that aren't loaded, the last question should  
**[0:30:22-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:30:22):**  always be, what did I not ask that I should have heard?  
**[0:30:27-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:30:27):**  What if some of the things come out about that that you've heard as responses?  
**[0:30:34-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:30:34):**  Well, they may talk about part of the systems that you're not aware of.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:30:44):**  You know what I mean?  
**[0:30:45-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:30:45):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:30:46):**  And so it may be, oh, I'm trying to think of some good examples.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:30:53):**  Our assumptions are just, you know what I mean.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:30:58):**  It might impact them the way that you never thought of.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:31:03):**  Nothing comes to mind right away, but it's always like, oh, okay.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:31:09):**  That's interesting.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:31:10):**  I'm sure it's different each time, right?  
**[0:31:12-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:31:12):**  Almost by definition, it can't be anticipated.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:31:15):**  No, it can't be anticipated.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:31:17):**  So that's a good last question to ask.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:31:20):**  And it also, people sometimes want to tell you what they think you want to hear.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:31:27):**  So you also have to do systems, for example, where they have some autonomy because people  
**[0:31:34-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:31:34):**  are afraid.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:31:35):**  So when I had say ministry working on some issues, I'd have those who are local government  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:31:43):**  or citizens at universities in a separate group so they could actually speak because  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:31:48):**  some will not speak with the other people in the room.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:31:53):**  And then I've had situations where I was looking at government, I had a town, a city planner  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:31:59):**  who used information against people who were powerless.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:32:04):**  So I had to fire him, things like that.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:32:07):**  So there are those people you have to get rid of.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:32:10):**  Yeah, that must be a difficult thing to identify and then make a decision on.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:32:14):**  Is that also something that you try and make as a decision with the community?  
**[0:32:18-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:32:18):**  Oh, I don't make decisions.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:32:20):**  Well, yes, I brought in an external person to do all the interviews of all the people  
**[0:32:25-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:32:25):**  anonymously.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:32:27):**  So I could get the information clearly.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:32:29):**  I assume that what I hear and know is limited and you have to get better information.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:32:35):**  I mean, just because I have too many academic degrees, I feel like people are always showing  
**[0:32:40-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:32:40):**  up with their thinking.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:32:41):**  So you have to get away from that.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:32:42):**  You've got to get it from other sources.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:32:44):**  Well, so in dealing with conflicts like that, and I guess it lets me to jump ahead all the  
**[0:32:50-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:32:50):**  way to that last principle, which is resolving conflict, right?  
**[0:32:53-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:32:53):**  The first aspect of which is conflict prevention.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:32:56):**  Now, I've both witnessed and been directly involved with projects that have failed and  
**[0:33:01-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:33:01):**  communities that have broken down because of conflict.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:33:04):**  And I've spent a lot of time thinking about what could have been done to prevent these  
**[0:33:07-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:33:07):**  failures in communication and what some of the most important aspects of conflict resolution  
**[0:33:13-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:33:13):**  need to be learned.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:33:15):**  You've got great case studies from the book here.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:33:17):**  What are some of your primary learnings from observing these different communities and  
**[0:33:23-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:33:23):**  projects?  
**[0:33:24-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:33:24):**  Well, what's most interesting is the project, they rather look at problems.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:33:28):**  I looked at successful communities and that was defined as things that were, had social  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:33:33):**  vitality that includes issues of equity and social justice and so forth.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:33:38):**  It had some support for building everyone's livelihoods and looked at the ecological natural  
**[0:33:43-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:33:43):**  resources and communities are doing all those things and making progress.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:33:49):**  What's interesting is how few conflicts they identified they had.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:33:55):**  Like in Xlentes Juarez, Mexico, a community that was at the time up to 1980s, the 1980s  
**[0:34:03-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:34:03):**  national government was clear cutting their forest and taking the money for a few powerful  
**[0:34:06-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:34:06):**  people and they basically had a revolution thrown out and they stopped cutting.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:34:10):**  They only cut a few trees for furniture making, they made furniture and ecological land conservation  
**[0:34:16-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:34:16):**  for tourism and they developed some common norms, positive norms together.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:34:24):**  And that's one example where I talked about conflicts and I talked to not just the boss  
**[0:34:29-0:34:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:34:29):**  but workers and you know, we actually don't have a lot of discrete types, we don't have  
**[0:34:34-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:34:34):**  a lot, we actually have common values that we're working together with now.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:34:41):**  And so I was actually surprised with how few conflicts, because I've seen a lot of conflicts  
**[0:34:46-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:34:46):**  and groups, how few conflicts the ones that were doing well had because they had some  
**[0:34:50-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:34:50):**  common norms.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:34:52):**  And norms come to the word just normal, what's normal?  
**[0:34:57-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:34:57):**  And so it had common norms that were positive, that they understood from each other how we  
**[0:35:01-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:35:01):**  had to do things, we have to learn more about this, we need to do this, we agree, we talk  
**[0:35:04-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:35:04):**  about this.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:35:06):**  And so I think the way to reduce conflict is actually build positive norms at the beginning  
**[0:35:11-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:35:11):**  as part of the process.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:35:14):**  And then yes, you have conflicts and have a system to recognize them and work them out,  
**[0:35:20-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:35:20):**  not deny them.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:35:23):**  Well, it seems these common norms that you've listed are fairly inherent to all of the communities  
**[0:35:29-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:35:29):**  are observed, and essentially are inherent in people.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:35:34):**  We all have similar priorities and visions for what we want as far as like health and  
**[0:35:40-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:35:40):**  well being for our families and ourselves.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:35:43):**  What is the difference between the communities that have communicated these well or establish  
**[0:35:48-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:35:48):**  them as norms and the ones that are still struggling with a lot of conflict within their  
**[0:35:55-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:35:55):**  organizations?  
**[0:35:56-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:35:56):**  Well, everyone has different, your boundaries, some people, their boundaries, how they work  
**[0:36:03-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:36:03):**  stops at the family front door.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:36:06):**  Some goes to their immediate neighborhood, some goes to the town or this region or the  
**[0:36:12-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:36:12):**  country or the world, you see what I mean?  
**[0:36:15-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:36:15):**  So everyone has different boundaries, and that's some of the conflicts, because people  
**[0:36:18-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:36:18):**  are very, very willing to do things within their boundary, but outside, I don't care.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:36:24):**  So opening the boundaries so they see the whole system, like climate change has no boundaries.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:36:29):**  Well, the Earth doesn't affect Mars at all.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:36:33):**  But so I think trying to change the boundaries.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:36:37):**  My observation is when people are feeling like, when you bring people together, start  
**[0:36:41-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:36:41):**  working on issues, their boundaries grow, and therefore, there's not a conflict on whether  
**[0:36:47-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:36:47):**  or not they submit towns or the community supports the social service agency with some  
**[0:36:51-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:36:51):**  of their taxpayer money, because their boundary grew and this is important.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:36:57):**  People that boundaries, when people go beyond their boundaries, they have fear.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:37:03):**  They don't know it.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:37:04):**  They don't anger, so that fear, fear feeds the anger, you know what I mean?  
**[0:37:08-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:37:08):**  My taxpayer money is paying for this other side of town, I don't care about that side  
**[0:37:11-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:37:11):**  of town, you see what I mean?  
**[0:37:13-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:37:13):**  And so it's trying to grow the boundaries.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:37:14):**  I think it's important to reduce the fear, which feeds the anger and build positive relationships  
**[0:37:21-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:37:21):**  that people desire, but they don't know we know that until they get them.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:37:26):**  Sure.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:37:27):**  And that seems also important to reducing these narrow identities that we box ourselves  
**[0:37:32-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:37:32):**  into, right?  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:37:33):**  If we see ourselves as part of a grander community, rather than just our immediate area or our  
**[0:37:38-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:37:38):**  single family, or whatever other demographics we might define ourselves by, we're probably  
**[0:37:43-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:37:43):**  going to look more favorably on the effects and the collaborations with other people outside  
**[0:37:47-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:37:47):**  of this narrow area that we had otherwise considered.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:37:51):**  And people who are difficult sometimes need some positive relationships.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:37:57):**  They don't know it, but they need it.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:38:02):**  And a great story of a very wise person who died many years ago.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:38:05):**  There was a march against nuclear growth in the United States, and a nasty guy on the  
**[0:38:11-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:38:11):**  side of the sidewalk yelled at them.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:38:13):**  And so the following day, the 85 year old guy went back to and talk to him.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:38:17):**  I see this guy here.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:38:19):**  And I try to build a relationship with him because he saw everything is, you know, how  
**[0:38:23-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:38:23):**  can you be against reducing nuclear weapons?  
**[0:38:25-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:38:25):**  But anyway, so, so we saw him and he's just sitting outside of the folding aluminum chair.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:38:30):**  He said,  
**[0:38:31-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:38:31):**  you know, the chair looked pretty comfortable, so that's a nice aluminum folding chair you're  
**[0:38:37-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:38:37):**  sitting in.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:38:38):**  Do you like it?  
**[0:38:39-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:38:39):**  Yes, I like this aluminum folding chair.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:38:42):**  And trying to build some relationships, some connections, honest, but some connections.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:38:47):**  And after about an hour, they build a relationship.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:38:49):**  And he was understanding, yeah, maybe this is worth, you know, but trying to feel, find  
**[0:38:54-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:38:54):**  something in common, build something.  
**[0:38:57-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:38:57):**  And I go back to the issue of vision.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:38:59):**  People have a vision or different visions, but there's certain parts of visions that  
**[0:39:02-0:39:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:39:02):**  people share.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:39:03):**  They want air to breathe.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:39:04):**  They want water, they could drink, they won't say it.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:39:07):**  They want these things.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:39:09):**  And that pushes them beyond their immediate boundary.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:39:13):**  So I think the vision itself is really a common vision is like core to moving ahead.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:39:18):**  And then in the book, I put up a dozen steps that you could go through to get to some actions.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:39:25):**  But I think you have to find some commonality and grow on that.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:39:30):**  That's my, I guess that's my bottom line, how I see things.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:39:33):**  Yeah, that's very solid advice.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:39:35):**  And I'm sure that works for a very wide range of things.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:39:38):**  Now like you were talking about in those practical steps there in the final chapter, you present  
**[0:39:43-0:39:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:39:43):**  a toolbox of leadership strategies that are meant to guide newcomers.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:39:46):**  Can you give me an overview of some of the do's and don'ts of planning, organizing, and  
**[0:39:51-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:39:51):**  facilitating community building processes?  
**[0:39:54-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:39:54):**  Yes.  
**[0:39:55-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:39:55):**  So I talk about what I call adaptive leadership.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:39:58):**  And I took a course in 1984 from Ron Heifetz at the Kennedy School.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:40:03):**  He's a psychiatrist, leadership to us, mid-career public administrators.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:40:09):**  And leadership, how I see it is getting, adaptive leadership is getting people not to look at  
**[0:40:18-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:40:18):**  the problems they're avoiding.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:40:20):**  It's like therapy.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:40:21):**  People go to therapy because they're avoiding things, mostly.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:40:25):**  My bad experience, whatever it is.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:40:28):**  So the big first challenge is to get people to look at things they're avoiding.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:40:32):**  Not easy and not get, not be the messenger that gets killed off in the process.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:40:38):**  People don't want to see things, right?  
**[0:40:40-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:40:40):**  Then the second step is to get people to take responsibility for them and do their work  
**[0:40:46-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:40:46):**  to fix it.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:40:48):**  So if you look at leadership in that approach is getting people to face things that are  
**[0:40:52-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:40:52):**  avoiding and helping them do their work.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:40:57):**  And then if you're really successful, this is some great leaders in Romania I talked  
**[0:41:00-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:41:00):**  to, their definition was we are successful at leadership if they don't need us anymore.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:41:08):**  So the goal then is to get yourself out of the picture.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:41:10):**  So when the group says, look what we did, and you're out of the way, you've done your  
**[0:41:14-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:41:14):**  job.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:41:17):**  And many of the leaders, they want to say, look at my name on the plaque for the new  
**[0:41:21-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:41:21):**  blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:41:23):**  So the goal is to make yourself invisible, but get them to look at the issues they're  
**[0:41:28-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:41:28):**  avoiding and then do their work and support them, get them, help them with resources,  
**[0:41:32-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:41:32):**  whatever logistics, but get out of the way.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:41:36):**  That must be difficult because a lot of the people who are attracted to leadership in  
**[0:41:39-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:41:39):**  the beginning are doing so as to scratch an itch for their ego.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:41:44):**  And it seems like the only way to be effective at this is to remove the ego from the equation.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:41:49):**  Right.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:41:50):**  That is the challenge.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:41:51):**  There's an old expression that says it's amazing what we could get accomplished if everyone  
**[0:41:55-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:41:55):**  doesn't need credit for everything.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:41:56):**  It's a good way of putting it.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:42:00):**  Okay.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:42:01):**  And that I think is a true sign of an effective leader.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:42:05):**  And can you recommend some techniques or maybe some activities that you can start to work  
**[0:42:09-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:42:09):**  on to look at this as a maybe benevolent leadership process, one that doesn't necessarily include  
**[0:42:16-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:42:16):**  the credit that you need, are taking your ego out of this in order to be able to move  
**[0:42:21-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:42:21):**  forward and get more people involved and take ownership?  
**[0:42:26-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:42:26):**  Well, I think you would probably agree that if you're involved in something and your input  
**[0:42:31-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:42:31):**  mattered, you're more interested in staying involved.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:42:34):**  Am I right?  
**[0:42:35-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:42:35):**  Yes.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:42:36):**  Definitely.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:42:37):**  And if you're involved in something and your input didn't matter, you're out of there.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:42:40):**  Right.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:42:41):**  Why?  
**[0:42:42-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:42:42):**  Why?  
**[0:42:43-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:42:43):**  You know, I'm not needed.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:42:44):**  So the question is how to get people input, get them involved and be needed in a way so  
**[0:42:51-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:42:51):**  that they say, okay, I actually contributed.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:42:55):**  Right.  
**[0:42:56-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:42:56):**  Definitely.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:42:57):**  So when we opened, when we opened the recycling center in Little Town in Vermont, 10,000 people,  
**[0:43:06-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:43:06):**  we had a thousand people show up on Saturday morning with snow blowing outside because  
**[0:43:10-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:43:10):**  we had the kids in all the schools do some of the recycling signage and artwork.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:43:15):**  And we had, we had the color guard march in, celebrate that this is a patriotic thing.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:43:21):**  And we had lots of citizens.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:43:22):**  So by getting everyone involved, a thousand people own that new recycling center.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:43:28):**  They all played a part from the, from the local business people who started recycling.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:43:32):**  We supported it from the teachers and the students, from parents.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:43:37):**  So get people involved and let them be part of the solution.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:43:46):**  And so moving into, I guess, other parts of the leadership role after you've got people  
**[0:43:52-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:43:52):**  taking ownership and feeling like this is theirs, that they have a say in it, what are  
**[0:43:57-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:43:57):**  some of the other do's and don'ts of moving forward?  
**[0:43:59-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:43:59):**  Well, you need some systems in place that people agree upon because you can, no one  
**[0:44:04-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:44:04):**  wants to go to a thousand committee meetings.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:44:06):**  So you need to get systems in place and a work plan.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:44:10):**  And so now it gets basically, okay, you have a vision.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:44:14):**  You look at the barriers that you have to deal with to get there.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:44:17):**  You look at the resources, the deal, get over those barriers.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:44:20):**  It might be an agency, it may be funding, whatever it is.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:44:23):**  You look at those, you look at people who want to work on these different elements of  
**[0:44:26-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:44:26):**  the overall vision and they come together.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:44:31):**  And as a group, it's like a beehive.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:44:34):**  They stay alive all winter because they cluster and they take turns who's going to generate  
**[0:44:38-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:44:38):**  the heat as they slowly eat their honey.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:44:42):**  And that again, the ecological model of feedback.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:44:46):**  So if everyone's doing a part of the vision, okay, and maybe one person part of the vision  
**[0:44:52-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:44:52):**  is that big, but they're really interested in this and they find two other people to  
**[0:44:55-0:44:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:44:55):**  work with and they get progress on that.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:44:59):**  Okay.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:45:00):**  Then they say, well, I'm part of this.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:45:03):**  I have solved the problems.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:45:06):**  And you put it together, you actually have something.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:45:12):**  It's somewhat threatening to leaders who I'm now the mayor and I know all the best do.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:45:18):**  But one of the colleagues I worked with gave the book, like reviewed the book and he immediately  
**[0:45:25-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:45:25):**  gave a copy to his mayor.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:45:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:45:29):**  So I would say is that you get everyone involved in parts of getting to where the group as  
**[0:45:35-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:45:35):**  a whole wants to go, doing pieces.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:45:38):**  And you need a system in place, feedback loops, maybe four or five working groups, liaisons  
**[0:45:45-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:45:45):**  that check in every monthly, you know, and then you get together and celebrate once a  
**[0:45:51-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:45:51):**  year.  
**[0:45:52-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:45:52):**  And my favorite celebration system was to have a competition for the bake-off.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:46:01):**  People bring their favorite desserts in, they all get a number, no one who brings them in,  
**[0:46:06-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:46:06):**  and cut them into pieces and everyone gets five dots.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:46:09):**  And whoever gets the most number dots get a $50 bill at the end of recognition.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:46:14):**  And everyone has a dessert and everyone eats so much sugar that the energy.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:46:21):**  So one person at a public meeting says, this is the best public meeting I have ever gone  
**[0:46:25-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:46:25):**  to.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:46:26):**  And no one leaves early.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:46:29):**  See, these types of tangible examples I think we need more of because though the principles  
**[0:46:36-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:46:36):**  and the concepts in the book make perfect sense, people might still be looking, people  
**[0:46:40-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:46:40):**  myself, might still be looking for little activities that can get the ball rolling and  
**[0:46:46-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:46:46):**  can start these conversations and these connections.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:46:48):**  Do you have more like that?  
**[0:46:50-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:46:50):**  No, I actually, I think I put that in the book so I said, you can tell, yes.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:46:52):**  If you read the book, I have lots of short stories.  
**[0:46:55-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:46:55):**  There's 26 case studies, but I think I have about another 50 short stories of what people  
**[0:46:59-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:46:59):**  did that turned it around.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:47:00):**  For example, we tried to pass a bond for five counts to improve our school system.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:47:07):**  We had single pane glass for New Hampshire, the boilers were old, roofs leaked, and every  
**[0:47:13-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:47:13):**  year the bond got voted down.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:47:16):**  So finally someone said, we are going to build the agricultural extension off the school  
**[0:47:20-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:47:20):**  ourselves.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:47:21):**  So a bunch of people came together, took about six months, so plan it, and donated supplies.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:47:27):**  And we built in one weekend, a new greenhouse, a classroom for the egg school.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:47:32):**  And right on the building, we had hundreds of people from the five towns come together  
**[0:47:37-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:47:37):**  to do this.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:47:39):**  And at the end of the weekend says, look, we did it ourselves.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:47:43):**  Those hundreds of people were all now part of the school system.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:47:47):**  The following year, they appointed representatives from the town, a worker, not consultants,  
**[0:47:54-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:47:54):**  but actual like local people who were having to be retired engineer or the heating system  
**[0:47:59-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:47:59):**  person.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:48:00):**  And they looked at all the schools and they made a recommendation.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:48:02):**  We need money for these 17 things.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:48:04):**  Okay.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:48:05):**  They went to the voters, it passed.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:48:08):**  Because everybody was now part of the school system.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:48:12):**  By putting some nails into the greenhouse or, you know, signing.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:48:18):**  That makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:48:19):**  Once you're participating in it, once you've taken a role, it's yours, at least a part  
**[0:48:23-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:48:23):**  of it.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:48:24):**  And you're going to be that much more invested in the outcome.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:48:27):**  You talk to neighbors, do you know who they were?  
**[0:48:29-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:48:29):**  The other town over?  
**[0:48:30-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:48:30):**  It's not the bad town, it's the other town, you know?  
**[0:48:33-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:48:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:48:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:48:35):**  So things like that.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:48:36):**  It's constantly bringing people together.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:48:37):**  Someone once introduced me as a serial collaborator.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:48:40):**  That's high praise.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:48:45):**  That's a really good title.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:48:46):**  I love that.  
**[0:48:47-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:48:47):**  That's pretty bad.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:48:48):**  He was the president of the college.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:48:50):**  Anyway, so I truly believe in that and then get out of the way.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:48:56):**  Now getting these things started still requires a certain amount of individual responsibility  
**[0:49:01-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:49:01):**  and people to take some initiative to do some of the organizing or sometimes physical work  
**[0:49:08-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:49:08):**  that it takes to get them off the ground.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:49:10):**  And I've been a part of these discussions when we're starting community projects where  
**[0:49:14-0:49:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:49:14):**  everybody is on board with the idea, but nobody either has the time or is willing to take  
**[0:49:19-0:49:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:49:19):**  the step to actually do some of the work required to move it forward.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:49:21):**  How do you get past that barrier?  
**[0:49:23-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:49:23):**  Does it require some delegation?  
**[0:49:25-0:49:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:49:25):**  Well, there's usually groups.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:49:28):**  There are always groups in organization, in towns.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:49:30):**  For example, let's say a town.  
**[0:49:32-0:49:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:49:32):**  They want to do the next master plan for the next 10 years of what we're going to go.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:49:37):**  First there's a few people in the town, but that's not enough people.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:49:39):**  There's a planning office, something.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:49:41):**  There's often a number of NGOs.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:49:44):**  There may be social NGOs that work with low income people.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:49:48):**  There might be environment NGOs.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:49:49):**  So you get the infrastructure.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:49:51):**  Don't replace the infrastructure, social infrastructure, bring them together.  
**[0:49:55-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:49:55):**  A lot of people, their egos, we just do it ourselves.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:49:58):**  No, the goal is all this social infrastructure is there in pieces.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:50:04):**  Your job is to bring them together and you'd be amazed if you just look at your community,  
**[0:50:08-0:50:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:50:08):**  what groups are caring about these things, bring them together and say, we want an initiative  
**[0:50:12-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:50:12):**  to help say, build it, start our own local community foundation for the town.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:50:17):**  Here's what we do.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:50:19):**  And if these five groups get together, we have enough capacity to bring people together  
**[0:50:23-0:50:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:50:23):**  and do this and set this up, create this community foundation that would support all of us in  
**[0:50:28-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:50:28):**  some way.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:50:29):**  And then we get, we're done.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:50:32):**  People do not want to get involved where they can never check out.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:50:36):**  I mean, how many times you've been invited to be on a group and without any into it.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:50:42):**  Right.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:50:43):**  Right.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:50:44):**  You feel like you're getting roped into something.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:50:45):**  Exactly.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:50:46):**  You never get out.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:50:47):**  So you say, this is a three month project.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:50:48):**  Do this or six months.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:50:49):**  Can you do these things?  
**[0:50:51-0:50:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:50:51):**  And they say, okay, I guess at the beginning of the end, it makes sense.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:50:54):**  It fits our mission of our organization.  
**[0:50:56-0:50:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:50:56):**  It cuts our project community.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:50:58):**  And so a lot of the work we do here, this area is, I run a nonprofit, a historic mill  
**[0:51:05-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:51:05):**  innovation, and one of our teams is called partnerships.  
**[0:51:08-0:51:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:51:08):**  And all they're doing is how we can work with other groups and share our resources and work  
**[0:51:12-0:51:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:51:12):**  together.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:51:15):**  And it's amazing the resources when people that are already in your community.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:51:22):**  Now, also, this is an important thing, I think.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:51:26):**  Please go ahead.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:51:27):**  When you bring these people together, these groups, you're building trust and it's more  
**[0:51:34-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:51:34):**  difficult for the divisive, angry people to divide the community.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:51:40):**  And right now, would you see this happening everywhere in the United States and other  
**[0:51:44-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:51:44):**  places, those who are get power by dividing and then they can control and anger and like  
**[0:51:51-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:51:51):**  they're more totalitarian type leaders.  
**[0:51:55-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:51:55):**  It actually builds a base that's more difficult for them to divide.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:51:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:52:00):**  Yeah, that's really important and you bring up an excellent point about how easy it is  
**[0:52:06-0:52:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:52:06):**  for people to come together over a shared enemy, I think is another way of saying what  
**[0:52:10-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:52:10):**  you just mentioned.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:52:12):**  And it seems like it's difficult to find these other commonalities that can supersede this  
**[0:52:18-0:52:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:52:18):**  antagonistic energy of bringing people together in order to fight something external or to  
**[0:52:23-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:52:23):**  overcome something that is plaguing them.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:52:26):**  But there have to be better ways to bring people together to accomplish something positive  
**[0:52:32-0:52:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:52:32):**  rather than just fight against something that they're against.  
**[0:52:36-0:52:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:52:36):**  Have you found these other motivators that are more powerful than that?  
**[0:52:40-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:52:40):**  Well, I think people are very motivated with their surroundings.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:52:44):**  For example, we have a lake in our town.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:52:48):**  We have a year long program called Celebrate Water, which looks at protecting the water  
**[0:52:53-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:52:53):**  and our water resources.  
**[0:52:55-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:52:55):**  And so we're having a whole effort around this large lake where people have been in  
**[0:52:58-0:53:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:52:58):**  conflict over the years, where they all share some commonality.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:53:03):**  They want to protect the lake water.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:53:07):**  But what does that mean for the chemicals they put on their lawn that feed into the  
**[0:53:11-0:53:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:53:11):**  lake or what?  
**[0:53:12-0:53:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:53:12):**  You know what I mean?  
**[0:53:13-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:53:13):**  So you look at things people really care about.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:53:15):**  So water bodies, their schools, their kids, safety of the kids.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:53:23):**  There's lots of things they share.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:53:28):**  And they'll fight about every specific little policy change about those issues.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:53:34):**  But you need to back up and look at the system.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:53:39):**  And then yes, there are barriers, you have to find those, but you got to find the commonalities  
**[0:53:43-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:53:43):**  first.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:53:44):**  So I think they're in a local area, they're ecological systems, they have where they live,  
**[0:53:49-0:53:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:53:49):**  the air.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:53:50):**  I grew up in LA, I know the air.  
**[0:53:54-0:54:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:53:54):**  But here's water and other issues, schools and parks, open spaces.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:54:00):**  Or like the guy said at that meeting, 10 acres within 10 minutes.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:54:04):**  We live in New Hampshire, we should have access to some open space.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:54:10):**  And how to do that.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:54:11):**  And then the groups come out.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:54:13):**  There are conservation groups, social groups, local business groups, because that affects  
**[0:54:18-0:54:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:54:18):**  the businesses, the communities, the quality of the environment, the schools.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:54:22):**  So I think it's always trying to find the commonality that they have sharing common  
**[0:54:29-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:54:29):**  rather than what they're angry against.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:54:34):**  That could go in the wrong direction really bad.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:54:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:39-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:54:39):**  But the Ukrainians, they want to maintain the country that they feel they could.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:54:45):**  They know what it's like being under communist regime, Russian communist regime.  
**[0:54:50-0:54:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:54:50):**  They want a country that they can actually be free, make decisions.  
**[0:54:55-0:54:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:54:55):**  That's driving them, right?  
**[0:54:58-0:55:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:54:58):**  They're angry at the Russians, but what's driving them is what they want for their future.  
**[0:55:03-0:55:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:55:03):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:55:06):**  That self determination is a powerful motivator.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:55:10):**  They're very much and it's a horrible situation.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:55:15):**  But that's what's driving them, right?  
**[0:55:17-0:55:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:55:17):**  It's not just anger the Russians, it's what they want their future to be.  
**[0:55:21-0:55:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:55:21):**  Yeah, and I think bringing the conversation to the connection with that vision or hope  
**[0:55:28-0:55:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:55:28):**  for something better, rather than just diminishing or overcoming the negative aspects or the  
**[0:55:34-0:55:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:55:34):**  antagonist of the moment is what is going to prevail in the long run.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:55:38):**  That's right.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:55:39):**  All they would do is put another dictator to charge.  
**[0:55:42-0:55:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:55:42):**  Right.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:55:43):**  That's that happened in South America a lot.  
**[0:55:44-0:55:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:55:44):**  You see it from African countries.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:55:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:55:47-0:55:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:55:47):**  And so Mandela and those people thought about their future, not just getting this bad guy  
**[0:55:53-0:55:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:55:53):**  here.  
**[0:55:54-0:55:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:55:54):**  Right.  
**[0:55:55-0:55:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:55:55):**  Three framing.  
**[0:55:57-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:55:57):**  It's surprising how often that's missing in these overthrow of government scenarios.  
**[0:56:01-0:56:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:56:01):**  Right.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:56:02):**  It's we need to get rid of this person or this regime, but there isn't much of an agreement  
**[0:56:06-0:56:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:56:06):**  about what needs to come and replace it.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:56:10):**  And I'm sure there are micro versions of that, not just at state levels.  
**[0:56:13-0:56:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:56:13):**  Right.  
**[0:56:14-0:56:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:56:14):**  And that's really important.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:56:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:56:16-0:56:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:56:16):**  And local levels to all levels, what we went for a community.  
**[0:56:19-0:56:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:56:19):**  So we had a big thing in our community about electing our new board, town council, big  
**[0:56:25-0:56:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:56:25):**  debates, right?  
**[0:56:26-0:56:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:56:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:56:27-0:56:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:56:27):**  Same thing.  
**[0:56:28-0:56:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:56:28):**  Right.  
**[0:56:29-0:56:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:56:29):**  So, yes, I'm hoping that the 12 principles is not, they aren't my principles, by the  
**[0:56:35-0:56:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:56:35):**  way, they're just what people said, I'm putting together in big boxes, right.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:56:40):**  And then I asked them how they did these things.  
**[0:56:42-0:56:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:56:42):**  And I got there.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:56:43):**  And so I wanted to give practical tools to how they do these things.  
**[0:56:47-0:56:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:56:47):**  But I take no ownership of this is what you need to do.  
**[0:56:51-0:56:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:56:51):**  That's what people said.  
**[0:56:54-0:56:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:56:54):**  I think we're doing really excellent jobs.  
**[0:56:56-0:56:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:56:56):**  So I think that's the important thing.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:56:59):**  For sure.  
**[0:57:00-0:57:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:57:00):**  For sure.  
**[0:57:01-0:57:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:57:01):**  Now I'm going to throw a scenario at you, which is very dear to my heart, which is the  
**[0:57:04-0:57:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:57:04):**  scenario that I'm in.  
**[0:57:06-0:57:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:57:06):**  I'm getting ready to move to a small farm in a community in the center of Catalunya,  
**[0:57:12-0:57:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:57:12):**  which is well known for being proud of its culture and its heritage and its language,  
**[0:57:19-0:57:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:57:19):**  which I do not yet speak, I can communicate with people perfectly well in Spanish.  
**[0:57:23-0:57:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:57:23):**  But if anybody has any knowledge of recent history in Catalunya and the independence  
**[0:57:29-0:57:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:57:29):**  efforts, this is the area of the province where a lot of that is the strongest, this  
**[0:57:36-0:57:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:57:36):**  independence fervor.  
**[0:57:38-0:57:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:57:38):**  And we're working to well, integrate into this small community and do some ecological  
**[0:57:46-0:57:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:57:46):**  projects, especially with the farm that we'll have, and also hope to grow it into the surrounding  
**[0:57:52-0:57:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:57:52):**  community and maybe even into the county and do some work at a larger level beyond just  
**[0:57:57-0:57:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:57:57):**  our own land.  
**[0:57:58-0:58:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:57:58):**  Now I'm looking for ways to, I guess, integrate into the community.  
**[0:58:04-0:58:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:58:04):**  I'm working on learning the language and I know that's a key one from many other places  
**[0:58:10-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:58:10):**  that I've lived.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:58:11):**  That's a good first step.  
**[0:58:13-0:58:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:58:13):**  But also starting to ask the questions and to create the space and the environment for  
**[0:58:20-0:58:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:58:20):**  people to start to share their ideas.  
**[0:58:22-0:58:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:58:22):**  This is not a particularly connected community.  
**[0:58:24-0:58:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:58:24):**  It doesn't have like a center and it's a very small population of people who mostly live  
**[0:58:29-0:58:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:58:29):**  there only seasonally because there's a lot of vacation properties in the area.  
**[0:58:33-0:58:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:58:33):**  And so trying to create an identity within this town that is somewhat fractured, but  
**[0:58:40-0:58:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:58:40):**  not from any deep-seated resentment or like you might find elsewhere.  
**[0:58:45-0:58:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:58:45):**  What are some ideas that you might have for ways that I can start to accomplish what I  
**[0:58:50-0:58:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:58:50):**  just laid out?  
**[0:58:51-0:59:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:58:51):**  Well, I think one way is an invitation to come to visit your farm, offer something to  
**[0:59:08-0:59:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:59:08):**  the visitors.  
**[0:59:09-0:59:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:59:09):**  You could have like a formal gathering.  
**[0:59:11-0:59:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:59:11):**  Not like you're trying to sell your products, but offer a place where the people would come  
**[0:59:19-0:59:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:59:19):**  together and maybe like in this town here, when I did a visioning for our town of Alstead,  
**[0:59:27-0:59:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:59:27):**  I asked them what was most important about our community that we really wanted to value.  
**[0:59:31-0:59:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:59:31):**  And they said the potlucks.  
**[0:59:33-0:59:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:59:33):**  That was one of the first ideas I had right away.  
**[0:59:40-0:59:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:59:40):**  This is an environment conservation program.  
**[0:59:42-0:59:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:59:42):**  We put a lot of land and conservation around the lake from this process, but they started  
**[0:59:46-0:59:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:59:46):**  with the potlucks.  
**[0:59:47-0:59:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:59:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:59:48-0:59:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:59:48):**  Okay.  
**[0:59:49-0:59:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:59:49):**  A place they could gather.  
**[0:59:50-0:59:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:59:50):**  There's a place in the town now that has a big timber frame shelter and a mud oven that  
**[0:59:57-1:00:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=0:59:57):**  makes pizzas.  
**[1:00:00-1:00:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:00:00):**  And every week now, they say they sell bread.  
**[1:00:02-1:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:00:02):**  It's a wonderful bakery, but every Wednesday they make pizzas for a fundraiser for a local  
**[1:00:10-1:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:00:10):**  community group.  
**[1:00:13-1:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:00:13):**  So all the profits every Wednesday, that pizza night, people are welcome to come down.  
**[1:00:16-1:00:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:00:16):**  They pay a few bucks for a pizza.  
**[1:00:19-1:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:00:19):**  They make, they give help, set them up, but they want to put on it.  
**[1:00:22-1:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:00:22):**  And all the profits go to a group.  
**[1:00:26-1:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:00:26):**  They rotate different groups throughout the summer.  
**[1:00:28-1:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:00:28):**  So they're supporting all these groups and people get to come together.  
**[1:00:33-1:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:00:33):**  And it's so incredibly popular, this bread works place.  
**[1:00:38-1:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:00:38):**  Incredible.  
**[1:00:39-1:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:00:39):**  Because it's no big deal.  
**[1:00:40-1:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:00:40):**  You show up, you pay five bucks and whatever it is, and you get a pizza there and you see  
**[1:00:46-1:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:00:46):**  all the people who are there for say this, the school, that's the fundraiser this week,  
**[1:00:51-1:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:00:51):**  or this farm, the fundraiser the following week.  
**[1:00:53-1:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:00:53):**  And you meet these people, some of the people, you know, the neighbors are the ones you meet  
**[1:00:57-1:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:00:57):**  new people, you get a pizza and the group is supporting the profits for that Wednesday.  
**[1:01:03-1:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:01:03):**  They have a regular making business that's quite big.  
**[1:01:07-1:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:01:07):**  But that Wednesday, all the profits go to that one group.  
**[1:01:11-1:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:01:11):**  It's fabulous.  
**[1:01:12-1:01:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:01:12):**  Nothing brings together people like food.  
**[1:01:15-1:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:01:15):**  I can I can show you I can send you the video clip of that.  
**[1:01:19-1:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:01:19):**  We did a video, the Miller run, we do virtual programs, we did a video clip of that showing  
**[1:01:24-1:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:01:24):**  the gathering.  
**[1:01:25-1:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:01:25):**  Listen to it's great.  
**[1:01:27-1:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:01:27):**  So you have if you have a farm, you open land, you might want to do certain things that would  
**[1:01:31-1:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:01:31):**  get people to come and share some food.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:01:34):**  And you know,  
**[1:01:35-1:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:01:35):**  yeah, that was one of the first things that I thought about, too, because we tried to  
**[1:01:39-1:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:01:39):**  do something similar when I lived back in Guatemala.  
**[1:01:42-1:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:01:42):**  And we were struggling for a while, like we spent a lot of our efforts in the beginning  
**[1:01:45-1:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:01:45):**  and building the house and getting established so we could actually live there.  
**[1:01:49-1:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:01:49):**  But over time, we were noticing that we didn't have the amount of people coming by and the  
**[1:01:53-1:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:01:53):**  communication and the collaboration that we were hoping for in the beginning.  
**[1:01:57-1:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:01:57):**  And one of the first things that we identified is like, well, we don't have a big enough  
**[1:02:00-1:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:02:00):**  table to host more people.  
**[1:02:03-1:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:02:03):**  And right, as soon as we realized that our infrastructure was limiting the amount of  
**[1:02:06-1:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:02:06):**  people that we could actually accommodate to come over, we realized that one of the  
**[1:02:10-1:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:02:10):**  easiest things that you can do is just build a larger table.  
**[1:02:13-1:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:02:13):**  Exactly.  
**[1:02:14-1:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:02:14):**  And here they didn't, they built a large shelter, so they could have picnic tables underneath  
**[1:02:19-1:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:02:19):**  it.  
**[1:02:21-1:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:02:21):**  Because the rain.  
**[1:02:22-1:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:02:22):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[1:02:23-1:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:02:23):**  And it's only summer because but you know, it was great.  
**[1:02:25-1:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:02:25):**  Unfortunately, now they have sellout, we have no, we only have so many people could handle.  
**[1:02:30-1:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:02:30):**  Right.  
**[1:02:31-1:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:02:31):**  That's a good problem to have.  
**[1:02:33-1:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:02:33):**  But I mean, it's a really good example of how you can actually create infrastructure  
**[1:02:37-1:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:02:37):**  that it promotes collaboration and community.  
**[1:02:41-1:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:02:41):**  Absolutely.  
**[1:02:42-1:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:02:42):**  These communal spaces are essential.  
**[1:02:44-1:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:02:44):**  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  
**[1:02:46-1:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:02:46):**  I was involved with the bike system for the city of King.  
**[1:02:51-1:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:02:51):**  We said to him 30 years ago, you don't have any bike system here.  
**[1:02:57-1:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:02:57):**  The roads are dangerous kids, you know.  
**[1:02:59-1:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:02:59):**  It's as well, we tried it, but no one was interested.  
**[1:03:03-1:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:03:03):**  Well, we'll give it a shot.  
**[1:03:05-1:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:03:05):**  That's it.  
**[1:03:06-1:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:03:06):**  No one is interested.  
**[1:03:07-1:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:03:07):**  So we spent two, three months, not, not very much money, but we got everyone to show up,  
**[1:03:12-1:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:03:12):**  the governor, the mayor, not the mayor and the city council and local people, vice vice  
**[1:03:16-1:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:03:16):**  people are there.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:03:17):**  And then we brought all these blank maps and says, Okay, we want to design master plan  
**[1:03:23-1:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:03:23):**  for all the bicycling paths for the city.  
**[1:03:25-1:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:03:25):**  And you're going to you're here to do it, you know, the city better I do.  
**[1:03:28-1:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:03:28):**  So we brought up three groups, they have these big plans that have all the roads, they started  
**[1:03:32-1:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:03:32):**  designing the master plan for the bike system, then we put them all three together.  
**[1:03:39-1:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:03:39):**  We gave the city council here's a proposed master plan.  
**[1:03:43-1:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:03:43):**  It's now have raised millions of dollars, living edible growing bike path system, they  
**[1:03:49-1:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:03:49):**  have priority one priority to you know what I mean.  
**[1:03:52-1:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:03:52):**  But the process of everyone designing the bikes, and then they created their own nonprofit  
**[1:03:58-1:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:03:58):**  from this pathways for King.  
**[1:04:02-1:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:04:02):**  Because they, they, they talk to each other, they like this, they want to do this, they  
**[1:04:06-1:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:04:06):**  created now the five one c three nonprofit, they raised the matching funds for the federal  
**[1:04:09-1:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:04:09):**  money and all that.  
**[1:04:10-1:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:04:10):**  So you it's getting these people together, the shares of commonality.  
**[1:04:14-1:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:04:14):**  I love that example.  
**[1:04:16-1:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:04:16):**  Well, look, Jim, we're starting to come to the end of our time.  
**[1:04:21-1:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:04:21):**  And I have done my best to listen to what you're talking about in the ways that we talked  
**[1:04:25-1:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:04:25):**  about listening more deeply.  
**[1:04:27-1:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:04:27):**  And especially when it comes to asking those important questions, I want to end this interview  
**[1:04:31-1:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:04:31):**  by asking you, what did I forget to ask?  
**[1:04:37-1:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:04:37):**  That's a good question.  
**[1:04:39-1:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:04:39):**  Well,  
**[1:04:41-1:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:04:41):**  I think maybe why did I bother writing this book?  
**[1:04:44-1:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:04:44):**  How about that one, then why did you bother right writing this book?  
**[1:04:48-1:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:04:48):**  I started to retire after you know, it's 70.  
**[1:04:52-1:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:04:52):**  And I wanted to leave something behind.  
**[1:04:55-1:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:04:55):**  Well, I think this book is a fantastic example of successful community endeavors from around  
**[1:05:02-1:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:05:02):**  the world.  
**[1:05:03-1:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:05:03):**  I personally got a ton of new ideas of things and activities and processes that I could  
**[1:05:09-1:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:05:09):**  perhaps trial in this new project that I had mentioned earlier, and has given me a lot  
**[1:05:13-1:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:05:13):**  of hope that these processes are are worth investing in, and are possible in some of  
**[1:05:21-1:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:05:21):**  the most bleak environments and scenarios that many of us lose hope in.  
**[1:05:26-1:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:05:26):**  And so at least for those reasons, I really encourage people to take a look and hopefully  
**[1:05:31-1:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:05:31):**  get some more inspiration the way that I did from this book, building community.  
**[1:05:35-1:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:05:35):**  Thank you.  
**[1:05:36-1:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:05:36):**  And I really enjoyed your thoughtful questions.  
**[1:05:40-1:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:05:40):**  And I think your future plans are right in line with what I think we really have a lot  
**[1:05:45-1:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:05:45):**  of joy in your life.  
**[1:05:46-1:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:05:46):**  Well, I'll keep in touch with you.  
**[1:05:48-1:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:05:48):**  I'm sure I will reach out again for some advice as I move forward in this plan.  
**[1:05:52-1:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:05:52):**  And certainly getting that language down is the first step.  
**[1:05:55-1:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:05:55):**  All right.  
**[1:05:56-1:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dr-james-guber-on-the-key-principles-of-how-communities-thrive/#t=1:05:56):**  Well, thanks very much for your kind interview questions and really enjoyed this.

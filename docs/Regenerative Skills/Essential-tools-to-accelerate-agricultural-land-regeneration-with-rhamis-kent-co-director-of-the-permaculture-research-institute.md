**[0:06:00-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:06:00):**  it wasn't necessarily the thing I had aspired to when I first had decided to study engineering.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:06:10):**  It was just something that I kind of fell into.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:06:13):**  And I had an opportunity to actually work on some interesting things, but it wasn't  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:06:17):**  necessarily kind of my life's aspiration.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:06:22):**  Funnily enough, the first job I had out of college was I worked for Dean Kamen.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:06:28):**  He's the guy who invented the Segway, among other things.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:06:33):**  So I worked for Dean before the Segway was released.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:06:37):**  So I remember seeing test parts and things come out of the machine shop during the time  
**[0:06:43-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:06:43):**  that I worked for him.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:06:44):**  So it was like a Skunk Works project.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:06:48):**  And I remember the way folks were talking about it before it was released that it was  
**[0:06:51-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:06:51):**  going to change the way the cities were designed.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:06:54):**  And it was that kind of thing.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:06:56):**  But I eventually moved to California in the mid to late 90s.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:07:05):**  And that's ultimately where I discovered several years later, I became familiar with permaculture  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:07:10):**  by meeting someone who worked for Jeff and Audia Lawton.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:07:15):**  And then I eventually met the Lawtons while they were doing a sort of a tour of courses  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:07:23):**  and talks in Northern California in summer 2008.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:07:29):**  And then I eventually went down to go study with them during probably the first or second  
**[0:07:34-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:07:34):**  quarter of 2009.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:07:37):**  And it was during that time that I was in Australia that I decided that this was what  
**[0:07:42-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:07:42):**  I wanted to do, or at least make an attempt at trying to make it work.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:07:49):**  I was able to take my experiences in engineering and combine it with some of the interests  
**[0:07:56-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:07:56):**  and have it be couched in the structure of permaculture.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:08:06):**  Nice.

**[0:08:14-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:08:14):**  me about some of the projects that you've become known for and some of the other organizations

**[0:08:24-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:08:24):**  But I've known you for your stuff.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:08:26):**  You're working Jordan, like you were saying.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:08:28):**  You're starting to teach on that now, especially the dry land context, stuff in North Africa  
**[0:08:33-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:08:33):**  and East Africa as well.

**[0:08:45-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:08:45):**  connection to Jeff and Nadia.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:08:46):**  So I first went there in 2011 for the international permaculture convergence.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:08:55):**  And that was really my initial foray into the region.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:09:01):**  So I had a chance to see what is now the permaculture, I'm sorry, the Greening the Desert II site.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:09:11):**  I first saw it as it was starting to be developed again in 2011.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:09:16):**  That's why I first made contact with my friend, Maral Del Hufash in Palestine.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:09:22):**  So I've taught a couple of times in Palestine.

**[0:28:08-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:28:08):**  is locusts, when they swarm and they overtake a place, they favor areas that are degraded  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:28:24):**  because the vegetation there is the type of vegetation that, well, number one, they're  
**[0:28:29-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:28:29):**  capable of eating and that they favor.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:28:31):**  So I've seen in some research papers that apparently you have a number of species of  
**[0:28:41-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:28:41):**  locusts and grasshoppers like to eat vegetation that is nitrogen deficient for one and has

**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:28:55):**  And these are areas that, again, are typically going to be degraded.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:28:59):**  Many of them are going to be areas that have been overgrazed.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:29:02):**  So they don't.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:29:05):**  And this actually feeds into another topic that's in this new article, trophobiosis.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:29:15):**  So there's this trophobiosis theory that says that pests cannot eat healthy plants because  
**[0:29:24-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:29:24):**  there's nothing made available for them to eat.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:29:28):**  So the only way that a pest can eat is if there's a weak plant that is putting off these  
**[0:29:35-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:29:35):**  exudates, these amino acids and simple sugars that they're capable of actually eating.

**[0:29:47-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:29:47):**  So what you'll find is that when you do have these heavy infestations of pests and things  
**[0:29:53-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:29:53):**  like locusts, they're just a diagnostic for an area that has plants that are suffering  
**[0:30:02-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:30:02):**  from being in a landscape that's not capable of providing them with the nutrition that

**[0:30:10-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:30:10):**  So again, this is another indication that this is another reason to take up this earth  
**[0:30:20-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:30:20):**  repair agenda, as I call it, seriously and to really have it be expanded and funded and  
**[0:30:28-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:30:28):**  employed.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:30:29):**  Well, so let's focus now on how so many of the landscapes around the world, but especially  
**[0:30:35-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:30:35):**  grasslands and what we've used in the past as arable land for farming has become so degraded  
**[0:30:41-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:30:41):**  and what role machinery has played in that process.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:30:45):**  Yeah, so and again, this is what's in my earth repair upscaled piece from, let me write this.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:30:54):**  Yeah, yeah, I'll put a link in the show notes of this so people can check this out in detail  
**[0:30:59-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:30:59):**  and see all the links and the images you put in there.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:31:01):**  Okay, great.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:31:02):**  Yeah, so I think I wrote it like maybe a year, year and a half ago, something like that.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:31:07):**  So heavy equipment, I mean, it's like any tool.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:31:13):**  If the tool isn't used well, if it's not employed in the right way, it can do a lot of damage.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:31:22):**  You can take the same tool and if it's used much more intelligently, it could produce  
**[0:31:31-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:31:31):**  a great deal of benefit.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:31:34):**  The problem with the use of a lot of heavy machinery, say in conventional ag or industrial  
**[0:31:40-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:31:40):**  ag is that one of the main, one of the big issues with degraded landscapes is compaction.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:31:50):**  So areas that you have heavy use of, heavy machinery, big tractors, big trucks, continual  
**[0:31:58-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:31:58):**  use of agricultural implements that are disrupting the structure of soils and the health of soils

**[0:32:10-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:32:10):**  And so if you have problems with compaction, then it's very difficult for vegetation to  
**[0:32:15-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:32:15):**  be able to establish.

**[0:32:38-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:32:38):**  that are effectively, they're toxins, which actually set into motion this whole tropobiosis  
**[0:32:46-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:32:46):**  problem, this phenomenon, all of those things compounds and accelerates the degradation

**[0:33:07-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:33:07):**  for instance, if you read books like Collapse, How Societies Choose to Fail to Succeed by

**[0:35:34-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:35:34):**  So excavators and bulldozers and scrapers and those kinds of pieces of equipment.

**[0:37:57-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:37:57):**  And if we're not thinking in this manner that we can't afford to demonize machines, we're

**[0:38:53-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:38:53):**  You can turn into a weapon.

**[0:38:57-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:38:57):**  The problem is the person who has decided to use the screwdriver in a manner that is

**[0:39:14-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:39:14):**  them, then you can actually come up with a very different outcome.

**[0:39:24-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:39:24):**  put onto mostly tractors at this point and used directly on the land.

**[0:39:41-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:39:41):**  So if you use it, if you're on a relatively small, you know, relatively small piece of  
**[0:39:48-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:39:48):**  land, you know, obviously hand tools are great, you know, things like, you know, Maddox or

**[0:40:10-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:40:10):**  of pieces of equipment and then using those things to put in, you know, water harvesting  
**[0:40:15-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:40:15):**  infrastructure to do soil conditioning.

**[0:40:41-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:40:41):**  you can do a lot of really, really good, thorough work using, you know, a small engine powered

**[0:40:59-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:40:59):**  at the scale you're able to do it for the money that you spend, I think it's a great

**[0:42:03-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:42:03):**  Well, I think some of the things that we had mentioned, that we just mentioned before,

**[0:42:16-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:42:16):**  kind of earth moving equipment like a dozer or an excavator.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:42:21):**  You can find those pretty much anywhere and everywhere.

**[0:42:44-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:42:44):**  So for example, probably one of the better examples that I could point to is again, there's

**[0:43:53-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:43:53):**  And they had this amazing result over, I believe the test area was 12,000 acres, 12 and a half  
**[0:43:59-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:43:59):**  thousand acres was 5,000 hectares.

**[0:44:31-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:44:31):**  batches and then dispersing it?

**[0:44:42-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:44:42):**  a number of different places within the region that again, that the program was implemented,  
**[0:44:49-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:44:49):**  which was in the forest province, which borders the Persian Gulf.  
**[0:44:53-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:44:53):**  So because they're subject to sanctions by a number of countries, they don't necessarily  
**[0:45:06-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:45:06):**  have the benefit of being able to get certain products into the country.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:45:11):**  So all they were doing was using crop wastes in a way that allowed for them to be able  
**[0:45:16-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:45:16):**  to make their own fertilizer.

**[0:45:24-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:45:24):**  And what I think what's amazing is they got increases in their agricultural output while  
**[0:45:31-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:45:31):**  also significantly reducing their water use, like in some cases by two thirds.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:45:41):**  I mean, that's huge for an area that gets such small rainfall.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:45:44):**  Exactly.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:45:45):**  And I think again, this was the thing that in being able to show what kinds of results  
**[0:45:51-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:45:51):**  that they were able to generate again over such a large area, this is what I think gave  
**[0:45:56-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:45:56):**  people a lot of confidence and this is what convinced them that, oh, this is something  
**[0:46:01-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:46:01):**  that actually is real.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:46:04):**  And when we had shown the folks who started the Chivanche fertilizer, the Chivanche farming,  
**[0:46:12-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:46:12):**  quote unquote Chivanche farming project, again, these are the results that convinced them  
**[0:46:17-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:46:17):**  and they've simply replicated what they saw.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:46:22):**  In their case, they began with an area that was one hectare.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:46:27):**  It was a one hectare pilot project farm and I think they were able to actually get that  
**[0:46:37-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:46:37):**  farm established in 10 months.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:46:38):**  A couple of colleagues of mine went and actually helped them put that site together.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:46:46):**  And they went from, within a year, they went from 50 farmers from 50 farms that came to  
**[0:46:52-0:46:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:46:52):**  train at that site and within a year they went to somewhere between 50 to 90,000 farmers  
**[0:46:58-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:46:58):**  that were actually adopting what they saw on the test site.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:47:03):**  That's incredible.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:47:04):**  So, you know, three orders of magnitude, you know, and three orders of back to the increase  
**[0:47:09-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:47:09):**  within a year is, you know, that's a significant increase.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:47:14):**  Very encouraging.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:47:15):**  Again, it demonstrates the viability of these ideas.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:47:19):**  Now and I think it's also significant that, you know, the project that this was started  
**[0:47:28-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:47:28):**  by, that the folks who actually started this project, I mean, Manoj Bhargav is a billionaire,  
**[0:47:33-0:47:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:47:33):**  you know, five hour energy shot.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:47:36):**  I think they captured, they got like 90% of the US market for the energy shot market.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:47:47):**  So to his credit, to Manoj's credit, they've taken that money and he's dedicated like 99%  
**[0:47:58-0:48:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:47:58):**  of his money to philanthropic ventures.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:48:03):**  This is one of the ventures that he's financed.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:48:07):**  And again, I think it more than demonstrates the viability of these ideas to be scaled  
**[0:48:12-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:48:12):**  up.

**[0:48:20-0:48:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:48:20):**  point to go and check out examples like this, or maybe even find more specific information

**[0:48:31-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:48:31):**  of these things for themselves?  
**[0:48:33-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:48:33):**  Well I think, again, I would encourage people to go look up, look up Chivanche Farming.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/essential-tools-to-accelerate-agricultural-land-regeneration-with-rhamis-kent-co-director-of-the-permaculture-research-institute/#t=0:48:39):**  You know, Google search up Chivanche Farming, S-H-I-V-A-N-S-H.

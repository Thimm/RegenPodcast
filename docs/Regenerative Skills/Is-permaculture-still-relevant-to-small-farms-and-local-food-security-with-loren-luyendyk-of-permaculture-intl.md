### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 03 Jul 2020 08:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:00:09):**  You're in the right place for all things regenerative living, ecological restoration,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:00:14):**  permaculture and natural building.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:00:16):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:00:18):**  In this show, it's my job to interview leaders, innovators and rebels on the cutting edge  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:00:22):**  of their fields as we look for solutions to our generation's most urgent challenges  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:00:27):**  and share these techniques and information so that you can join us in creating a healthy  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:00:31):**  and abundant world for everyone.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:00:33):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:00:41):**  Without a doubt, the most important mission of our lifetimes will be regenerating this  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:00:44):**  planet and creating a new culture based on care and stewardship for all life.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:00:49):**  But it can be hard to know where to start.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:00:52):**  After more than 150 episodes of speaking to leaders and innovators in the regenerative  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:00:57):**  fields around the world, and working with clients and organizations to help them reach  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:01:01):**  their regenerative goals, I've compiled many lists of essential skills and steps that  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:01:05):**  anyone can take today to begin their journey towards a brighter future for themselves,  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:01:10):**  their families and communities, and for the ecosystems that support them.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:01:14):**  Every two weeks, I'll send you a new regenerative skill that you can develop and expand on in  
**[0:01:19-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:01:19):**  your own life right away.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:01:20):**  What's more is that I'm creating a community of skill builders like you who are sharing  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:01:25):**  their results and stories of success to inspire you towards greater action.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:01:29):**  You can sign up right now in the show notes for this episode or on the homepage at abundantedge.com.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:01:35):**  Start your week off right by building your skills for a regenerative future.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:01:41):**  In my opinion, permaculture has done an incredible job of raising awareness of natural land management  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:01:46):**  techniques and teaching people to observe and read patterns from the natural world to  
**[0:01:51-0:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:01:51):**  inform their interactions with the environment.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:01:54):**  But it often gets criticized for being impractical when it comes to applying its methods to profitable  
**[0:01:58-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:01:58):**  farming enterprises.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:01:59):**  There's a long running line of questioning on this show, especially when I'm speaking  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:02:03):**  with producers and farmers about where they have to compromise their choices for the earth  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:02:08):**  with the needs of their businesses and the efficiency required to turn a profit.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:02:12):**  So to help me get to the bottom of this paradox, I spoke to Lauren Leyendeig, a certified teacher  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:02:17):**  of permaculture with over 17 years of practical experience in permaculture design, sustainability,  
**[0:02:22-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:02:22):**  and horticulture.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:02:24):**  Lauren has also studied and has loads of experience in the fields of organic and biodynamic farming,  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:02:29):**  arboriculture, agroecology, keyline design, holistic management, natural building, and  
**[0:02:34-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:02:34):**  the soil food web.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:02:35):**  And he's also a founding partner of Permaculture Design International, an international design  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:02:40):**  collaborative with the express goal of increasing the professionalism and adoption of permaculture  
**[0:02:46-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:02:46):**  globally, especially with larger scale projects.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:02:49):**  He and his wife Aubrey Falk also co-founded the nonprofit organization Surfers Without  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:02:54):**  Borders in 2008, which promotes practical solutions to ocean pollution through regenerative  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:02:59):**  design.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:03:00):**  Now in this interview, we break down some of the most important ways that permaculture  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:03:03):**  can be applied, especially to small farms, not only to improve the health of the ecology  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:03:08):**  on the site like it's known to do, but also the financial bottom line of the business  
**[0:03:13-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:03:13):**  owner.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:03:14):**  Lauren explains how a lot of common practices and teachings in permaculture like crop diversification,  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:03:19):**  building soil health, and harvesting water on site can make a huge difference in the  
**[0:03:23-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:03:23):**  viability of a farm.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:03:25):**  We also talk about what a regenerative food system might look like at the community level  
**[0:03:29-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:03:29):**  and how people can get started wherever they are by taking simple steps in the right direction.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:03:35):**  Towards the end, we also nerd out about all the amazing plants and foods that grow in  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:03:39):**  our respective climates, since both northeastern Spain where I live and southwestern California  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:03:44):**  where he is are analog climates to one another and there's a ton of overlap in what we  
**[0:03:48-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:03:48):**  see and grow around us.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:03:50):**  I really enjoyed this chat and can tell just how thoroughly Lauren knows his stuff.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:03:55):**  A mutual friend of ours and previous guests on the podcast, Nicholas Burtner from the  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:03:59):**  School of Permaculture was the one who originally put me in touch with Lauren and turned me  
**[0:04:02-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:04:02):**  on to his work.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:04:03):**  So a big thank you and a shout out to Nick for making the connection.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:04:07):**  With that out of the way, I'll turn things over now to Lauren.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:04:12):**  Hey Lauren, thanks so much for taking the time to speak with me today.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:04:14):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:04:15-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:04:15):**  I'm doing well.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:04:16):**  Thanks, Oliver.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:04:17):**  Thanks for having me.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:04:18):**  It's a pleasure.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:04:19):**  Pleasure to be here.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:04:20):**  Hey, it's my pleasure.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:04:21):**  Yeah, like I was put in touch with you by a couple of previous guests on the podcast  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:04:25):**  and you come very highly recommended and I'm really excited to talk to you about your work  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:04:29):**  and how permaculture is still relevant in kind of a modern farming and regenerative  
**[0:04:35-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:04:35):**  farming context.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:04:37):**  So what do you say we just jump into the questions?  
**[0:04:39-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:04:39):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:04:40):**  Let's do it.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:04:41):**  All right.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:04:42):**  So before we dive too deep into your actual work, why don't you tell our listeners a bit  
**[0:04:45-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:04:45):**  about your personal background and your path into botany and tree care specifically?  
**[0:04:51-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:04:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:04:52):**  So well, as a child, my mother really is the one who introduced me to gardening.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:04:59):**  She always had a garden when I was a kid and I remember we had a king snake that lived  
**[0:05:04-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:05:04):**  in the garden.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:05:05):**  We named him Stevie.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:05:06):**  And so this was like my connection to nature and food production at a really young age  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:05:13):**  and it really carried through the majority of my life.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:05:18):**  And my mother's an artist and then my father is a scientist, he's a geologist.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:05:24):**  And so those two disciplines kind of were different hemispheres of the brain, but the  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:05:31):**  cohesion and the common ground there was designed.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:05:36):**  And so through college I was interested in biology and botany and I was fortunate to  
**[0:05:42-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:05:42):**  have a very loose structure in college and not have to take many prerequisites through  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:05:48):**  a specific program I was taking at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:05:52):**  So I was allowed a lot of freedom and that allowed me to really explore more of the artistic  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:05:58):**  side of science, if you will, and this bridge between the two hemispheres.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:06:04):**  And so I was introduced to permaculture design in Antarctica of all places.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:06:11):**  I had gotten a summer job out of college to run the hydroponic greenhouse in McMurdo Station,  
**[0:06:20-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:06:20):**  Antarctica.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:06:21):**  And that was just a really obviously very different context for producing food.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:06:30):**  But Antarctica and the base itself is such a microcosm kind of for the world and just  
**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:06:38):**  it's a really closed loop system or it has the potential to be a closed loop system.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:06:43):**  And so somebody there said, hey, permaculture would be – we should really look into permaculture  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:06:49):**  principles and techniques here in Antarctica and recycle our waste.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:06:53):**  Because there are a lot of questionable practices going on there.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:06:57):**  It was run by military and military contractors and a lot of waste wasn't being utilized.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:07:04):**  So it was the very beginning of the internet.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:07:07):**  This was in 1998, 99, winter season, summer season in Antarctica.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:07:13):**  And so I started researching permaculture.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:07:15):**  I said, wow, this is really interesting.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:07:17):**  And it so happened that I was – you get a New Zealand visa when you go to Antarctica  
**[0:07:23-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:07:23):**  because you have to go through New Zealand.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:07:24):**  It's a New Zealand dependency, the American base.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:07:27):**  Or it's that Americans have access to Antarctica through New Zealand.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:07:31):**  So I came back to New Zealand with some money in my pocket saved up from working in Antarctica  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:07:37):**  and signed up for a permaculture course.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:07:41):**  There was one happening on the South Island and that was kind of – the rest is history,  
**[0:07:46-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:07:46):**  if you will.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:07:47):**  I was fortunate to find permaculture straight out of college having not really chosen a  
**[0:07:56-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:07:56):**  career path at that point.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:07:57):**  I knew I was interested in plants and permaculture just really introduced this – it was a perfect  
**[0:08:05-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:08:05):**  blend of art and science.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:08:07):**  I call it the art and science of design, of designing human settlements.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:08:10):**  And it really was an eye-opener for me.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:08:14):**  It was very cathartic.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:08:15):**  I was kind of young.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:08:16):**  I was in my early 20s so I had that opportunity.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:08:22):**  I was really lucky to be able to find it early on.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:08:26):**  And then I continued my studies in New Zealand with the biodynamic farming course with Peter  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:08:31):**  Proctor.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:08:33):**  And that was taking it down – taking it to a whole other level, discussing kind of  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:08:40):**  the occult nature of farming and the subtle energies.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:08:45):**  And that really just gave me kind of a very interesting and different perspective than  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:08:51):**  I had gotten in college, with more of a reductionist mindset.  
**[0:08:54-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:08:54):**  And that was always my struggle in college was things seemed to be – in order to study  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:09:01):**  something, they seemed to want to break it into smaller and smaller pieces.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:09:06):**  And what really interested me was seeing the bigger picture.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:09:10):**  And so I was always kind of in a conflict with the – an internal conflict with the  
**[0:09:17-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:09:17):**  path of study and science in college and permaculture and biodynamics really offered a more holistic  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:09:25):**  and a bigger picture perspective that I had been seeking through college.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:09:31):**  So I was able to take the knowledge, the really specific reductionist knowledge that I think  
**[0:09:36-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:09:36):**  is still useful that I gained in college and sort of apply it to more of a systems thinking  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:09:42):**  and a holistic thinking approach.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:09:46):**  So then I came back and I'm in – our teachers in the permaculture course made us take a  
**[0:09:51-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:09:51):**  pledge.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:09:52):**  It was Robin Clayfield and Raveena McCurdy.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:09:54):**  When they made us take a pledge, we sent ourselves a letter.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:09:59):**  Well, we wrote a letter to ourselves and they sent it to us a year later.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:10:05):**  And in the letter it said we were writing to ourselves what are you going to do with  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:10:10):**  your life in the next year.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:10:13):**  And I had said that I wanted to focus on soil building and soil health.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:10:17):**  And so coming back to the United States after my stint in Antarctica, which I extended for  
**[0:10:24-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:10:24):**  a little surfing vacation, post working 54 hours a week or four months straight, I got  
**[0:10:31-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:10:31):**  home and I had an opportunity to manage a ten acre property that was kind of a diversified  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:10:39):**  orchard here in Santa Barbara, California where I'm from.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:10:44):**  And about six months into that I received this letter and I was actively composting  
**[0:10:51-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:10:51):**  and building garden beds and interplanting vegetable crops in between the rows of trees.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:10:58):**  So to get this letter was really affirming that I was on my path.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:11:03):**  And it was a really powerful sort of reflection to me and it was empowering to keep me on  
**[0:11:12-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:11:12):**  my path.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:11:13):**  And so that was in 1999.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:11:15):**  I started my business Santa Barbara Organics with the goal to help anyone and everyone.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:11:23):**  And it ended up being mostly residential clients helped them design their edible landscapes.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:11:31):**  And that was kind of a new thing that was trending was this edible landscaping in early  
**[0:11:37-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:11:37):**  2000s.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:11:39):**  And permaculture was kind of still new.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:11:42):**  I just missed Bill Mollison.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:11:44):**  He did a course here in 97.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:11:46):**  So he planted the seed locally and so the movement here with Wesley Rowe and Margie  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:11:52):**  Bushman, the Santa Barbara Permaculture Network, they started really pushing permaculture locally  
**[0:11:58-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:11:58):**  and we sort of teamed up on some talks and whatnot.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:12:04):**  And I kind of became the new kid on the block here helping people actually get into the  
**[0:12:10-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:12:10):**  nuts and bolts of it.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:12:12):**  And so I started doing designs and installations for people on their whatever scale that really  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:12:19):**  was and this was kind of coupled with my work.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:12:22):**  It was based on the work I did on the 10 acre orchard where I lived for a couple of years.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:12:28):**  So that's kind of a brief history and now where I'm here 20 years in having done several  
**[0:12:36-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:12:36):**  hundred residential and small farm and even medium to large scale farm projects.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:12:45):**  Anything ranging from a couple of vegetable boxes to super large scale sheep stations  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:12:52):**  in New Zealand, kind of several thousand acre projects.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:12:56):**  So I kind of have a really broad range of experience but the majority of my experience  
**[0:13:04-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:13:04):**  is really working on the smaller scale, kind of more the human scale and hyper local.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:13:11):**  So that's where I am now and I've really transitioned more towards nursery work.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:13:18):**  So I became a certified arborist and I specialize in fruit tree care and so that was kind of  
**[0:13:25-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:13:25):**  the niche that I found.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:13:26):**  I really have a love for trees and I really love fruit because I love to eat it.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:13:30):**  So I thought well, might as well take care of fruit trees because you inevitably end  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:13:36):**  up with a basket of fruit here and there.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:13:40):**  And there weren't any companies specializing in fruit trees.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:13:44):**  The arborists mostly take trees down as opposed to plant them.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:13:49):**  So I kind of filled this little niche where I come in and consult for people who have  
**[0:13:54-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:13:54):**  small fruit orchards or a couple trees in their yard or even up to having managed several  
**[0:14:01-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:14:01):**  larger monocultural orchard plantings, specifically avocado and citrus.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:14:08):**  That's kind of the crops around here.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:14:11):**  But for sake of running on, that's where I am now in my company and having branched out  
**[0:14:19-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:14:19):**  into some other design forays and some other nonprofit adventures in between there.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:14:27):**  So that's a brief history of how I got to where I am now.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:14:32):**  So let's explore that more, especially on the farm scale side.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:14:36):**  So in this series, I've already spoken to a lot of people who are managing large farms  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:14:40):**  and are enacting large scale soil building and transforming the way that food production  
**[0:14:45-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:14:45):**  is done around the world.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:14:47):**  But a lot of people, especially right now, are looking into how they can produce food  
**[0:14:52-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:14:52):**  in the scale that they have access to.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:14:54):**  Most people don't own large farms.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:14:56):**  And so tell me about some of the differences in what you look to do in a design for a small  
**[0:15:01-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:15:01):**  scale farm in contrast to something that you do for, say, a residential landscape food  
**[0:15:07-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:15:07):**  production.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:15:08):**  What are those key differences?  
**[0:15:09-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:15:09):**  Yeah, I think it's really, you know, one thing I've learned through design and specifically  
**[0:15:16-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:15:16):**  holistic management is just the concept of context and not just context in a geographic  
**[0:15:27-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:15:27):**  or meteorological sense, but in a psychological and moral and ethical sense having to do with  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:15:35):**  the human elements, the human participants in the system.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:15:40):**  So really, there's no one size fits all or silver bullet for designing properties because  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:15:50):**  it really is based on the humans that are managing it.  
**[0:15:54-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:15:54):**  So this is kind of a really big catharsis or like an aha moment for me in my design  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:16:01):**  career is understanding this context.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:16:05):**  And so that's kind of a, it's very nuanced and it's often very hard to kind of tease  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:16:12):**  out of people is to figure out what their context is because most people tend to want  
**[0:16:17-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:16:17):**  to focus straight in on, well, what type of tree should I plan or where should I put my  
**[0:16:23-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:16:23):**  veggie garden?  
**[0:16:24-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:16:24):**  They want to go straight into the details.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:16:26):**  And so it is often harder and it's not quite as sexy maybe to discuss your morals and your  
**[0:16:34-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:16:34):**  ethics and your future resource base, et cetera, and your holistic context.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:16:40):**  So we kind of have to get it out of people through different methods, but that's really  
**[0:16:46-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:16:46):**  honestly the most important piece in designing your edible landscape and your food production  
**[0:16:55-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:16:55):**  system is how you integrate into it and how does it fit with your values.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:17:03):**  And so, because often I've seen people design systems that are way beyond their management  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:17:10):**  capacity or their skill level and then the systems fail and then they get a sense of  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:17:16):**  failure themselves and that can be really disempowering and it kind of has, you know,  
**[0:17:21-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:17:21):**  it can take a while.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:17:22):**  It's almost traumatic for people to fail at like if they kill a tomato plant or something,  
**[0:17:28-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:17:28):**  people will sometimes not plant another tomato plant for many years because of that failure.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:17:34):**  So this is, it's kind of a nuanced thing where you're really trying to dive into and seeing  
**[0:17:44-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:17:44):**  you as the person designing your own system.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:17:47):**  You know, why am I doing this?  
**[0:17:51-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:17:51):**  What are my goals?  
**[0:17:54-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:17:54):**  How much time?  
**[0:17:56-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:17:56):**  What kind of a lifestyle do I want to create?  
**[0:17:58-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:17:58):**  How does this activity contribute to the world I want to create?  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:18:05):**  You know, because it is, it's one piece in the big puzzle of life.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:18:10):**  I'll be it, you know, for my opinion, an important piece.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:18:14):**  So that's kind of the big like meta framework for how to approach designing systems.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:18:22):**  And so what's the overlap?  
**[0:18:24-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:18:24):**  It could be because on any scale, your context is important.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:18:31):**  And so somebody like Gabe Brown, who's farming thousands of acres, his con, what he's doing  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:18:37):**  fits his context.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:18:39):**  And that's why he's been successful because he had maybe had a very good internal compass  
**[0:18:44-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:18:44):**  and maybe also had some guidance along the way, but he knew what he wanted to do and  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:18:51):**  why he wanted to do it and he did it within his needs, within his resources available  
**[0:18:57-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:18:57):**  to him.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:18:58):**  And so that's why he's been successful.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:19:00):**  So that's really because everybody, we just all want to be successful in what we're doing.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:19:06):**  So I think that is the most important piece is to design a system that fits your goals,  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:19:12):**  visions, lifestyle, and the world you want to create.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:19:17):**  So that's kind of the overlap.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:19:21):**  That's the big overlap.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:19:22):**  But I mean, then we can get into the nuts and bolts of it because it's really just a  
**[0:19:27-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:19:27):**  matter of scale.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:19:28):**  Like your quarter acre lot in a residential context is really kind of the microcosm of  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:19:37):**  a thousand acre farm.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:19:41):**  You can have many of the same elements in similar relationships or in the same relationships,  
**[0:19:50-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:19:50):**  these mutually beneficial relationships.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:19:53):**  Like the livestock moving through after you harvest the crop.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:19:59):**  On the broad scale, it might be ruminants moving through.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:20:03):**  On the small scale, it might be fowl like chickens moving through.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:20:08):**  But these same principles apply to the different scales.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:20:13):**  It's just one is human scale and human powered and another might be powered by machinery  
**[0:20:21-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:20:21):**  and dinosaur farts for diesel.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:20:25):**  So does that answer a bit of your question?  
**[0:20:32-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:20:32):**  And then we can kind of dive deeper into it.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:20:34):**  Sure.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:20:35):**  I mean, so one of the things that I learned through investigating this series and talking  
**[0:20:41-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:20:41):**  to other people who really understand the industry of agriculture itself is that sometimes  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:20:47):**  it can seem daunting, especially if you don't have access to much land or the capital to  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:20:51):**  get a bigger farm started, which pretty much everybody who's trying to get into farming  
**[0:20:55-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:20:55):**  is in that situation.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:20:57):**  You think that you have to compete with these large agribusinesses to be solvent as a small  
**[0:21:02-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:21:02):**  enterprise.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:21:03):**  But it actually turns out that only about 30 percent of the world's food is produced  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:21:08):**  through industrial means and with big machinery like that.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:21:12):**  And actually 70 percent or more of the food that all of us consume are produced by these  
**[0:21:17-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:21:17):**  smaller farmers.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:21:18):**  They make up the bulk of really what feeds the world.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:21:24):**  And I found that really inspiring partly because I've done a good bit of farming in my life  
**[0:21:29-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:21:29):**  as well, but also because it gives like a perspective of what you can do with a small  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:21:36):**  piece of land that is intensively managed and really stewarded correctly.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:21:41):**  And it gets really difficult to manage something that is hundreds or thousands of acres large  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:21:47):**  without machinery.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:21:48):**  And it's a reason why all throughout human history we never manage farms like that.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:21:52):**  And so knowing that the systems that you can design, the way that you can condense your  
**[0:21:58-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:21:58):**  resources and manage things that much more intensively in a small area must come into  
**[0:22:04-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:22:04):**  play with a lot of design considerations.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:22:07):**  And what are some of the ways that you help to guide clients and people who come to you  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:22:13):**  for advice to understand sort of the strength of working with a smaller context rather than  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:22:19):**  immediately thinking that you need to scale up an operation in order to have a farm and  
**[0:22:24-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:22:24):**  produce a lot of food?  
**[0:22:26-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:22:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:22:27):**  That's a huge issue.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:22:29):**  And I think it's incredibly, it's unnatural, the current situation, this dichotomy that  
**[0:22:37-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:22:37):**  you've outlined and highlighted, the contrast between industrially produced food and industrial  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:22:45):**  agriculture, the scale that works on, and the true, like where most of the food comes  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:22:51):**  from, which is more human scale systems.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:22:55):**  And so I was recently listening to another podcast with Joel Salatin on Joe Rogan, which  
**[0:23:01-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:23:01):**  was really great to hear.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:23:03):**  Joe's kind of mainstream and Joel is the lunatic farmer.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:23:08):**  And they were discussing this concept of scale.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:23:13):**  And his point, and I'm going to echo this point, is we don't necessarily need to scale  
**[0:23:19-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:23:19):**  up.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:23:20):**  We need to make the large farms scaled.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:23:25):**  We don't need to apply permaculture necessarily to the farms, or we do.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:23:29):**  But what we really need to do is we need to have more, we need to scale up the small farms.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:23:35):**  We need to have many, many more small farms and we need to have many, many more, even  
**[0:23:41-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:23:41):**  backyards producing food.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:23:43):**  Because as you've said, and it's 70 plus percent of the world's food is produced on the human  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:23:49):**  scale.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:23:50):**  It's not produced on the industrial scale.  
**[0:23:52-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:23:52):**  And so this should be a really empowering data point for everyone to realize that, oh,  
**[0:24:01-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:24:01):**  well, it's actually normal people with normal sized lots that are growing the majority of  
**[0:24:08-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:24:08):**  the world's food.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:24:09):**  It's not the 10,000 acre corn farmer with these huge combines.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:24:18):**  While they are feeding the world, but we also know that in order to keep prices high, a  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:24:23):**  lot of that corn can be dumped in the ocean at certain points.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:24:26):**  So there's, when you get into the commodity market, there's all sorts of really weird  
**[0:24:30-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:24:30):**  things that go on in order to keep prices and supply in.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:24:34):**  It's just, I don't, I'm not going to pretend to understand it completely.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:24:40):**  But your point is that on the small scale, these systems can be so much more complex  
**[0:24:49-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:24:49):**  because they are manageable.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:24:51):**  Because you can, on a human scale, you can integrate so many more elements into a smaller  
**[0:24:59-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:24:59):**  system because it can be cared for.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:25:02):**  Because you can actually manage these relationships in a real way in real time.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:25:10):**  And I think it can be done on the very large scale.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:25:14):**  And it has been done, obviously, with examples like Dave Brown and Mark Shepherd and there's  
**[0:25:21-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:25:21):**  several other larger scale examples of farm scale permaculture.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:25:27):**  And I do think, to be totally clear, that's a critical and very important movement and  
**[0:25:34-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:25:34):**  something that I have also been involved with.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:25:37):**  But this, it has been sort of this awareness of what you said, this data point that the  
**[0:25:43-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:25:43):**  majority of the world too, that's produced on the small scale, it's produced on the human  
**[0:25:46-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:25:46):**  scale.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:25:47):**  So how I help people get towards that, again, really depends on their context because it's  
**[0:25:55-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:25:55):**  different for everyone.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:25:57):**  Some people say, I want to grow all my food.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:26:02):**  I just recently had a client and said, I'm going to tear out everything.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:26:06):**  And I want to grow all our food.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:26:08):**  And they had the resources and the time to do that.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:26:12):**  Other people say, well, I could really just want to start with one raised bed.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:26:18):**  And so you have to tease it along and you have to really work within people's means.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:26:26):**  And so it's different for everyone.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:26:31):**  And really what I try to do is focus on their priorities and their goals because if we don't  
**[0:26:38-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:26:38):**  work with where people are at, they're less likely to succeed.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:26:44):**  And it's these little successes that empower people to move forward and take the next step  
**[0:26:49-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:26:49):**  to add that next element.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:26:51):**  So they have their one raised bed and they're able to produce some tomatoes and zucchini  
**[0:26:57-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:26:57):**  and they're like, okay, I'm going to put in another raised bed and I'm going to plant  
**[0:27:00-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:27:00):**  some trees.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:27:02):**  And then next they're going to maybe do some roof rainwater catchment or a gray water system  
**[0:27:08-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:27:08):**  and install a chicken coop.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:27:10):**  So it's a gateway, what they said.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:27:16):**  Permaculture is a gateway to farming.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:27:19):**  That meme that was going around.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:27:21):**  But it's really, so again, it's different for everyone.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:27:25):**  And so a lot of it's really just coaching and trying to figure out where each person's  
**[0:27:32-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:27:32):**  context is.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:27:33):**  And really this is kind of the fact that we have the privilege to discuss the context  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:27:41):**  and choices.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:27:42):**  It really is a privilege because we do live in a, at least you and I both live in a culture  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:27:48):**  where we can go to the store and buy food, at least at this point.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:27:53):**  See how much longer that privilege is around.  
**[0:27:58-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:27:58):**  Exactly.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:27:59):**  And actually this has been a really big wake up call for a lot of people, I think.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:28:04):**  But it is a privilege and totally clear, contrasting to where you came from, we were discussing  
**[0:28:12-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:28:12):**  your time in Guatemala where people are subsistence farmers and they're living on a very, very  
**[0:28:17-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:28:17):**  small budget and they really don't have a choice and they have to grow food, otherwise  
**[0:28:24-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:28:24):**  they're going to starve.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:28:26):**  So we kind of live in a culture where permaculture is kind of nice to have for most people.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:28:34):**  It's not a need to have.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:28:37):**  But that said, our cultures are the ones that consume the majority of the world's resources.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:28:44):**  So it really is a need to have because we kind of directly and indirectly affect habitat  
**[0:28:52-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:28:52):**  degradation and cause desertification and contribute to slave labor the world over with  
**[0:29:00-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:29:00):**  our lifestyle.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:29:01):**  Right.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:29:02):**  So, and a lot of it's based on food consumption and buying it in the store.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:29:08):**  So nobody, I mean you asked nine out of 10 people on the street, do you support slavery?  
**[0:29:15-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:29:15):**  And they'll say no.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:29:16):**  I mean maybe 99 out of a hundred or a hundred out of a hundred.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:29:20):**  Let's hope.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:29:21):**  Yeah, right.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:29:22):**  But then they'll go to the store and they'll buy food that's been raised to slave labor.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:29:28):**  But they just, there's a disconnect because they haven't gone down that rabbit hole.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:29:34):**  But that's why we as a privileged culture need to raise our food.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:29:39):**  And I know I'm kind of preaching to the choir here.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:29:41):**  So point being that we have to encourage people and that's part of the education around this  
**[0:29:49-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:29:49):**  of However Be Connected is to bring to people's awareness the reasons why we need to, like  
**[0:29:56-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:29:56):**  everyone should be participating in their food system at some level, hopefully producing  
**[0:30:02-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:30:02):**  all of their fresh vegetables within their, or purchasing them within their community  
**[0:30:09-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:30:09):**  so that they're contributing.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:30:10):**  It's not that hard.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:30:12):**  I don't think people realize, well I think people are finally starting to realize that  
**[0:30:17-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:30:17):**  the space it takes and the energy that it takes to produce a ton of veggies in most  
**[0:30:23-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:30:23):**  climates, granted some, especially northern climates like Minnesota where I grew up, like  
**[0:30:27-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:30:27):**  there's only a handful of frost free months and so you're going to have to figure out  
**[0:30:31-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:30:31):**  how to preserve them if you want to get a year round supply.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:30:35):**  But in a lot of places where a lot of the populations are concentrated, it doesn't take  
**[0:30:39-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:30:39):**  that much space.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:30:40):**  It's not that difficult to get a lot of your veggie needs especially.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:30:45):**  And then you can start to compound on that and it becomes a more resilient food network  
**[0:30:50-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:30:50):**  like you were talking about with Joel Salatin's podcast.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:30:53):**  And he was on my show a couple of weeks prior to that and echoed a lot of the same messages  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:30:58):**  even kind of more from an initial reaction to all of these changes that were happening  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:31:03):**  from the COVID fallout and you know the lockdowns and stuff.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:31:08):**  And really it's a matter of creating a resilient network that involves community, that involves  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:31:14):**  small producers and certainly in the beginning we're still going to be importing a lot of  
**[0:31:19-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:31:19):**  resources from further away from these larger rural farms and even still from overseas.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:31:25):**  But as we regain the sovereignty and the independence, realizing that everybody can can contribute  
**[0:31:33-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:31:33):**  a little bit to it, there's not going to be a situation in the future where one big shakeup  
**[0:31:39-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:31:39):**  like this can destabilize an entire food network.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:31:42):**  The food network will be much more decentralized and much more independent and at a community  
**[0:31:47-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:31:47):**  level.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:31:48):**  And though there may be some losses in convenience like it may be really affordable to get oranges  
**[0:31:54-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:31:54):**  in February from the southern hemisphere, what you kind of regain by having that resilience  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:32:01):**  is not these sort of panic moments that a lot of communities are starting to enter now.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:32:06):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:32:07):**  And you said regain and that is exactly what's happening because these systems existed prior  
**[0:32:15-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:32:15):**  to the go big movement of the 50s through 70s of farming.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:32:21):**  Most food was type or local prior to the advent of industrial agriculture.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:32:30):**  Every farm or a homestead and pretty much everyone lived on homesteads so they would  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:32:34):**  have these integrated systems where they had the dairy cow, they had the pig to clean up  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:32:38):**  the waste, they had the chickens to eat the veggie scraps and produce the, you know, and  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:32:43):**  then the row crops and then maybe a cash crop and they were growing their fresh vegetables  
**[0:32:48-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:32:48):**  and they were growing their staple crops.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:32:50):**  And so this is, we're really kind of realizing that that was a good system, you know, and  
**[0:32:57-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:32:57):**  it was incredibly just decentralized.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:32:59):**  You know, you had processing centers in almost every community because every community has  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:33:06):**  an agrarian base because that's how we get our food.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:33:11):**  So these systems are, we're now realizing, like I said, well, maybe that wasn't such  
**[0:33:17-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:33:17):**  a bad idea and we do need to decentralize processing facilities and we need to decentralize  
**[0:33:25-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:33:25):**  production as well because there's incredibly, so much more resilience in having everyone  
**[0:33:32-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:33:32):**  on the block, or at least let's say 70% of the people on the block have big gardens versus,  
**[0:33:38-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:33:38):**  you know, 7% of the people on the block have big gardens because when and if, you know,  
**[0:33:44-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:33:44):**  the supply chain completely breaks down, you know, then you can rely on your neighbors  
**[0:33:50-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:33:50):**  and then we can start sharing.  
**[0:33:52-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:33:52):**  And that's, there's so many other like benefits that come from that, not just physical nourishment,  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:34:00):**  but you know, we look at all the different forms of capital that we're building there  
**[0:34:04-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:34:04):**  and social capital and cultural capital are so huge and we've really, you know, that awareness  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:34:10):**  has been another aha moment for me was these different concepts of capital and this concept  
**[0:34:15-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:34:15):**  of social capital is so powerful.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:34:17):**  And I agree.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:34:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:34:19):**  I've been going back to those a lot myself.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:34:22):**  Very powerful.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:34:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:34:24):**  So I think, no, go ahead.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:34:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:34:26):**  I was just going to say, you're absolutely right.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:34:29):**  It is much easier than people think.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:34:32):**  And people, you know, start somewhere, start with a safe to fail.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:34:38):**  Like I'll try something, you know, I'll try planting a couple of tomato plants in a zucchini  
**[0:34:43-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:34:43):**  plant or some chard and kale, depending on what climate you're in and what season it  
**[0:34:48-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:34:48):**  is.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:34:49):**  You know, try a safe to fail experiment and you know, YouTube is your friend in these  
**[0:34:55-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:34:55):**  days.  
**[0:34:56-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:34:56):**  You know, we have to use technology to its advantage.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:34:59):**  So many good resources out there.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:35:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:35:02):**  So many good resources out there, including your podcast and in go, you know, figure it  
**[0:35:07-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:35:07):**  out, do some, a little bit of research in and start there and build on those successes.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:35:14):**  And I think that is the most important thing we can do right now.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:35:17):**  And that's what COVID has really highlighted is that is how fragile our food system is  
**[0:35:23-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:35:23):**  and how important these, these decentralized and hyper local food movements are because,  
**[0:35:30-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:35:30):**  you know, at the end of the day, we're all human and we all need to eat and it creates  
**[0:35:33-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:35:33):**  community cult food is a center point of culture and you travel to intact cultures throughout  
**[0:35:40-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:35:40):**  the world.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:35:41):**  And that's, you know, the culinary traditions are so important and we've kind of lost that,  
**[0:35:47-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:35:47):**  you know, we have such a amalgamation of, of, of cultures, which is, which is amazing  
**[0:35:53-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:35:53):**  and beautiful.  
**[0:35:55-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:35:55):**  Um, but we really, we can build a new culture of food production.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:36:00):**  We can build a new culture of local resilient, of resilient cities, resiliency and resilient  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:36:07):**  cities and, and, you know, feed ourselves from within the city limits.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:36:12):**  That was one of the questions that Joel was talking about, you know, that Joe asked Joel  
**[0:36:16-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:36:16):**  and I really look forward to hearing your interview with him too.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:36:19):**  That's great to hear you interviewed Joel as well.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:36:22):**  Um, you know, Joe asked, can we feed Los Angeles from within, you know, locally?  
**[0:36:29-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:36:29):**  And I did a little research for our local community in Santa Barbara and found that  
**[0:36:34-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:36:34):**  the city owned 10,000 acres of parks and most of those parks are in, are in grass or, you  
**[0:36:44-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:36:44):**  know, in lawn and using it, using two to four acre feet per acre of water per year, an incredible  
**[0:36:51-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:36:51):**  amount of water, the same amount of water that would take to grow an orchard or a farm.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:36:56):**  So I feel like we are in this, this really, really ripe and fertile moment to use a pun,  
**[0:37:05-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:37:05):**  a fertile moment of reclaiming the commons.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:37:09):**  And I feel like we, we need to, as a culture, reclaim these open spaces that are owned,  
**[0:37:16-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:37:16):**  owned by all of us owned by new municipalities and convert them into food production.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:37:21):**  And this is happening in a lot of inner cities throughout the, where, where there's a real  
**[0:37:27-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:37:27):**  need, you know, where people are food insecure, like in Detroit and other places in the Midwest.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:37:35):**  And we believe to replicate that model.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:37:37):**  We need to have thousands of small farms from a quarter acre to four acres inside city limits  
**[0:37:46-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:37:46):**  and within the, the urban role boundary, we need to scale up the number of small farms.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:37:54):**  We don't need to scale up, you know, permaculture necessarily.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:37:57):**  That's, that's the scale up of permaculture really is more small farms producing food  
**[0:38:06-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:38:06):**  locally.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:38:07):**  That's what we need to scale up.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:38:09):**  Definitely.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:38:10):**  Now I want to explore a topic with you that I know someone with your experience has thought  
**[0:38:14-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:38:14):**  about and as I've kind of gained some experience in working with clients and especially at  
**[0:38:18-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:38:18):**  the farm scale, I've started to think about a lot more.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:38:22):**  And it comes from like this concept that Carol Sanford explores in her new book and talking  
**[0:38:29-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:38:29):**  about what regeneration really is and how it's a paradigm shift from thinking about,  
**[0:38:35-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:38:35):**  first of all, starting with, you know, a destructive mindset and then moving towards sustainability.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:38:39):**  And a lot of people still get regeneration wrong because they keep putting their agenda  
**[0:38:44-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:38:44):**  on what nature should be or what it should return to, even if it is a much healthier  
**[0:38:50-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:38:50):**  state than it's currently at.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:38:52):**  And to progress to a truly regenerative mindset, you have to start to think about what nature  
**[0:38:58-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:38:58):**  wants to return to on its own.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:39:00):**  Now, obviously, that's kind of an abstract concept, but it's worth balancing with the  
**[0:39:05-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:39:05):**  agenda that we have for food production, for abundance in our landscapes and for, you know,  
**[0:39:12-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:39:12):**  what we consider resilience, because it's mostly in relationship to how we currently  
**[0:39:16-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:39:16):**  live.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:39:18):**  And so how do you think about balancing what nature wants to be, maybe in the context of  
**[0:39:22-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:39:22):**  trying to get back to the health and the species balance of what it was like before we domineered  
**[0:39:28-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:39:28):**  the landscape and balancing that with what we need to get as a yield and the resources  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:39:36):**  that we have to have to sustain ourselves within that system?  
**[0:39:41-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:39:41):**  Well, absolutely.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:39:43):**  We're the most common mistake is to impose your own ideas onto the landscape.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:39:50):**  So we have an attachment to what we think the system should look like.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:39:56):**  And we impose that as opposed to protracted and thoughtful observation, which is really  
**[0:40:06-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:40:06):**  the foundation of permaculture is to observe the landscape and observe the ecosystems without  
**[0:40:15-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:40:15):**  judgment, with humility, as a critical thinker, and work with the systems that are suitable  
**[0:40:26-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:40:26):**  for that context, for that climatological ecological context.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:40:31):**  And that is a total antithesis to how farming is done now, where you've got the imposition  
**[0:40:40-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:40:40):**  of a system that is often completely foreign in that context.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:40:47):**  For example, in the Kiyama Valley here, which is nearby me, they're growing carrots in the  
**[0:40:54-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:40:54):**  desert.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:40:56):**  The reason they grow the carrots in the desert is because the soil is super sandy and there's  
**[0:41:02-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:41:02):**  so much sunlight and heat that they can grow year round.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:41:06):**  But they're overhead irrigating with three to 30,000 year old fossil water that's mined  
**[0:41:13-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:41:13):**  from thousands of feet below the surface to grow bunny love and earthbound farm carrots.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:41:20):**  Oh, you're talking about the one out by Quail Springs, right?  
**[0:41:24-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:41:24):**  Exactly.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:41:25):**  Yes, I've been there.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:41:27):**  That's expanded tremendously, presumably since you last threw here.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:41:32):**  And so that's the antithesis of protracted and thoughtful observation and regeneration.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:41:40):**  And I think it's a cultural thing because our, again, food is culture and our culture  
**[0:41:45-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:41:45):**  is so, we're so used to consuming these foods that we've been consuming.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:41:51):**  But a lot of the foods we consume have to be on life support in order to survive.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:41:58):**  And by life support, I mean irrigation, fertilization, tillage, all of that's just life support.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:42:04):**  They're like patients in a hospital ward, these vegetables growing in an extremely hostile  
**[0:42:11-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:42:11):**  environment, not suited to them at all.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:42:18):**  So what we need to do is shift our culture of consumption and shift our diets accordingly.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:42:24):**  And so as you were talking, I was thinking about this book called Tending the Wild, which  
**[0:42:30-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:42:30):**  is by M. Pat Anderson.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:42:34):**  It's a really amazing book.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:42:36):**  It's a tome, it's thousands of pages or hundreds of pages, I should say.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:42:41):**  But the story is how the indigenous people were the most sublime horticulturalists to  
**[0:42:48-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:42:48):**  ever walk this landscape, specifically in my region, it was the Chumash people.  
**[0:42:53-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:42:53):**  And so what they worked with nature, they literally worked with nature in taking the  
**[0:43:01-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:43:01):**  native species, the endemic species and cultivating them for, for example, with oaks.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:43:09):**  They cultivated them for larger acorns.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:43:13):**  They would tie the branches down to the ground for ease of harvest.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:43:17):**  They would do quick flash burns underneath the canopies to kill the oak worms and to  
**[0:43:23-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:43:23):**  keep the shrubs from growing up into them.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:43:26):**  So and they cultivated the camas fields.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:43:29):**  The camas was like one of the major staple crops of many, many tribes throughout California.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:43:35):**  And they would expand the camas.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:43:36):**  They were constantly replanting and improving not only habitat, because these were all native  
**[0:43:43-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:43:43):**  species, but their food supply.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:43:45):**  So it was this, it's a really profound book, but it's so when you really look at it and  
**[0:43:51-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:43:51):**  think about it, you're like, oh, it makes so much sense that when you come into a climate,  
**[0:43:56-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:43:56):**  the first thing you do when you come into a site is you look around and you see what  
**[0:44:01-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:44:01):**  are the native species growing there?  
**[0:44:03-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:44:03):**  What are the weed species that are thriving?  
**[0:44:07-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:44:07):**  And then you start to look at the ecosystem processes around all that.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:44:11):**  And that's the foundation for your food system.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:44:15):**  You really have to work, you have to work with what is currently there.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:44:22):**  And in certain cases, there is a lot of opportunity to introduce analogous species.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:44:28):**  Like for example, where you are in Spain, you've got the dejesus systems and these montados,  
**[0:44:36-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:44:36):**  which are the very evolved and sublimely managed horticultural systems that rely on some agronomic  
**[0:44:46-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:44:46):**  crops.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:44:47):**  Olive, cork, oak, carob, different types of herbs and flowers and grains, and then the  
**[0:44:56-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:44:56):**  livestock that raises under them.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:44:58):**  And specifically the American pigs.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:45:01):**  The hominids.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:45:03):**  They come around here all the time.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:45:05):**  Yeah, I bet.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:45:07):**  And that's probably one of the better examples of, at least in the formatic training climate,  
**[0:45:15-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:45:15):**  of a system that works in harmony with nature.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:45:18):**  And that's really what regenerative agriculture is, is it's farming in harmony with nature.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:45:25):**  So we need to figure out, and this is the gift we've been given of cognitive thinking  
**[0:45:33-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:45:33):**  and a brain, is to be able to observe systems and see things that thrive and notice connections  
**[0:45:43-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:45:43):**  that are beneficial and magnify those and replicate them.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:45:47):**  And then take these analogs from other climates that are similar to ours and introduce them  
**[0:45:52-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:45:52):**  to our region.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:45:54):**  So for California, like the Central Valley, what was it prior?  
**[0:45:59-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:45:59):**  It was a giant oak savanna with valley oak, 250 foot canopy, several hundred year old  
**[0:46:09-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:46:09):**  valley oaks that produce these amazing acorns with tule elk and pronghorn antelope grazing  
**[0:46:16-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:46:16):**  underneath.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:46:17):**  So it was a savanna system.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:46:19):**  It's very similar to the montado and dehesus system.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:46:24):**  That's what existed in the Central Valley of California.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:46:28):**  And so what would be the best system to replicate or to replace the industrial agriculture?  
**[0:46:37-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:46:37):**  It'd be very likely an oak based savanna system, similar to the montado and dehesus at scale.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:46:45):**  And that's really, the trees are, I'm an arborist, so I'm a little biased, but the lack of trees  
**[0:46:56-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:46:56):**  and the destination of trees in the landscape is one of the biggest crimes against humanity  
**[0:47:04-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:47:04):**  in the history of our evolution, in my opinion, because trees are the permanent agriculture.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:47:10):**  Trees are the keystone species in any agriculture system.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:47:15):**  And they form the foundation, not only in the ecosystem services, but are unlimited.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:47:24):**  And so what I really have been pushing for here locally, like really specifically is  
**[0:47:30-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:47:30):**  convincing and trying to get data points to convince, in quotes, farmers and ranchers to  
**[0:47:38-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:47:38):**  reintroduce trees into the landscape.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:47:41):**  And not necessarily native trees, but any tree that will work and that is hardy in our  
**[0:47:46-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:47:46):**  climate.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:47:47):**  And I've really been focusing on mulberry with livestock systems because mulberry, as  
**[0:47:53-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:47:53):**  you may know, is probably very likely the original hay was mulberry leaves.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:48:01):**  And before they came up with combines and baling oat hay, it was tree hay.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:48:09):**  Mulberry, poplar, willow, aspen, elm, all these in Europe specifically.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:48:19):**  Tree hay was the original hay and it was the foundation, the keystone species in the system,  
**[0:48:28-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:48:28):**  not only because mulberry provides fruit, but because they provide that hay and the  
**[0:48:34-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:48:34):**  shade and all those ecosystem functions that we're discussing.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:48:39):**  So I've been doing leaf sampling, working with the UC Agricultural and Natural Resources  
**[0:48:45-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:48:45):**  Division, and testing the forest quality of the mulberry leaves so that the cattlemen,  
**[0:48:56-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:48:56):**  the grazers can look at it and be like, oh, well, mulberry is actually better than alfalfa  
**[0:49:03-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:49:03):**  in terms of crude protein and digestible fiber, et cetera.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:49:09):**  And it doesn't take nearly the amount of water and it's a perennial.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:49:14):**  You don't need to till.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:49:15):**  And you could actually even grow alfalfa under the mulberry and have two crops.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:49:22):**  So it's like, imagine if you had all these fields of alfalfa, which are not going to  
**[0:49:27-0:49:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:49:27):**  be planted anymore because of the SGMA, Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, and that's a whole  
**[0:49:31-0:49:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:49:31):**  nother rabbit hole we could go down.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:49:33):**  The same reason the carrot fields are in Kuyama or at their death knell.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:49:39):**  But imagine if you just planted a strip of mulberry every 30 feet in the middle of your  
**[0:49:44-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:49:44):**  alfalfa field and you integrated the mulberry into that system and started utilizing that  
**[0:49:50-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:49:50):**  as a hay.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:49:52):**  If we replaced alfalfa with mulberry, we could probably reduce water use in California by  
**[0:49:59-0:50:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:49:59):**  50 to 75%.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:50:01):**  Because alfalfa is the single largest agricultural water user in the state.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:50:09):**  And it goes to animal feed, mostly for dairy cows.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:50:14):**  And then when you really look at mulberry, the dairy production goes up 50% with mulberry  
**[0:50:21-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:50:21):**  leaves as a feedstock.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:50:25):**  So it's like this no brainer.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:50:27):**  So that's kind of a specific example of, and that is honestly an imposition of what's best  
**[0:50:37-0:50:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:50:37):**  in the system, but it's a baby step and it's because we have to really again work with  
**[0:50:42-0:50:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:50:42):**  where people are at.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:50:43):**  You can't just come up to the big Central Valley farmer and say, all right, we're tearing  
**[0:50:48-0:50:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:50:48):**  everything out and we're planting Valley Oaks and going to raise Tule Elk.  
**[0:50:53-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:50:53):**  And they're going to look at you, they're going to probably pull out the shotgun.  
**[0:50:57-0:51:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:50:57):**  So we need to work with where people are at and take these baby steps and be humble and  
**[0:51:02-0:51:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:51:02):**  understand.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:51:03):**  So I think that's like a regeneration of relationships.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:51:09):**  And that's kind of the foundation.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:51:12):**  We need to regenerate the social contracts and the relationship we have with not only  
**[0:51:20-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:51:20):**  our food, but our food producers, because they have been villainized very much so by  
**[0:51:26-0:51:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:51:26):**  our sector of the movement of the permaculture regenerative ag movement.  
**[0:51:32-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:51:32):**  I feel like we need to come to grips with the fact that they still produce, industrial  
**[0:51:37-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:51:37):**  agriculture still produces a large portion, albeit 30%, they're mostly staple crops.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:51:45):**  And we need to work with where they're at, be humble and figure out what's best for the  
**[0:51:51-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:51:51):**  context of not only the site, climatologically, soils, and the context of the farmer, because  
**[0:52:01-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:52:01):**  they're the one who's on the ground actually making it happen.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:52:04):**  So that was kind of a roundabout answer for what does regeneration look like and what  
**[0:52:10-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:52:10):**  is true regeneration.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:52:13):**  It really has to happen on all those different eight levels of capital.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:52:19):**  And the true ecological regeneration absolutely is, it's like completely opposite of what  
**[0:52:26-0:52:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:52:26):**  we're doing now with industrial agriculture, which is a big bridge to cross.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:52:33):**  It's a big gap.  
**[0:52:34-0:52:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:52:34):**  So we need to start somewhere.  
**[0:52:36-0:52:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:52:36):**  Well, I'm really glad that you used that example with the mulberry trees as tree hay and such,  
**[0:52:41-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:52:41):**  because where you live in Santa Barbara is an analog climate for where I am here in Northeastern  
**[0:52:47-0:52:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:52:47):**  Spain and Catalunya.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:52:49):**  And it's a fantastic specific example for our two climates, but it also really illustrates  
**[0:52:54-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:52:54):**  that larger point that you were getting at is that there were native systems in place,  
**[0:53:01-0:53:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:53:01):**  mostly based around perennial crops, that provided all the needs for the people who  
**[0:53:05-0:53:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:53:05):**  live there while providing for all of the ecological services, the habitat, and everything  
**[0:53:09-0:53:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:53:09):**  else that we need for stable ecosystems.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:53:13):**  And the fact that you focus with and work a lot on tree systems is relevant to most  
**[0:53:19-0:53:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:53:19):**  climates around the world, most ecosystems.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:53:22):**  Now there are some exceptions where prairies or tundra and other places with very, very  
**[0:53:27-0:53:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:53:27):**  sparse trees were much more dominant, but most of the places where people live today  
**[0:53:33-0:53:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:53:33):**  have at least a fair spattering of trees in their history as something to look back on  
**[0:53:39-0:53:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:53:39):**  on a healthy state of where the ecosystem was before we started to domineer it.  
**[0:53:43-0:53:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:53:43):**  And now that you're focusing a lot on nursery work and breeding trees and helping to make  
**[0:53:51-0:53:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:53:51):**  these available for reforestation operations, for orchards and such, that's one of the things  
**[0:53:57-0:54:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:53:57):**  that I would really love, just for me personally even, to get more information on.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:54:01):**  What advice would you give for someone to look into, first of all, the trees that they  
**[0:54:06-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:54:06):**  need to be breeding that are appropriate for their area that would help to solve problems  
**[0:54:11-0:54:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:54:11):**  and create yields for the context they're in?  
**[0:54:15-0:54:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:54:15):**  And then we can later start exploring a little bit about how to get a small nursery started  
**[0:54:19-0:54:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:54:19):**  and how to start trialing some of these things.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:54:22):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:54:24):**  Again, it's about observation.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:54:28):**  Walk around your neighborhood, walk around the mountains, the wildlands, what thrives,  
**[0:54:34-0:54:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:54:34):**  what grows with little care, and what produces a tangible yield that is valuable.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:54:42):**  In our climate here in Santa Barbara, we have so many options.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:54:46):**  It's really kind of daunting.  
**[0:54:49-0:54:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:54:49):**  And it's a luxury problem, really, to have such a large pallet, a plantless pallet that's  
**[0:54:57-0:54:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:54:57):**  pages long.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:54:59):**  So that's where you start first, is you start looking at what works locally and what did  
**[0:55:05-0:55:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:55:05):**  the traditional cultures in your specific region grow?  
**[0:55:13-0:55:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:55:13):**  What did they produce?  
**[0:55:14-0:55:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:55:14):**  Here in California, there's the oak I mentioned, that is probably the single largest food waste  
**[0:55:23-0:55:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:55:23):**  in the entire state, is billions and maybe trillions of pounds of acorns that fall on  
**[0:55:30-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:55:30):**  the ground every year and just rot.  
**[0:55:33-0:55:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:55:33):**  And this was the cornerstone of cultures, millennia of cultures, was acorn meal.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:55:41):**  And so currently, we just let it fall to the ground because we've got wheat from the Midwest  
**[0:55:47-0:55:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:55:47):**  or soybeans or whatever.  
**[0:55:49-0:55:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:55:49):**  So the lowest hanging fruit, the least change for the greatest possible effect for California  
**[0:55:55-0:55:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:55:55):**  is like, let's go out there, let's have a movement to harvest all the acorns that are  
**[0:55:59-0:56:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:55:59):**  falling on the ground and let's start there.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:56:02):**  You know, because that's already happening.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:56:04):**  We don't need to plant a single tree.  
**[0:56:07-0:56:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:56:07):**  They're already dropping fruit.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:56:10):**  And I know that half that same scenario exists in a lot of regions because we're so myopic  
**[0:56:18-0:56:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:56:18):**  with our cultural culinary pursuits that we don't really notice the food that's just falling  
**[0:56:27-0:56:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:56:27):**  on the ground all around us.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:56:30):**  So foraging in a suburban and an urban setting is legitimate.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:56:37):**  Here in Santa Barbara, there's loquat.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:56:40):**  Oh, don't even get me started on loquats, man.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:56:43):**  It's loquat season here.  
**[0:56:44-0:56:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:56:44):**  I've never lived in an area where they grow.  
**[0:56:47-0:56:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:56:47):**  There's so many trees around here between just planted out in public spaces and in people's  
**[0:56:52-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:56:52):**  yards that nobody is harvesting, not even the ones in people's yards.  
**[0:56:57-0:56:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:56:57):**  Nobody's harvesting those.  
**[0:56:58-0:57:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:56:58):**  Nobody's harvesting the mulberries.  
**[0:57:00-0:57:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:57:00):**  I walk by every day so much food that people go to the store and pay many euros per pound  
**[0:57:07-0:57:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:57:07):**  to get.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:57:09):**  It's all for free out here.  
**[0:57:10-0:57:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:57:10):**  I don't know where that disconnect is.  
**[0:57:12-0:57:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:57:12):**  It's not even difficult to identify stuff.  
**[0:57:14-0:57:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:57:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:57:15):**  And so that's the first major climate change we need is the climate change of the mind.  
**[0:57:21-0:57:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:57:21):**  It's like change the climate between your ears and really start looking and you don't  
**[0:57:25-0:57:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:57:25):**  have any land?  
**[0:57:26-0:57:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:57:26):**  Well, I guarantee you there's dozens of trees nearby you, fruit trees that are dropping  
**[0:57:33-0:57:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:57:33):**  edible food that you could harvest.  
**[0:57:35-0:57:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:57:35):**  You don't need to have land.  
**[0:57:37-0:57:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:57:37):**  The Native Americans never owned land.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:57:39):**  This concept is so foreign.  
**[0:57:41-0:57:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:57:41):**  Yeah, good point.  
**[0:57:43-0:57:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:57:43):**  So yeah, for example, loquat, it's ubiquitous.  
**[0:57:48-0:57:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:57:48):**  And there's so many products you can make with.  
**[0:57:50-0:57:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:57:50):**  They call it nispero.  
**[0:57:53-0:57:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:57:53):**  Nispero.  
**[0:57:54-0:57:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:57:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:55-0:57:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:57:55):**  Nispero.  
**[0:57:56-0:58:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:57:56):**  So you can make an alcohol from seed.  
**[0:58:02-0:58:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:58:02):**  The leaves are actually really good for respiratory diseases.  
**[0:58:07-0:58:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:58:07):**  Hint, hint.  
**[0:58:09-0:58:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:58:09):**  A leaf seed.  
**[0:58:10-0:58:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:58:10):**  It's incredibly medicinal.  
**[0:58:12-0:58:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:58:12):**  The fruit can be dried and preserved.  
**[0:58:16-0:58:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:58:16):**  It can be made into jam.  
**[0:58:18-0:58:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:58:18):**  You know, it's like, come on people, let's start thinking outside of the box here.  
**[0:58:23-0:58:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:58:23):**  And you don't really have to start thinking too hard.  
**[0:58:24-0:58:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:58:24):**  Oh, and those trees are so loaded too.  
**[0:58:26-0:58:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:58:26):**  It's not even like you get a couple off of a tree.  
**[0:58:31-0:58:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:58:31):**  I could go out there and feel like tubs worth just walking around my neighborhood.  
**[0:58:37-0:58:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:58:37):**  And pigs love them.  
**[0:58:39-0:58:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:58:39):**  Chickens love them.  
**[0:58:40-0:58:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:58:40):**  So it's really, these are the leverage points that we have to look for.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:58:46):**  And that's part of this observational exercise.  
**[0:58:50-0:58:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:58:50):**  And I feel like we've been very disempowered to observe our natural surroundings.  
**[0:58:58-0:59:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:58:58):**  Because we've been bombarded with information and flashy color things and technology takes  
**[0:59:08-0:59:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:59:08):**  our attention away.  
**[0:59:10-0:59:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:59:10):**  And it's like, it's like, de-trained our observational skills.  
**[0:59:16-0:59:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:59:16):**  So we need to retrain ourselves with protracted and thoughtful observation.  
**[0:59:26-0:59:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:59:26):**  Just walk around, check things out, see what works in your local climate.  
**[0:59:30-0:59:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:59:30):**  See what the elders like the grandpas and the great grandmas are having their garden.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:59:36):**  They're the wisdom carriers.  
**[0:59:39-0:59:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:59:39):**  And if there's intact, intact indigenous cultures in your area, go meet with them.  
**[0:59:44-0:59:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:59:44):**  Ask them, see what their food culture is.  
**[0:59:48-0:59:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:59:48):**  And that's how we can really adapt our food system to fit the local climate because it  
**[0:59:54-0:59:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:59:54):**  is context dependent.  
**[0:59:57-1:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=0:59:57):**  And we're such a, we've homogenized our food system to such a point where the food diversity,  
**[1:00:05-1:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:00:05):**  we're down from thousands and thousands of varieties of vegetable crops down to maybe  
**[1:00:10-1:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:00:10):**  several hundred, which still seems like a lot.  
**[1:00:13-1:00:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:00:13):**  But the diversity of seed stock that our grandparents had was like light years beyond what we're  
**[1:00:24-1:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:00:24):**  we have access to.  
**[1:00:25-1:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:00:25):**  And that was a real shame.  
**[1:00:27-1:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:00:27):**  And we can't really go back there.  
**[1:00:29-1:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:00:29):**  But with trees, luckily trees are so long lived that it's not, they haven't necessarily  
**[1:00:37-1:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:00:37):**  suffered such a decline as vegetable crops have, a decline in diversity.  
**[1:00:43-1:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:00:43):**  So they're still living, thriving in your area.  
**[1:00:48-1:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:00:48):**  And you can collect seed.  
**[1:00:50-1:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:00:50):**  You can take cuttings.  
**[1:00:51-1:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:00:51):**  You can propagate these trees in a small scale.  
**[1:00:56-1:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:00:56):**  You talked about starting your nursery.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:00:59):**  Again, YouTube is your friend.  
**[1:01:02-1:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:01:02):**  Let's use technology for its highest use is to learn how to propagate trees.  
**[1:01:08-1:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:01:08):**  And it's species dependent.  
**[1:01:11-1:01:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:01:11):**  Every species has its own specific propagation technique.  
**[1:01:15-1:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:01:15):**  And mulberry in particular, the reason I, one of the reasons I like it is because it's  
**[1:01:19-1:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:01:19):**  so easy to propagate from cutting.  
**[1:01:22-1:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:01:22):**  You just stick a stick in the ground in many cases.  
**[1:01:25-1:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:01:25):**  That's it.  
**[1:01:27-1:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:01:27):**  And it's elderberry around here is another one like that.  
**[1:01:31-1:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:01:31):**  You just stick a stick in the ground and it pops right back up.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:01:34):**  That's right.  
**[1:01:35-1:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:01:35):**  So vegetative propagation, asexual propagation, those are the technical terms, cloning.  
**[1:01:42-1:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:01:42):**  Those are all very possible with the more a seed, the figs and mulberries and in the  
**[1:01:48-1:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:01:48):**  tropics, the breadfruit and whatnot.  
**[1:01:51-1:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:01:51):**  Oh yeah, the figs were another one I did this year.  
**[1:01:54-1:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:01:54):**  And the rosacea, like you probably have lots of pomegranates, granata around you.  
**[1:01:59-1:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:01:59):**  I mean there's a city in Spain named after granados.  
**[1:02:04-1:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:02:04):**  Whether the city was named after the fruit or the fruit was named after the city, who  
**[1:02:09-1:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:02:09):**  knows.  
**[1:02:10-1:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:02:10):**  But they can be propagated by cutting or by seed.  
**[1:02:13-1:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:02:13):**  And a lot of people think, oh well, there's been this common misnomer really that trees  
**[1:02:21-1:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:02:21):**  don't come true to type or like you plant a fruit tree seed, you won't get a good fruit  
**[1:02:27-1:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:02:27):**  from it.  
**[1:02:28-1:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:02:28):**  That is true in the rare case.  
**[1:02:32-1:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:02:32):**  And that's the minority.  
**[1:02:34-1:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:02:34):**  The majority of trees, believe it or not, you can plant a seed.  
**[1:02:38-1:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:02:38):**  Like you could even take a seed from an apple, you get it in the store, plant it.  
**[1:02:42-1:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:02:42):**  And chances are you're going to get an edible apple off of it.  
**[1:02:45-1:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:02:45):**  You maybe even if it's got a crab apple off of it, well you can graft the top of it or  
**[1:02:50-1:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:02:50):**  you can make a hard cider, you know, or feed it to your pigs.  
**[1:02:54-1:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:02:54):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[1:02:55-1:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:02:55):**  There's no loss.  
**[1:02:56-1:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:02:56):**  Like worst case scenario, it's not what you were looking for, but it's never not useful  
**[1:02:59-1:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:02:59):**  to have planted that tree.  
**[1:03:02-1:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:03:02):**  That's right.  
**[1:03:03-1:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:03:03):**  You know, and they say that the best time to plant a tree was 10 years ago, the next  
**[1:03:06-1:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:03:06):**  last time is now.  
**[1:03:08-1:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:03:08):**  So you just start with what you have.  
**[1:03:12-1:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:03:12):**  And those resources are readily available to anyone.  
**[1:03:16-1:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:03:16):**  And you don't need to purchase a potting soil mix.  
**[1:03:19-1:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:03:19):**  You can use the soil that you have in your yard mixed with some compost that you can  
**[1:03:25-1:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:03:25):**  make very inexpensively.  
**[1:03:29-1:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:03:29):**  With so point being that you don't have to have a big budget to start a nursery to grow.  
**[1:03:36-1:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:03:36):**  And you could grow several hundred trees in a 10 square foot space, really, you know,  
**[1:03:45-1:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:03:45):**  to the point where they're ready to be planted into the ground.  
**[1:03:48-1:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:03:48):**  And you can use old water bottle, recycled water bottles, milk cartons, plastic bags  
**[1:03:54-1:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:03:54):**  for your pots.  
**[1:03:55-1:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:03:55):**  You know, you don't need to go out and buy materials to do this.  
**[1:03:59-1:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:03:59):**  So it's readily accessible to everyone.  
**[1:04:04-1:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:04:04):**  You know, it's non discriminatory, it is an equal opportunity for everyone to grow trees  
**[1:04:11-1:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:04:11):**  in their yard and plant them out.  
**[1:04:14-1:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:04:14):**  And it does take time, but it doesn't, before you know it, your trees will be fruiting.  
**[1:04:19-1:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:04:19):**  I mean, I'm looking at a loquat tree, we were talking about loquats that I planted from  
**[1:04:23-1:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:04:23):**  seed about 10 years ago, and it's about 15 feet tall, and it's loaded with fruit right  
**[1:04:29-1:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:04:29):**  now.  
**[1:04:30-1:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:04:30):**  So it's the long game, but that's the only game we really have.  
**[1:04:35-1:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:04:35):**  And it's the best game in town is the long game.  
**[1:04:38-1:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:04:38):**  And you have to because we're planting these trees, not only for us, but for our children.  
**[1:04:42-1:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:04:42):**  I have two kids.  
**[1:04:43-1:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:04:43):**  And there's nothing better, you know, no more satisfying feeling than to see my children  
**[1:04:48-1:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:04:48):**  go out and pick fruit off of the tree that I planted.  
**[1:04:53-1:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:04:53):**  And so that's really what we're, when you plant trees, you're really doing it for the  
**[1:04:58-1:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:04:58):**  future generations.  
**[1:04:59-1:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:04:59):**  Talk about leaving a legacy beyond like an inheritance or these other things with kind  
**[1:05:05-1:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:05:05):**  of finite or invented value.  
**[1:05:08-1:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:05:08):**  This is something that has value, not just for humans, but for every other form of life  
**[1:05:14-1:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:05:14):**  anywhere you would plant them.  
**[1:05:16-1:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:05:16):**  That's right.  
**[1:05:17-1:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:05:17):**  If anything, I would rather leave an orchard to my family than a million dollars.  
**[1:05:23-1:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:05:23):**  Because I mean, yeah, maybe with a million dollars, they can plant their own orchard,  
**[1:05:27-1:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:05:27):**  but  
**[1:05:28-1:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:05:28):**  they can't have planted it when you did.  
**[1:05:30-1:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:05:30):**  They can't go back in time.  
**[1:05:31-1:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:05:31):**  That's the big thing.  
**[1:05:32-1:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:05:32):**  That's right.  
**[1:05:33-1:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:05:33):**  That's right.  
**[1:05:34-1:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:05:34):**  So it is definitely that's the legacy that I want to leave to my family and my community  
**[1:05:42-1:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:05:42):**  is trees everywhere, wherever they'll grow.  
**[1:05:45-1:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:05:45):**  And and I'm not a native plant Nazi by any means.  
**[1:05:50-1:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:05:50):**  I think whatever works, whatever will grow, whatever will thrive, because we have such  
**[1:05:56-1:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:05:56):**  a, again, a myopic perspective on landscape where if there's an invasive plant, we want  
**[1:06:04-1:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:06:04):**  to eradicate it and reintroduce what was there prior.  
**[1:06:09-1:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:06:09):**  But if you just take a step back, that invasive plant and you look at it, it's providing a  
**[1:06:14-1:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:06:14):**  service and it will actually create the conditions for regeneration if you just allow it.  
**[1:06:20-1:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:06:20):**  If we just can stand back and let the system go through its evolution, it might be 100  
**[1:06:28-1:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:06:28):**  years, it might be 500 years.  
**[1:06:32-1:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:06:32):**  Eventually it's going to restabilize if we can just stop damaging it.  
**[1:06:35-1:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:06:35):**  If we can just stop intervening in a detrimental way, we need to learn how to intervene in  
**[1:06:43-1:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:06:43):**  a regenerative way where we're actually assisting the evolution of the system from a climax,  
**[1:06:50-1:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:06:50):**  or I should say from like a pioneer system, which is where most of the landscape and in  
**[1:06:58-1:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:06:58):**  modern culture is at, is it a pioneer that is a, you know, it's just had its disturbance  
**[1:07:05-1:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:07:05):**  to a climax ecosystem, which is an intact forest, savannah, grassland, whatever the  
**[1:07:14-1:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:07:14):**  context is.  
**[1:07:16-1:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:07:16):**  We need to rapidly transition more towards that climax ecosystem.  
**[1:07:21-1:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:07:21):**  So whatever we can do to assist the system to reach that point is really where we need  
**[1:07:27-1:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:07:27):**  to focus our energy, in my opinion.  
**[1:07:30-1:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:07:30):**  Very well said.  
**[1:07:31-1:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:07:31):**  And on that inspiring note, how about you tell our listeners a little bit about how  
**[1:07:35-1:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:07:35):**  they can get in touch with you, how they can find out more about your company and learn  
**[1:07:39-1:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:07:39):**  more about these topics in general.  
**[1:07:42-1:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:07:42):**  Great.  
**[1:07:43-1:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:07:43):**  Yeah, so my local company is called Santa Barbara Organics.  
**[1:07:48-1:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:07:48):**  I'm on the web at sborganics.com.  
**[1:07:52-1:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:07:52):**  People can send me a message there.  
**[1:07:53-1:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:07:53):**  I have a little gallery and that's like my residential and small farm management company  
**[1:08:00-1:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:08:00):**  where I do consulting and I do some tree plantings and pruning and for fruit trees and whatnot,  
**[1:08:08-1:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:08:08):**  orchard care.  
**[1:08:10-1:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:08:10):**  And then I have a design business that I started with some colleagues, Permaculture Design  
**[1:08:17-1:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:08:17):**  International.  
**[1:08:18-1:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:08:18):**  So that's permacultureintl.com.  
**[1:08:19-1:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:08:19):**  They can find me on there if it's more of an international project or a larger scale  
**[1:08:27-1:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:08:27):**  project.  
**[1:08:28-1:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:08:28):**  That's kind of the portal that I've been moving those projects through.  
**[1:08:33-1:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:08:33):**  And that's more of a collaborative design team where I pull in associates from local  
**[1:08:42-1:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:08:42):**  areas, sort of serve as a networker for people globally to really connect with the designers  
**[1:08:52-1:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:08:52):**  that are in their area.  
**[1:08:53-1:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:08:53):**  So those are two places people can find me is sborganics.com and permacultureintl.com.  
**[1:09:03-1:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:09:03):**  So yeah, I think that should be enough for people to reach out to me.  
**[1:09:10-1:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/loren-luyendyk/#t=1:09:10):**  Very exciting stuff.

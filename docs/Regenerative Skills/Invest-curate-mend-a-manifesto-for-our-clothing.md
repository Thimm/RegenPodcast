**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:00:00):**  You invest, you curate, and then you mend.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:00:09):**  And I think with those strategies in play, we could do so much to the bigger conversation  
**[0:00:16-0:00:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:00:16):**  around how much we're consuming, which is totally unsustainable.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:00:19):**  There's just no way we can continue what we're doing.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:00:23):**  It's got to shift.

**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:01:28):**  If you don't know her from her books, Fiber Shed and Harvesting Color, you'll likely  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:01:32):**  remember Rebecca Burgess from the panel discussion two weeks ago that I hosted with the team  
**[0:01:36-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:01:36):**  at Climate Farmers, in which she and Aroa Alvarez Fernandez spoke about the potential  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:01:42):**  of regenerative fashion and textiles to transform the current clothing industry.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:01:47):**  After that discussion, I felt compelled to speak to her again to explore some of the  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:01:51):**  options that are available to everyone to rediscover the value in our wardrobes and  
**[0:01:56-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:01:56):**  care for our clothing as investments.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:01:59):**  Now, this is no minor change.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:02:02):**  The fashion industry around the world is now second only to the oil industry as the largest  
**[0:02:06-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:02:06):**  polluter on earth.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:02:08):**  This affects everyone and is tied to many aspects of our lives, from growing fibers,  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:02:13):**  to processing fabrics and dyeing them, to the millions of people who work in the industry  
**[0:02:19-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:02:19):**  from farming all the way to retail.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:02:21):**  It's responsible for 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions due to its long supply chains  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:02:27):**  and energy intensive production, but even more severe is the industry's impact on  
**[0:02:32-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:02:32):**  our water supplies.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:02:34):**  For example, 85% of the daily needs in water of the entire population of India could be  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:02:39):**  covered by the water used just to grow cotton in the country.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:02:43):**  And yet it's estimated that 100 million people there do not have secure access to  
**[0:02:48-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:02:48):**  drinking water.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:02:50):**  Now in most of the countries in which garments are produced, untreated toxic waste waters  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:02:54):**  from textile factories are dumped directly into the rivers.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:02:58):**  The contamination eventually reaches the sea and then spreads around the globe.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:03:02):**  But while the destruction of the clothing industry is staggering, there are a lot of  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:03:06):**  simple things that all of us can change in our consumption and care habits to do our  
**[0:03:10-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:03:10):**  part to fix this.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:03:13):**  Since this is certainly not my own area of expertise, I asked Rebecca what her own hierarchy  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:03:18):**  of clothing purchases are and how she decides what garments to invest in.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:03:22):**  First of all, it's definitely based on need and not just a replication of something I  
**[0:03:30-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:03:30):**  already have.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:03:31):**  So there's that.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:03:33):**  And then, you know, I do have parameters in which I can't continuously afford the time  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:03:42):**  or the money to buy something that's completely handmade all the time.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:03:47):**  That's not like the life that I have.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:03:50):**  So I do have clothes that are handmade.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:03:53):**  There's a few keystone species in the wardrobe that are really beautiful.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:03:59):**  They're made from yarn from ranches who I love dearly.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:04:04):**  They're generally a little more unique garments that I don't wear all the time.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:04:11):**  I haven't really figured out how to make the local into like the most everyday item, except  
**[0:04:16-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:04:16):**  for the sweater, like it works for sweaters.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:04:19):**  But anything you need to wear on the lower half of your body, that drives me out into  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:04:24):**  the world writ large of, you know, where to find something I consider ethical or so I'm  
**[0:04:30-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:04:30):**  looking for some kind of triangulation between we're really supporting the US tax base because  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:04:38):**  I live here and I want to see a better social safety net.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:04:42):**  And I don't think we can do that under our current economic conditions where we're kind  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:04:46):**  of printing money, working off economic fumes.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:04:52):**  I really want to see a real economy.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:04:54):**  And so I always look for was this made in the US because I live here.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:04:58):**  I have a responsibility to this tax base and to the democratic process I'm trying to shape  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:05:04):**  and helping support US manufacturing is huge.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:05:08):**  If I can find it, it's not easy.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:05:10):**  I also look for just 100% natural fiber.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:05:14):**  So whatever that I look for pretty religiously, like did you put spandex in it?  
**[0:05:20-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:05:20):**  Polyester?  
**[0:05:21-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:05:21):**  If you did, I'm going to try to look for something else.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:05:24):**  Why is it that natural fibers are so important to healthy and positive clothing choices?  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:05:29):**  I thought that all these higher performance synthetic fabrics promise to last longer and  
**[0:05:34-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:05:34):**  be more durable, especially for outdoor wear.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:05:37):**  It's amazing to me that especially living in a county where a lot of people are outside  
**[0:05:44-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:05:44):**  and they're hiking around how much we're wearing fossilized carbon refined through very egregious  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:05:54):**  refinement processes that create a fluent in our water that's toxic air emissions that  
**[0:06:00-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:06:00):**  are toxic soil contamination.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:06:02):**  And then we use those refined fossilized carbon sources and we turn them into nurdles and  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:06:09):**  then we turn them into filaments and then we wear Patagonia fleece jackets and yeah,  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:06:15):**  they say they're recycled plastic bottles, but once it's a fleece, they can't go anywhere  
**[0:06:18-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:06:18):**  else.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:06:19):**  It's a dead end.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:06:20):**  It's called a sack.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:06:21):**  So we're out there enjoying nature while literally the dust from those clothes, the lint is a  
**[0:06:29-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:06:29):**  contaminant.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:06:30):**  Like you can't, it's not just your washing machine, it's not just your dryer.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:06:34):**  You're literally like a plastic dust storm walking outside with your plastic clothes  
**[0:06:39-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:06:39):**  and it gets in your food, it gets in your body.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:06:42):**  So we're drinking our yoga pants and all these things that people want stretch.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:06:48):**  They don't know.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:06:49):**  They don't know what all this is doing.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:06:50):**  They know what's happening in the soil, you know, with these plastic lint items getting  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:06:56):**  into microbes and changing the metabolic pathways of the soil microbiology and it's stunting  
**[0:07:01-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:07:01):**  plant life.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:07:03):**  It's a problem and these are the ways that we're starting to understand it's a problem.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:07:07):**  So we don't know how ubiquitous it is, I guess at this point, but I'm worried about those  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:07:12):**  things more so than my own body.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:07:15):**  I mean, I'm coming and going like I'm on this planet for a little bit of time, but my job  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:07:21):**  is to leave it cleaner than I left during my sojourn here and wearing plastic is not  
**[0:07:27-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:07:27):**  part of that recipe.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:07:29):**  Okay, yeah, that makes very clear sense.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:07:32):**  But so now that we've talked about buying clothes on a needs base primarily and working  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:07:36):**  to exclude plastic and fossil fuel based fibers from the wardrobe, that brings me to think  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:07:41):**  about how we can care for the items that we already own and mend them as they become worn  
**[0:07:46-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:07:46):**  down.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:07:47):**  Yes, it's it's the caring part is it.  
**[0:07:52-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:07:52):**  Well, I actually see it happening, you know, like the mending and the repair work has become  
**[0:08:00-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:08:00):**  visible.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:08:01):**  They couldn't call it visible mending where like when I first started this, you know,  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:08:06):**  trying to understand how I could be helpful in this whole textile system.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:08:11):**  Visible mending was very, you know, 2005 and seven that was those were the years I was  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:08:16):**  exploring what I should do.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:08:20):**  It wasn't really that prevalent.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:08:22):**  And now there's Instagram accounts with many tens of thousands of followers looking at  
**[0:08:28-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:08:28):**  how are you taking care of you mending your sweater?  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:08:31):**  How are you mending the crotch of your pants?  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:08:35):**  You know, what techniques are you are you using people writing little zines on how to  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:08:40):**  do it people having little get togethers on how to do it.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:08:44):**  And to me that's critical because if you know polyester and acrylic and nylon those fibers  
**[0:08:49-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:08:49):**  have artificially made the price of fast fashion or most textiles cheaper, right?  
**[0:08:55-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:08:55):**  They externalize the climate change costs and the microfiber fragmentation costs and  
**[0:09:03-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:09:03):**  we externalize the air water soil emissions.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:09:04):**  So the plastic the poly acrylic cotton blend from some fast fashion brand that gives you  
**[0:09:11-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:09:11):**  a 10 to $12 t-shirt.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:09:14):**  It's that cheap because it's not all cotton.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:09:18):**  Cotton by nature even with all the exploitation of the farm and the farm worker and the chemical  
**[0:09:23-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:09:23):**  industry it's still more expensive than poly than the plastics.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:09:31):**  So they need the plastics to keep the prices down.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:09:34):**  So when my thing is if we're going to spend more on clothes because we're committing to  
**[0:09:38-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:09:38):**  clothing that's going to biodegrade then we got to know that we're going to spend more  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:09:44):**  or we're going to make payments, right?  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:09:46):**  There's also these payment plans I've seen.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:09:50):**  We're going to keep our clothes in play and the way we're going to do that we're going  
**[0:09:54-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:09:54):**  to spend a little more and then care about them.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:09:56):**  And I think that mending and investing go well together.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:10:01):**  You invest in the right piece.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:10:04):**  You become more of this one company for objects.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:10:07):**  I think it's called does a really neat thing where they turn the word consumer into collector.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:10:13):**  Think of your clothing as a collection like a very refined collection of garments that  
**[0:10:20-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:10:20):**  you are curating like a collector would.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:10:23):**  And you know what your movement patterns are, your job requirements, your life, what it  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:10:31):**  expects of you and you design a wardrobe.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:10:34):**  You think through each piece as it applies to the use patterns you know you need to work  
**[0:10:39-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:10:39):**  through.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:10:40):**  I'm a runner.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:10:41):**  I'm a UPS driver.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:10:44):**  Will I get a uniform I guess?  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:10:47):**  Whatever it is that I'm doing, I'm sitting, I'm driving, I'm on the computer, I'm working  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:10:52):**  at my cashier at a grocery store, whatever, are you standing, sitting, all that comes  
**[0:10:57-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:10:57):**  into play and then you kind of curate from there.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:11:00):**  And if you curate with used garments, that's been harder for me because I don't, our thrift  
**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:11:06):**  stores have all been closed for a long time with COVID.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:11:09):**  But historically, thrifting is really another way to curate your wardrobe.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:11:15):**  And then again, you invest, you curate, and then you mend.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:11:20):**  And I think with those strategies in play, we could do so much to the bigger conversation  
**[0:11:27-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:11:27):**  around how much we're consuming, which is totally unsustainable.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:11:30):**  There's no way we can continue what we're doing.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:11:34):**  It's got to shift.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:11:36):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:11:37):**  And I really want to focus for a second on that portion that you mentioned on mending,  
**[0:11:41-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:11:41):**  because it was a very common skill set to be able to mend textiles in our culture very,  
**[0:11:47-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:11:47):**  very recently.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:11:48):**  My partner still knows how to work a sewing machine, but partly because she studied fashion  
**[0:11:52-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:11:52):**  design in university.  
**[0:11:54-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:11:54):**  But I remember taking basic sewing skills at middle school, at home economics.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:12:01):**  And I always wondered, like, there's a lot you can do with this, but then the classes  
**[0:12:04-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:12:04):**  just stopped.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:12:05):**  And I didn't, I was never really inspired to pursue it, partly because of the way that  
**[0:12:09-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:12:09):**  our culture looks at these types of professions for male roles as well.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:12:15):**  Yes, I don't.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:12:18):**  I think that the, this odd, it's like one of the oddities of how the women's liberation  
**[0:12:25-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:12:25):**  movement manifested probably in the West, was that somehow we felt like the historic  
**[0:12:32-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:12:32):**  way in which home economics was taught, which was mainly to support the female, I guess,  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:12:38):**  to enter into a domestic home life in an effective way.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:12:43):**  But when we decided that that wasn't where women were going to hang out all the time,  
**[0:12:48-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:12:48):**  which I think is great, obviously.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:12:50):**  I'm a big fan of the freedom to choose your career path.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:12:56):**  But however, I think we threw the baby out with the bathwater when it came to home economics  
**[0:13:00-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:13:00):**  because it was, it's, it's, it should be a genderless or whatever, you know, like there  
**[0:13:06-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:13:06):**  should be no definition about who that's good for.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:13:09):**  That's good for everybody.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:13:11):**  I don't know how to darn your socks, which means, you know, socks are pretty much the  
**[0:13:18-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:13:18):**  one thing on the human body that it's really hard to imagine now not putting plastic in  
**[0:13:24-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:13:24):**  the sock because think of it has to stretch around this appendage on our body that gets  
**[0:13:30-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:13:30):**  so much pressure.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:13:32):**  It's all of our physical body weight and the force of gravity upon this little tiny foot.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:13:37):**  And it just gets incredible wear and tear.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:13:39):**  So mending that probably was part of home economics.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:13:42):**  At one point, you put a little wooden darning tool in there and you stretch the hole over  
**[0:13:48-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:13:48):**  surface to put yarn in a darning needle and you start like weaving basically you could  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:13:55):**  do the over under patterns vertically and horizontally on that hole and then off it  
**[0:14:00-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:14:00):**  comes from its darning tool and then back on your foot.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:14:06):**  We've used so much plastic in the socks that we don't darn and then when the socks finally  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:14:12):**  do wear out, which is normally all the natural fibers like threadbare and you just see these  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:14:16):**  little plastic filaments left on the hole.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:14:21):**  We're ready for the next pair.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:14:23):**  Let's get thrown away.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:14:25):**  And you know, the problem with all that plastic to though is it goes into the landfill because  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:14:30):**  socks people do I think probably end up throwing them away.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:14:34):**  I don't know a lot of people who are composting their socks because they can't.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:14:39):**  I think it's in our landfill and it releases antimony trioxide when it's in under heat  
**[0:14:45-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:14:45):**  conditions that plastic does create a huge problem in landfill because it's not supposed  
**[0:14:52-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:14:52):**  to they use antimony trioxide to make those filaments and they're generally not released  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:14:59):**  that chemicals not released until the sock or whatever it is that's plastic ends up in  
**[0:15:04-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:15:04):**  a warm or heated environment.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:15:06):**  So anaerobic landfill can create a pretty warm environment and so antimony trioxide  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:15:13):**  becomes one of these major leaching chemicals in our landfills and it's very detrimental  
**[0:15:19-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:15:19):**  to the human I'm going to say nervous system.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:15:22):**  I have a whole list of things it's bad for but that's that's something that also with  
**[0:15:26-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:15:26):**  mending it's like just keep this stuff out of landfill if we can.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:15:34):**  Socks we got a long way to go on I realized.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:15:38):**  Yeah undoubtedly socks might be a bit of a challenge moving forward.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:15:42):**  But so let's explore some of the options available for keeping garments in good condition and  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:15:47):**  good use for as long as possible by also keeping them circulating within our communities.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:15:53):**  Now you said back in the panel discussion that clothing swaps are one of your favorite  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:15:56):**  ways to do this.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:15:57):**  Can you give me a better idea of what a clothing swap is?  
**[0:16:01-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:16:01):**  Nice clothing swaps are often designed around a potluck.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:16:08):**  So if you you have clothing in your wardrobe that maybe you're just not wearing because  
**[0:16:14-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:16:14):**  it's lost some novelty or it's not the right shape for how your body has gotten bigger  
**[0:16:21-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:16:21):**  or smaller or whatever.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:16:24):**  You kind of can bundle those still very wearable items and and you know you can either be the  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:16:32):**  host or you can go to something that's being hosted but generally it's someone's living  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:16:36):**  room and you bring a dish of food and you bring your still very wearable interesting  
**[0:16:42-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:16:42):**  textile items in a bag and you generally have a meal and some drinks together and socialize  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:16:49):**  and then in the clothing swaps I've been at we just form a circle and we put all the clothes  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:16:54):**  in between us and we lay them out on the rug or hardwood floor whatever and just show what  
**[0:17:00-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:17:00):**  we have and then organically there's no more process really that I would say there's no  
**[0:17:06-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:17:06):**  protocol left you just kind of walk around and pick up things that you like.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:17:13):**  And you know you tend to it brings out like all of the I would say the desire to be polite  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:17:19):**  you don't want to grab more than you're bringing you want to bring nice things so if you trade  
**[0:17:24-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:17:24):**  your it's not a one-to-one trade necessarily between the person that you're absorbing the  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:17:31):**  new item from they may not want what you have but they may want what someone else has.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:17:36):**  So it's food it's sharing it's you know a delicate dance of bringing the right thing  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:17:42):**  and making sure you're not taking too much.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:17:46):**  I think traditional gifting circles have really nice formality these are a little looser in  
**[0:17:54-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:17:54):**  nature but yeah I think anyone can have a clothing swap hopefully we can institute these  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:18:00):**  more and more as as the world starts to socialize again.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:18:05):**  Yes I'm looking forward to that too that would be a good reason to get back together again  
**[0:18:09-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:18:09):**  yeah.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:18:10):**  It would.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:18:11):**  I can imagine that people have either grown out of or shrunk out of a lot of their clothes  
**[0:18:15-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:18:15):**  in this pandemic.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:18:16):**  So true I think yeah people's bodies have really changed size.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:18:20):**  Yeah you're right there should be a flood of post-covid clothing swaps.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:18:27):**  Definitely and so I've been to both the ones that you mentioned like in the small scale  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:18:31):**  like in someone's living room I've also been to ones at churches back when I was younger  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:18:37):**  and here in Spain they've actually they I mean they haven't done it in a while of course  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:18:42):**  because of covid but they used to do I think it was like once or twice a year they would  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:18:46):**  do clothing swaps within the entire town and set it up like an outdoor market where people  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:18:50):**  would have their tables and such and those were big events.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:18:54):**  That's amazing that sounds inspiring to do it at the community level wow.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:19:00):**  Yeah I've seen some big ones and some that were organized by schools so all the parents  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:19:05):**  would get together and swap kids clothes which god knows they are always growing out of those  
**[0:19:10-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:19:10):**  things.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:19:11):**  Yeah that's a high need a lot of turnover in kids clothes for sure.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:19:17):**  Oh my goodness I love that vision I have not seen a community scale version but churches,  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:19:24):**  schools, parking lots they yeah those are great locations if you have a community center  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:19:29):**  it seems like in your town that'd be a really fun thing to organize at a facility like that  
**[0:19:35-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:19:35):**  love it.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:19:36):**  One thing that I've noticed since I've moved here to Spain and kind of have been adopted  
**[0:19:39-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:19:39):**  into a new family is I'm the oldest of five kids in my family which means I got all the  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:19:45):**  new stuff and all of my younger siblings got all the hand-me-downs so I'm not used to getting  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:19:50):**  old stuff except for like when I go to thrift stores or buy things used which I normally  
**[0:19:54-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:19:54):**  do but since I moved here my parents folks had an entire wardrobe of a lot of clothing  
**[0:20:02-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:20:02):**  that my partner's grandfather used to wear which by some miracle fits me quite well and  
**[0:20:11-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:20:11):**  so now I wear a lot of grandfather clothes from an old Andalusian man who I never got  
**[0:20:17-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:20:17):**  to meet but it I've definitely had moments with my partner where she has looked at something  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:20:23):**  that I've put on or like came upstairs wearing and has broken into tears because of all of  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:20:28):**  the memories that come back to her from her grandfather and she likes seeing me kind of  
**[0:20:32-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:20:32):**  embrace this identity of a person that I didn't met but was extremely close to her and that's  
**[0:20:38-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:20:38):**  just one of the things that kind of made me think about all of these stories that are  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:20:42):**  continued from memories that come through clothing. Have you had similar experiences?  
**[0:20:47-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:20:47):**  Yes and I love that. I love that story so much and just out of curiosity he must have  
**[0:20:55-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:20:55):**  a lot of nice natural fiber clothes I'm imagining. Yeah definitely more than like I would find  
**[0:21:02-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:21:02):**  in a store and he worked as like a car mechanic and he loved to work in their garden so you  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:21:09):**  get a lot of like sweaters that have been well worn in the elbows and you know like  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:21:15):**  you said that those patterns of wear and the evidence of use and their intention when they  
**[0:21:20-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:21:20):**  were when they were in use is something that I really like to notice like some of them  
**[0:21:24-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:21:24):**  have paint stains because you would do a lot of maintenance on the house and things like  
**[0:21:29-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:21:29):**  that and I wear that kind of stuff proudly like it's a badge.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:21:32):**  Nice it is I mean it's someone actually doing their own work in their own environment and  
**[0:21:39-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:21:39):**  it's connected yeah to the shelter and the community and wow it's yeah definitely woven  
**[0:21:46-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:21:46):**  and stitched in a bunch of experiences into that one paint stain that's very cool. It's  
**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:21:52):**  true our clothes I mean I don't think you've ever been through someone's closet who's deceased  
**[0:21:58-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:21:58):**  I think that becomes a really prominent moment where you recognize how laden the textile  
**[0:22:04-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:22:04):**  is with memory because you can think through when you saw that person alive wearing that  
**[0:22:10-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:22:10):**  shirt I mean that's when it's really been extremely poignant to me it's like posthumously  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:22:16):**  I'm like whoa these clothes are such an emblem more of an emblem than any other object of  
**[0:22:21-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:22:21):**  this person's lived experience you know how they wore the clothes the elbows the knees.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:22:27):**  My dad's wardrobe after he passed was such an incredible way of continuing his life the  
**[0:22:37-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:22:37):**  stories that were generated during his wear cycle and then mine because I wore a lot of  
**[0:22:43-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:22:43):**  his clothes they were wonderful they were very hand embroidered all very mended a lot  
**[0:22:50-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:22:50):**  of corduroy from the 70s and 60s yeah so I think I think that it's a way to yeah express  
**[0:23:02-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:23:02):**  our lives in a way if we have a clothing shop we can say well I wore that when I did this  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:23:08):**  now you get to experience it but that also that's a really good point that is part of  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:23:13):**  how we can share the clothes we can share the item and the stories that go with it yeah  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:23:18):**  it's a nice way to share ourselves in our lives with others.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:23:23):**  Okay but so there's one more key part to this idea of clothing swaps and I wouldn't know  
**[0:23:27-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:23:27):**  where to start in organizing one can you tell me about how to get one of these things started?  
**[0:23:34-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:23:34):**  Well I've organized a few I've also just been you know an audience or a participant in someone  
**[0:23:43-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:23:43):**  else's hosted clothing swap and what I observed was an invitation to or what I participated  
**[0:23:53-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:23:53):**  in as a hostess maybe an invitation to five to ten people we've done it a pretty you know  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:23:58):**  whoever can fit in your living room I guess it depends on how big if if you're doing it  
**[0:24:03-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:24:03):**  in the evening and it's cool and yeah you want to fit in indoors you kind of host depending  
**[0:24:09-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:24:09):**  on the size of the space and that you have available and then you would set a time where  
**[0:24:15-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:24:15):**  you have enough time to eat together and socialize together as a first things first you definitely  
**[0:24:22-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:24:22):**  want to have a place in the house where people can go and try things on so knowing that if  
**[0:24:28-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:24:28):**  you're inviting people over it might be the use of your living room and the bathroom or  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:24:33):**  another bedroom because trying things on is a big fun part of it people try on each other's  
**[0:24:38-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:24:38):**  clothes and come out and show people and generally it's been a group of women I have been involved  
**[0:24:46-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:24:46):**  primarily in lady focused clothing swaps and it's just like having this is a chit chat  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:24:54):**  level is hilarious you can barely follow one conversation for more than maybe 30 seconds  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:24:59):**  before something else starts up and then then you're off to the next thing and then someone  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:25:05):**  walks out with someone's old sweater and it looks amazing on them and everyone compliments  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:25:10):**  that person profusely about how good they look and then they take that sweater home  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:25:15):**  but I think what you're doing in a way is you're building each other up in a thoughtful  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:25:21):**  and authentic way you're supporting each other in acquiring a new piece but you're also saying

**[0:26:57-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/invest-curate-mend-a-manifesto-for-our-clothing/#t=0:26:57):**  buy less things but it also means that more of your money stays in the community instead

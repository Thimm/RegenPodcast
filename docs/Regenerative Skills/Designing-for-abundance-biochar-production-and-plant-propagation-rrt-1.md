**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:01:22):**  and the whole abundant edge team gets together, usually in the evening, seen as this is what  
**[0:01:26-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:01:26):**  we do anyway.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:01:28):**  And we have one of the conversations that we usually get into in the evenings talking

**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:01:55):**  interviewed on the podcast in their own episodes, which they refer to as soon as I asked them  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:02:00):**  to introduce themselves.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:02:01):**  So you can always check those out in the archives from the show.

**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:02:31):**  us a private message or post on the page itself.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:02:34):**  So instead of doing one of the longer, more drawn out introductions that I tend to do  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:02:38):**  for the regular interviews, I'm going to let the boys take it away and bear with us a little  
**[0:02:43-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:02:43):**  bit.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:02:44):**  This is the first time that we're trying to actually record one of these nutty conversations  
**[0:02:47-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:02:47):**  that we normally have.

**[0:02:52-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:02:52):**  towards the end.

**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:04:02):**  shed that me and Jeremy built in like two days.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:04:07):**  And we made that into like a little bedroom tool shed, which is actually a great thing  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:04:12):**  to do for anyone who's like thinking of getting land because it lets you be on the land all  
**[0:04:16-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:04:16):**  the time, live super free, kind of connect with the land.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:04:19):**  So we're here outside our little metal bodega and that's where I've been living these last  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:04:24):**  couple of months and we'll be living until the house is built.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:04:28):**  We're drinking our jocote wine.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:04:33):**  Yeah.

**[0:04:44-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:04:44):**  But here and now I've moved into Zununá along with the boys here.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:04:53):**  Before that I was traveling around a bit and working.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:04:56):**  I have a bus that a couple of friends and I bought and converted that we had been living  
**[0:05:03-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:05:03):**  in because I didn't have a piece of land.

**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:05:08):**  Even now it is because I'm living in it just across the street from our land next to the  
**[0:05:13-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:05:13):**  bodega so that once again we can be on the land in a spot but not have to make any permanent  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:05:20):**  structural decisions like immediately.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:05:23):**  So there's no stress on that.

**[0:05:54-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:05:54):**  weeks since the apprenticeship started.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:05:56):**  Okay so I came into this situation with a decent kind of portfolio and understanding  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:06:04):**  of earthworks and water systems.

**[0:06:29-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:06:29):**  If people have heard of the scale of permaculture it's this sort of like designer decision-making  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:06:36):**  checklist that you go through to look at.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:06:39):**  One of the things that you should really be focusing on immediately due to not only how  
**[0:06:44-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:06:44):**  important they are to the subsequent elements but also how permanent they are in the design  
**[0:06:52-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:06:52):**  itself and in the ecosystem around them.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:06:54):**  And it starts with climate and of course that was something that we looked into heavily.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:07:00):**  We've been living here for a bit, been trying to figure out, yeah I mean for five or six  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:07:06):**  years Neil and I.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:07:09):**  So climate is super important.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:07:11):**  It tells us what species we should be focusing on.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:07:13):**  It tells us what time of year we should be doing certain things.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:07:17):**  It's a wet season, dry season climate here in that in the summer months there's quite  
**[0:07:23-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:07:23):**  a lot of rain.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:07:24):**  It's not a good time to build.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:07:26):**  It's a great time to put perennial species in the ground and work with those.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:07:31):**  So we have a whole strategy based around that.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:07:34):**  Neil will talk a bit about that.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:07:36):**  That's something that he's focused on is our planting strategy this coming year.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:07:40):**  But with this dry season that we're in now during the winter and spring months it's very  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:07:44):**  important that we focus on earthworks and construction.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:07:48):**  So when we go down the scale of permanence it moves into landform.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:07:54):**  Landform is very permanent.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:07:56):**  It's things that you can't change about the landscape.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:07:59):**  But it's something that you can embellish or work with to make sure that other aspects  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:08:05):**  of the landscape function properly, i.e. water.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:08:10):**  So that's something that I've been very focused on in my design work.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:08:13):**  And here on the property you start with the landform, you look at what your soil is made  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:08:17):**  of, you determine what it can be most useful for.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:08:21):**  We have a lot of rocks.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:08:23):**  It's like a washout kind of area.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:08:25):**  This is what we call like alluvial soils.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:08:27):**  They've been washed in by infrequent storms and flooding.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:08:33):**  So we look at that soil profile and we find that it's very rocky but the actual composition  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:08:39):**  of the soil is great for growing crops if you can get the rocks out.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:08:43):**  So it makes a lot of sense for us to construct as much as we can with the rocks and the soil  
**[0:08:49-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:08:49):**  and thus freeing up nice loose arable land for growing crops.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:08:58):**  And so we start at the top of the property.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:09:00):**  This is a very important thing to look at.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:09:04):**  When it comes to water, which is the next component on the list or element, storing  
**[0:09:10-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:09:10):**  it nice and high on the property is a great place to start in any situation.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:09:13):**  And that's basically what I'm doing right now or focusing my design work on, is catching  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:09:20):**  water at the top of the property, assessing that water, seeing what it is.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:09:24):**  And for us, river water is a great sector flow for water for us.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:09:30):**  It's slightly polluted and quite misused.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:09:37):**  And for us, bringing it onto land is not like something that we look at as damaging to the  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:09:43):**  landscape.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:09:44):**  We can take that water, we can clean it, we can work it into the ecosystem, we can charge  
**[0:09:50-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:09:50):**  the water table around us with this water and produce really abundant diversity of perennial  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:09:59):**  crops that we use for many different things.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:10:01):**  And everyone below us, of course, as well.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:10:04):**  This water just keeps flowing.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:10:06):**  It charges the ground table, it starts to flow at a certain point below our property  
**[0:10:11-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:10:11):**  and it can mean a lot of opportunities in the future.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:10:13):**  So catching this water, which is quite abundant, we get...  
**[0:10:21-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:10:21):**  I actually haven't done the measurements yet, but we have somewhere between 3,000 to 4,000  
**[0:10:28-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:10:28):**  years a day flowing on the land as we speak.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:10:31):**  So that kind of flow of water could actually be quite a problem if you're not using it  
**[0:10:37-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:10:37):**  properly.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:10:38):**  You can wash nutrients out of the soil, it can damage the structures that we have around  
**[0:10:43-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:10:43):**  us.

**[0:10:50-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:10:50):**  together means that we can grow an amazing abundance of food and fodder and fibers, all  
**[0:10:59-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:10:59):**  the Fs that we talk about with our systems that we create.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:11:05):**  Taking that water and creating aquatic ecosystems with it is very important.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:11:11):**  It's an abundance of food, it creates amazing habitat for wild species, and basically it  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:11:17):**  sequesters more carbon than any other kind of technique we can use here.

**[0:11:27-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:11:27):**  to flow slowly and around the landscape, and combining that with sunlight, it's important  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:11:33):**  that we bring this water out from sort of cracks and crevices where it is on the property,  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:11:38):**  and pulling it into the sunnier regions, thus heating up the water, giving more opportunities

**[0:12:54-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:12:54):**  Excellent yeah, those water systems are coming along really well.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:12:57):**  So Neil can you elaborate on some of the things that Jeremy talked about and give us an overview  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:13:02):**  of the projects and implementations that you've been working on over the last week, or three  
**[0:13:08-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:13:08):**  weeks?  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:13:10):**  Yeah that was cool, thanks Jeremy.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:13:15):**  That's actually really great stuff to understand what Jeremy was talking about there.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:13:20):**  Because I remember when I came to Sununah first and met Shad in Athlete Land Organics  
**[0:13:24-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:13:24):**  and saw hoses running onto his land into ponds and swales from the river.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:13:31):**  I was actually kind of new to permaculture at the time and even though I understood it  
**[0:13:36-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:13:36):**  I was like, part of me was like, is that cool that he has river, he's siphoning off the  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:13:42):**  river onto his land?  
**[0:13:45-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:13:45):**  But actually Shad himself explains it really well in the classes.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:13:49):**  He says that when he started looking at it first and he realised eventually that if everyone  
**[0:13:55-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:13:55):**  in Sununah had hoses running into swales and ponds on their land and were moving it sideways,  
**[0:14:03-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:14:03):**  that initially the river would go down but eventually it would actually come way back  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:14:07):**  up and widen out and you'd get springs of water popping up in other places and you'd  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:14:12):**  basically get the effect of the valley kind of shallowing out.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:14:16):**  And you know it's like that idea that you first maybe don't understand about abundance  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:14:21):**  but it's like, water will create more water if you let it.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:14:26):**  Like it will turn itself into plants and those plants will suck in cloud moisture and like  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:14:32):**  suck in evaporation from the lake and deposit it into the ground.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:14:37):**  So it's like a beautiful thing to see here and we're like super lucky to have all that  
**[0:14:43-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:14:43):**  water.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:14:44):**  And then Jeremy was talking about the scale of permanence and that's cool because after  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:14:49):**  like the climate and the landform of the water, one of the things that I'll be looking at  
**[0:14:55-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:14:55):**  are plant species and access.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:15:01):**  And like Jeremy said, we're fortunate that we've all worked here for like probably a  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:15:09):**  combined total of about 13 years.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:15:13):**  So you know we're going to start planning, or we are at the moment planning like what  
**[0:15:18-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:15:18):**  species we're going to put into the ground.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:15:20):**  So one thing I'm excited to do is, I was just talking to Nicolas, Shad's farm manager, and  
**[0:15:27-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:15:27):**  he's getting me like, he knows where a lot of the best, you know what they call Criollo  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:15:33):**  or heirloom avocados in the valley are because this is like very close to the center of origin  
**[0:15:38-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:15:38):**  of avocados.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:15:40):**  And there's a lot of amazing like Criollo varieties here but they're actually dying out because  
**[0:15:46-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:15:46):**  everybody is just propagating, hass, asexually over and over again.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:15:52):**  And the Criollo's they're usually really big over story trees that are just using shade  
**[0:15:59-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:15:59):**  and coffee but they tend not to be pruned and soil is degrading here.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:16:05):**  And a lot of them are just kind of dying out and then people go like, oh, the only avocado  
**[0:16:10-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:16:10):**  that's actually valuable to grow is hass.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:16:13):**  So they like, they take their, the seeds from these nice big Criollo's that they have and  
**[0:16:17-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:16:17):**  they graft hass avocados onto them.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:16:20):**  So it's actually just the gene pool is degenerating, you know, so I'm actually like super excited  
**[0:16:25-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:16:25):**  to make, I think avocados like the star kind of perennial crop here, apart from like Malanga  
**[0:16:32-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:16:32):**  and Tumorac and Ginger and all those kinds of root crops.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:16:35):**  But like we're in a nice region for growing avocados and we have water all year.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:16:40):**  So if we find a bunch of different Criollo's that do well here and we graft them, we'll  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:16:48):**  have, we could have avocados fruiting all year, you know, at different times, which  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:16:52):**  is the other great advantage of home setting as opposed to commercial farming.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:16:57):**  So I'm like super excited to work on that.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:17:01):**  There's a guy Manuel up the road and he's, he runs a nursery and he's like a ninja at  
**[0:17:07-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:17:07):**  grafting.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:17:08):**  So I'm actually looking forward to learning some grafting techniques from him.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:17:14):**  So yeah, I'm involved in that and what else like projects around the volunteers and the  
**[0:17:21-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:17:21):**  apprentices are here.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:17:24):**  It's great, you know.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:17:27):**  I feel like I'm learning so much myself at the moment.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:17:33):**  Like I don't like in the classes that I teach or on these podcasts or anything, I don't  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:17:38):**  like to present myself as an expert in anything.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:17:42):**  I'm not at all really my family are dairy farmers, but I was a long way from that actually  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:17:47):**  for a lot of time I was growing up.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:17:52):**  And I did a lot of like gardening and landscaping, but I really only made my way into permaculture  
**[0:17:58-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:17:58):**  late.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:18:01):**  And you know, it's, so I'm still on like a very steep learning curve myself, but I feel  
**[0:18:06-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:18:06):**  like with the combined experience that we have, you know, all three of us have really  
**[0:18:12-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:18:12):**  distilled down our crafts and we're like, we're able to teach stuff that it took us  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:18:17):**  all years to figure out in like a very short space of time.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:18:22):**  So I think we've got like a fun setup going here at the moment.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:18:26):**  You know, people are just coming up every day.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:18:28):**  Everyone's super motivated.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:18:29):**  We've got what, four interns?  
**[0:18:31-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:18:31):**  Five.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:18:32):**  Five interns.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:18:33):**  A couple of them are just taking the other four.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:18:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:18:38):**  And man, there's so much going on then because we're running a shad in Ahtidlan Organics  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:18:43):**  is running a social permaculture course this week.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:18:47):**  So he invited me to sit in on that.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:18:51):**  So that's super fun as well.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:18:53):**  Because I will say this actually, like in with regards to what Jeremy says, like there's,  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:18:58):**  I think there's a good reason Dharan Dharati includes social relations or, or, or, you  
**[0:19:04-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:19:04):**  know, invisible structures above climate in, in the decision making process, because it's  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:19:10):**  actually like, it's so, it's so important, you know.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:19:15):**  So it's like super fun to be learning about that and like in the role very much of a student  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:19:21):**  again.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:19:22):**  So yeah, I don't know what that's going on plus a bunch of other stuff I can't even remember.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:19:28):**  Yeah, that's a good way to sum it up.

**[0:19:36-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:19:36):**  What is it the 20th of February today?  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:19:39):**  So just a couple of days ago, we wrapped up another introduction to natural building course  
**[0:19:44-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:19:44):**  and we really packed this one.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:19:46):**  I've never had a group quite that large and both Neil and Jeremy assisted on the course.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:19:51):**  We got to try out some new things that normally we don't get to because the groups are well,  
**[0:19:57-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:19:57):**  are what we designed the course for.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:19:59):**  But we just had so many people sign up and also the apprentices were there as well.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:20:04):**  So we got to test out a batch box rocket configuration for a stove and oven combo.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:20:11):**  That was pretty fun.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:20:12):**  I've never actually built batch box rockets before and it seemed like a good time to test  
**[0:20:17-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:20:17):**  it out.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:20:18):**  So far they're working really well.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:20:20):**  A lot of little tweaks to be made and hopefully once I get the system dialed in, I'll be able  
**[0:20:25-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:20:25):**  to publish a manual.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:20:27):**  So if anybody's interested in building something similar, they can get the plans online for  
**[0:20:32-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:20:32):**  free.

**[0:20:41-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:20:41):**  program.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:20:42):**  And like Neil mentioned a second ago, we've got five apprentices for the next three months  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:20:48):**  and the big push is to get the main house built.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:20:53):**  There are a lot of aspects to the design of this structure, most of which we're considering  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:20:58):**  the very limited budget that we have in this season while we're trying to get so many essential  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:21:03):**  parts of the homestead dialed in and started so that we can take advantage of the rainy  
**[0:21:08-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:21:08):**  season to come and all of the potential for growth and maturation of the perennial systems  
**[0:21:15-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:21:15):**  in that season.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:21:17):**  But we also have to make the best use of what we have as Jeremy mentioned, putting our priorities  
**[0:21:22-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:21:22):**  and what we can accomplish best in this dry season because we have really nice dry weather,  
**[0:21:29-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:21:29):**  sunny days that aren't too hot and they're just perfect for getting a lot of earthworks  
**[0:21:33-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:21:33):**  and a lot of building done.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:21:35):**  So we actually have some professional Guatemalan bamboo settles or bamboo workers who are coming  
**[0:21:41-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:21:41):**  tomorrow and they're going to be helping to teach the apprentices and myself, quite frankly,  
**[0:21:48-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:21:48):**  how to frame with bamboo because the plans that we have for this house call for bamboo  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:21:55):**  support posts and roofing systems and we're also going to incorporate Bahareke or wattle  
**[0:22:00-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:22:00):**  and daub wall systems to be the infill in between the bamboo posts.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:22:06):**  We're also going to be using some locally harvest wood in the flooring and in the framing  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:22:14):**  and it's quite a simple and essential build for this season, taking care of all of our  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:22:19):**  needs first, but we've already planned on a lot of extensions as our resources grow  
**[0:22:24-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:22:24):**  and we have more to invest in the infrastructure of our land.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:22:27):**  So it's a really great learning opportunity for the apprentices, but also we'll be posting  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:22:32):**  videos and articles and other things on the website as soon as possible.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:22:37):**  It's just a matter of taking the time to process it so that all of you can learn from our process  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:22:44):**  and our planning stages as well.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:22:48):**  In the meantime, there are other courses coming up in the next few months where actually,  
**[0:22:57-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:22:57):**  let me give you back over to Neil for a second because he's going to explain a little more  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:23:01):**  about the animal house, which is a nice kind of segue from the building that we're talking  
**[0:23:05-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:23:05):**  about and going back into some of the land projects.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:23:08):**  Yeah, that's another super exciting thing that we're about to get working on now is  
**[0:23:13-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:23:13):**  that our animal and fertility system, because as Jeremy schemes away on the earthworks and  
**[0:23:21-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:23:21):**  the way water moves through the property, really the whole model is to build fertility  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:23:27):**  fast, to have all that alluvial soil deposited onto our land, to grow a lot of vegetation  
**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:23:33):**  that we can cut back or feed to animals or use as bedding for animals, because that's  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:23:38):**  really a big part of this model is generating a lot of organic matter and processing it  
**[0:23:43-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:23:43):**  quick and feeding ourselves.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:23:45):**  We've got a nice space not too far from the house on a little downward slope.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:23:50):**  The plan is to put in a goat house because Shad is very generously lending us his goats  
**[0:23:57-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:23:57):**  for the next year or so.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:24:00):**  I've managed those goats before.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:24:01):**  I love them.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:24:02):**  They're great animals and they're perfect for this climate.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:24:05):**  You can graze them.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:24:06):**  It effectively extends how big the land feels because you can graze them on what they call  
**[0:24:14-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:24:14):**  monte, bushy, weedy material that just grows all over the valley.

**[0:24:27-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:24:27):**  That's pretty sweet, but the idea is to combine them with poultry.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:24:33):**  We're going to build a little house for the goats on the top of the slope.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:24:36):**  Then we're going to have it fold down into or share a wall with a chicken house, which  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:24:43):**  will have the chickens in a sealed off area, but with a couple of swales going along to

**[0:24:53-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:24:53):**  Estiercol, manure, which will mix, like I say, with the straw that we get in for the

**[0:25:04-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:25:04):**  It's like a fun system to design because really for me, I see any successful farm, what it

**[0:26:01-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:26:01):**  I'm super excited to design that system.

**[0:29:36-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:29:36):**  So if this water rushes down there, we can put together immediately some non-living diversion  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:29:43):**  and prevention tactics.

**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:29:54):**  It was the first thing we did after flattening the area was, alright, let's put this in.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:29:59):**  Let's dig a large swale about a meter wide, 75 centimeters deep.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:30:06):**  Getting along the backside and sort of kicking out to one side.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:30:09):**  We just ran along the back edge kicking out to one side.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:30:13):**  We didn't have to run the whole thing.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:30:14):**  It's not necessary because we know where the water's coming from.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:30:17):**  We just got to tell it where to go.

**[0:30:23-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:30:23):**  This soil is luckily very free draining for the most part.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:30:27):**  It's got a bit of clay in it, but it works quite well for drainage.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:30:30):**  So as long as we can bury that water a bit below the floor plan for the house by grabbing  
**[0:30:37-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:30:37):**  it before it even flows onto the flat terrace area, we're winning.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:30:43):**  So we take that, we dig it out, we throw in loads of rocks because we have so many.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:30:47):**  But before doing that, we put a layer of geotextile fabric in there.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:30:52):**  The geotextile fabric holds the rocks in place in there, stops soil sediment from filling

**[0:31:16-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:31:16):**  We call it a French drain as well.

**[0:33:39-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:33:39):**  Running bamboo on the north side as a sun trap.

**[0:34:59-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:34:59):**  at least here in Central America.

**[0:38:38-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:38:38):**  what you see as being the potential for education and propagating these types of models all  
**[0:38:45-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:38:45):**  around the world because obviously there are a ton of factors that are unique to our site,  
**[0:38:49-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:38:49):**  but there is a general model of abundance and affordable regeneration that can be applied  
**[0:38:56-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:38:56):**  with the necessary tweaks for climate and situation pretty much anywhere in the world,  
**[0:39:01-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:39:01):**  right?  
**[0:39:02-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:39:02):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:39:06):**  I guess the idea with a lot of these courses that we put on is to, as Neil said, distill  
**[0:39:10-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:39:10):**  down what we know and what we are excited about or passionate about or inspired by nature  
**[0:39:17-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:39:17):**  and the people around us about and simplify it, reduce it down to its core concepts, right?  
**[0:39:24-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:39:24):**  That's where you start.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:39:26):**  And coincidentally, it's the same place where we can change our framework work about the  
**[0:39:30-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:39:30):**  world around us as well.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:39:31):**  And I'm not going to give away too much about our courses, but you know, they change the  
**[0:39:40-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:39:40):**  way you look at the entire world.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:39:41):**  And it's not, it goes beyond words really.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:39:45):**  I oftentimes don't have the right words to put in place to explain what it feels like  
**[0:39:51-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:39:51):**  to be like communing with nature in this way.  
**[0:39:55-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:39:55):**  And not to sound hippie with it, but like, yeah, basically seeing everything else grow  
**[0:40:02-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:40:02):**  around you as you grow and the people around you as well and like seeing how community  
**[0:40:08-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:40:08):**  develops around you and being a part of it.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:40:12):**  Community is a tough one for me to explain how that works, because it's really an emergent  
**[0:40:16-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:40:16):**  property of all the things we're doing.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:40:19):**  As Neil said, like try to enjoy your life.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:40:22):**  And usually to do that means like benefit most other things around you.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:40:28):**  When you really start to understand your own sense of well being.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:40:32):**  If you take a little while to like look into that, it's usually connected to the well being  
**[0:40:36-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:40:36):**  of things around you.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:40:38):**  It's not something you have to think too hard about.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:40:41):**  But in order to do that, you need to incorporate and sort of impose good design on your systems  
**[0:40:47-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:40:47):**  that you're working on.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:40:50):**  And so we always just go back to these sort of like concepts of permanence, things that  
**[0:40:56-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:40:56):**  will last a lot longer than your lifetime and decisions and impacts you can make that  
**[0:41:00-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:41:00):**  are going to go far beyond that.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:41:04):**  And it helps us now as well.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:41:05):**  So all this together, I think it's an important education platform, but more importantly,  
**[0:41:12-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:41:12):**  a place for me to live.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:41:15):**  Thanks.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:41:16):**  That's true.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:41:17):**  Without this, we'd all be so homeless.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:41:20):**  Doing fine, but like in the truest sense of the word, no real roots put down anywhere.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:41:26):**  We've all been traveling for quite a few years.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:41:29):**  If I were to sum up my real inspiration in the Homestead project that we're implementing  
**[0:41:33-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:41:33):**  here, you almost just do it in one word and that would be potential.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:41:39):**  I am constantly inspired and excited about helping to actualize or realize the full potential  
**[0:41:46-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:41:46):**  of a site.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:41:48):**  So we have just around an acre here.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:41:50):**  It's a little under and we get to wake up and go to work every day and figure out through  
**[0:41:57-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:41:57):**  observation and design how we can turn this little place into an absolute paradise, how  
**[0:42:03-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:42:03):**  we can create all of our favorite foods here, how we can live in a comfortable house made  
**[0:42:09-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:42:09):**  predominantly from materials that come from the nearby community, the potential for helping  
**[0:42:16-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:42:16):**  to spread this information and inspire others to reach the full potential within their own  
**[0:42:21-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:42:21):**  lives, uh, for their communities and for the environment at large.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:42:26):**  And that is just endlessly inspirational to me.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:42:29):**  And it's a living experiment.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:42:31):**  I get to live in an environment that we are constantly tweaking with, that we are constantly

**[0:42:37-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:42:37):**  We are, you know, using trial and error and some borderline janky science sometimes, um,  
**[0:42:44-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:42:44):**  to figure out exactly how good we can make this place.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:42:48):**  That's just too much fun.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:42:50):**  I think that it comes down to that for all three of us.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:42:53):**  This is just a blast.  
**[0:42:54-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:42:54):**  Like I wouldn't rather be doing anything right now.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:43:00):**  And we just want more people to come in and join on the fun and, you know, help them realize  
**[0:43:05-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:43:05):**  their potential for their lives as well.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:43:08):**  So let's move on real quick now and answer a couple of questions from the Facebook page.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:43:16):**  So let's start off with one that I know Jeremy is going to be, be able to answer the best.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:43:21):**  And this was submitted by David Jorgensen, who asked for us to elaborate a little bit  
**[0:43:27-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:43:27):**  on biochar production methods and how biochar can be introduced into a regenerative landscape  
**[0:43:33-0:43:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:43:33):**  system.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:43:34):**  Okay, cool.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:43:35):**  So yeah, let's talk about biochar.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:43:39):**  We'll talk about the production methods, but I guess just to bring everyone up to speed  
**[0:43:44-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:43:44):**  on what it is.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:43:47):**  The biochar is carbon in the form of wood, like the lignin of wood, or of trees I mean,  
**[0:43:55-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:43:55):**  sorry.  
**[0:43:56-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:43:56):**  Wood is lignin.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:43:57):**  Lignin is a material that you create biochar out of its, their carbon chains.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:44:01):**  And most carbon that we see in the form of wood or paper or other things like that, straw,  
**[0:44:10-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:44:10):**  hay, they are extremely bioactive, meaning that they break down very quickly with the  
**[0:44:15-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:44:15):**  right elements involved and cycle back into the atmosphere eventually and then get sequestered  
**[0:44:22-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:44:22):**  again.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:44:23):**  With biochar we're taking carbon and we're sequestering it or fixing it into a state  
**[0:44:28-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:44:28):**  that it maintains for a very long period of time, anywhere from 10,000 to 30,000 years  
**[0:44:37-0:44:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:44:37):**  from what I've heard.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:44:39):**  It's a mineralization process of the carbon.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:44:43):**  The reason why that's amazing is because when you're trying to manage fertility, especially  
**[0:44:46-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:44:46):**  in the tropics, carbon is our most important storage, not only for nutrients that are passing  
**[0:44:54-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:44:54):**  through the soil, but also for the biology that makes it possible for nutrients to pass  
**[0:45:02-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:45:02):**  up through the ecosystem via plants, then via invertebrates, vertebrates, blah blah

**[0:52:06-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:52:06):**  Hi, Amy.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:52:09):**  Yeah, good question.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:52:13):**  Setting up a nursery is actually a great thing to do for a bunch of reasons.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:52:19):**  It can be profitable.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:52:20):**  I've worked at a profitable nursery, but I've never got one off the ground or anything.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:52:26):**  But it's a decent way to make money, but it's also a great thing to do if you're starting  
**[0:52:33-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:52:33):**  a permaculture project because kind of like Jeremy was saying earlier, just sort of camping

**[0:52:43-0:52:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:52:43):**  where the different sectors are and all the rest of it.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:52:46):**  Building compost and starting a nursery are a great way to spend a year.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:52:53):**  And really you don't need much.  
**[0:52:55-0:53:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:52:55):**  Shad has a great video on Atitlan Organics called How to Propagate Plants Using Your

**[0:53:05-0:53:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:53:05):**  You propagate plants using your intuition.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:53:07):**  They will tell you how.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:53:09):**  If you spend any time looking at it at all, you will see they're either obviously flowering  
**[0:53:14-0:53:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:53:14):**  and giving a seed that you can identify.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:53:17):**  And if they're not, they're probably going to be woody and straight with nodes in it,  
**[0:53:22-0:53:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:53:22):**  in which case you try sticking them in the ground.  
**[0:53:26-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:53:26):**  Or they're going to be like dividing out their roots somehow.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:53:28):**  They're going to be like shooting out baby plants or falling along the ground.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:53:33):**  Somehow they're going to be trying to make more of themselves.  
**[0:53:35-0:53:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:53:35):**  That's what plants do.  
**[0:53:37-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:53:37):**  And it's really usually only one of those few ways.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:53:41):**  Once you propagate a fruit, for example, by a seed, you always have the option of grafting  
**[0:53:47-0:53:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:53:47):**  another variety of that fruit onto it.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:53:51):**  That's a whole different thing.  
**[0:53:52-0:53:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:53:52):**  But really to start a nursery, you don't even need to know that at the start.  
**[0:53:55-0:54:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:53:55):**  What you need is like a good soil mix and a lot of containers.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:54:02):**  Great things to use for containers.

**[0:54:05-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:54:05):**  You can buy the plastic bags from any gardening store that have holes in the bottom.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:54:09):**  But you can make your own as well.

**[0:54:18-0:54:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:54:18):**  for growing trees in.

**[0:54:30-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:54:30):**  That's just nicely drained.

**[0:54:42-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:54:42):**  If you're doing it in an outdoor space, put like a shade cloth over it if you get a lot

**[0:54:52-0:54:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:54:52):**  And yeah, like putting the plants in, you know, like simple things but that make a difference.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:54:59):**  Putting the plants in sections helps organizing it in a way that's just efficient to get around.

**[0:57:24-0:57:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:57:24):**  them is to take, if it's a plant that you think will propagate from stems, you can bend

**[0:57:36-0:57:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:57:36):**  make a little cut at a bud point on the plant.  
**[0:57:40-0:57:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:57:40):**  And if you have that stable to the ground and it's water hitting it regularly, that

**[0:57:48-0:57:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:57:48):**  This is what we call ground layering.  
**[0:57:52-0:57:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:57:52):**  It's a very simple technique.  
**[0:57:54-0:57:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:57:54):**  And if you give it enough time, you have a 100% success rate on that plant rooting or  
**[0:57:58-0:58:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:57:58):**  that branch rooting, you simply cut it off of the mother plant, dig it up, put it in  
**[0:58:03-0:58:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:58:03):**  a pot or replant it from there and you got yourself a new plant.  
**[0:58:07-0:58:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:58:07):**  Another one you can do is take soil in a bag or tinfoil, find a branch that you want to  
**[0:58:13-0:58:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:58:13):**  propagate, cut a little notch like we said in one of the buds, put that bag or tinfoil  
**[0:58:20-0:58:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:58:20):**  wrap over it with the soil in it.  
**[0:58:22-0:58:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:58:22):**  You want something nice and moist that holds water quite well.  
**[0:58:28-0:58:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:58:28):**  And wrap it around with your string or wrap the tinfoil around it many times.  
**[0:58:34-0:58:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:58:34):**  That will create an environment for the plant to put roots into and simply cutting below  
**[0:58:40-0:58:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:58:40):**  that bag after it's rooted into there means you got yourself a new plant.

**[0:58:48-0:58:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:58:48):**  time.

**[0:58:59-0:59:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:58:59):**  feel like putting the time into watering them or anything like that.

**[0:59:18-0:59:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:59:18):**  seven and I haven't eaten dinner yet.  
**[0:59:20-0:59:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:59:20):**  We all should get some food.  
**[0:59:23-0:59:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:59:23):**  But before we go, do you guys have anything you want to add about the direction that we're  
**[0:59:28-0:59:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:59:28):**  headed with our educational programs and development of this place before the end of the dry season?  
**[0:59:35-0:59:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:59:35):**  Well, education programs, just like I say, we want to keep learning ourselves and I think  
**[0:59:44-0:59:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:59:44):**  the big direction we want to go in is as well as doing high quality courses like the one  
**[0:59:50-0:59:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:59:50):**  we did up in with Lorenzo in Dali Leo and the ones we're doing with Atidlan Organics  
**[0:59:57-1:00:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=0:59:57):**  would also be like more internships and mentoring programs where we can take people on and really  
**[1:00:04-1:00:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=1:00:04):**  just like I say distill down the information or the experience that we've gathered and  
**[1:00:11-1:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=1:00:11):**  get people working on and seeing projects that we're managing ourselves and learn by  
**[1:00:18-1:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=1:00:18):**  doing, which is by far the fastest way to do anything.  
**[1:00:22-1:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=1:00:22):**  So yeah, developing I guess that kind of experiential learning platform I think is our next step.  
**[1:00:30-1:00:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=1:00:30):**  Yeah I'm in full agreement on that.  
**[1:00:32-1:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=1:00:32):**  I love the courses, it's a great way to get a lot of outreach but to really focus in and  
**[1:00:38-1:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=1:00:38):**  get professionals moving in this career path, doing these internships and apprentices to  
**[1:00:46-1:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=1:00:46):**  me is super important because it's actually the only way that I got really into this.  
**[1:00:50-1:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=1:00:50):**  As well for us it's not just like something that we're trying to give out to the world,  
**[1:00:56-1:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=1:00:56):**  we need professionals working with us so we can have a team going like we want to.  
**[1:01:01-1:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=1:01:01):**  This can mean like instead of just people coming and learning and going on off with  
**[1:01:05-1:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=1:01:05):**  what we taught them we actually become associates or like professionals working together, it's  
**[1:01:13-1:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=1:01:13):**  very important and I think it's important to create a horizontal kind of working relationship  
**[1:01:20-1:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=1:01:20):**  with the people that we call students who are actually just human beings like us that  
**[1:01:25-1:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=1:01:25):**  probably know more things than us in a lot of ways.  
**[1:01:33-1:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=1:01:33):**  That's definitely one way to look at it.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=1:01:34):**  Human beings, what a guy, like wow he considers his students to be human beings.

**[1:01:40-1:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=1:01:40):**  It's a good place to start.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=1:01:41):**  Instead of students.  
**[1:01:42-1:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=1:01:42):**  No, I'm just kidding Jared, that was really sweet actually.  
**[1:01:48-1:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=1:01:48):**  Yeah I mean that's one of the things I'm most excited about too is that we're not just running  
**[1:01:53-1:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=1:01:53):**  simple education programs for people who want to throw in a little garden here and there.

**[1:02:04-1:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=1:02:04):**  that we're working on here but we're actually building a larger team to help us do more

**[1:02:15-1:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=1:02:15):**  and growing our team is really what's turning into one of the unintended parts of the fun  
**[1:02:22-1:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-regenerative-round-table-1-designing-for-abundance-biochar-production-and-plant-propagation/#t=1:02:22):**  of this season that we're having.

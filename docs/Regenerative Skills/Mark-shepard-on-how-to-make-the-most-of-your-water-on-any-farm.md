**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:00:33):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:00:37):**  Alright, welcome everyone to the first episode of a brand new season of the Abundant Edge  
**[0:00:46-0:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:00:46):**  Podcast.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:00:47):**  I can't believe I'm starting the fourth year of this little pet project that I had  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:00:50):**  three years ago after I had just moved to Guatemala and was wrapping up an internship  
**[0:00:54-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:00:54):**  on bamboo building.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:00:56):**  And now here I am, having moved to northeastern Spain and with more than 50,000 of you incredible  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:01:01):**  folks tuning into this show every month from all around the world.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:01:05):**  I'm so happy to be able to keep this show going and I'm really excited to start a  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:01:08):**  new season with a brand new website that makes it easier than ever to search for topics,  
**[0:01:13-0:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:01:13):**  names, categories and really anything you want to help you access the great information  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:01:17):**  for more than 140 interviews in our archives.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:01:21):**  I really encourage you all to check it out if you haven't yet and of course, if you  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:01:24):**  enjoy the content of this show, please consider leaving us a review on iTunes or whichever  
**[0:01:29-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:01:29):**  service provider you use.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:01:30):**  More than anything, this helps me get these episodes out and into the ears of more people  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:01:35):**  and that means more people equipped with the knowledge and the techniques to begin to heal  
**[0:01:39-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:01:39):**  and regenerate this planet.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:01:40):**  But that's enough of the prologue, let's jump into today's episode.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:01:44):**  So for those of you who have been following the last handful of episodes, you know that  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:01:48):**  we're deep into an ongoing series on reforestation and agroforestry.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:01:52):**  And though most of the previous interviews have been with people working directly to  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:01:55):**  plant trees and restore native forests, I decided to switch the focus for this session  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:02:00):**  for two important reasons.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:02:01):**  The first is that without good soil and access to water, very few things will grow or at  
**[0:02:06-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:02:06):**  least they'll take much, much longer to get established.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:02:09):**  The second is that Mark Sheppard, founder of New Forest Farm in Wisconsin and the author  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:02:13):**  of Restoration Agriculture, has finally just released his much awaited second book called  
**[0:02:19-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:02:19):**  Water for Any Farm, which outlines his revolutionary expansion on the PA Yeoman's original classic  
**[0:02:25-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:02:25):**  called Water for Every Farm.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:02:27):**  Now in this interview I got to speak with Mark about how his decades of experience on  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:02:31):**  his own farm, as well as designing and consulting on farms all over the country, helped him  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:02:36):**  to solve some of the shortcomings from the original Keyline design system.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:02:40):**  We start by talking about how the mismanagement of land and water has created the conditions  
**[0:02:45-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:02:45):**  that we have today all over the world where topsoil is constantly eroded and water quickly  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:02:51):**  becomes a destructive force rather than a rejuvenating one if it's left to run over  
**[0:02:55-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:02:55):**  naked landscapes.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:02:57):**  Mark goes into a lot of detail to describe how to read your landscape and identify key  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:03:02):**  points that can be used as references for key lines to direct water all across your  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:03:06):**  land in a way that slows it down and rehydrates the soil.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:03:11):**  We talk about what machinery and tools he recommends for major earthworks, the installation  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:03:15):**  of different types of ponds, building soil over large acreage, and much more.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:03:20):**  Now I get sent a lot of books to look over and review before speaking with authors, and  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:03:24):**  I often don't have time to read them very thoroughly, but this one, Water for Any Farm,  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:03:29):**  I really took the time to understand because of the incredible potential that this system  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:03:34):**  has for increasing the productivity and resilience of any landscape, not just from an agricultural  
**[0:03:39-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:03:39):**  perspective.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:03:40):**  Adjusting the water harvesting capacity of your terrain can have an important impact  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:03:44):**  on any kind of regeneration project and help with weathering severe climate challenges  
**[0:03:49-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:03:49):**  too.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:03:50):**  It's especially relevant to the ongoing series on reforestation and agroforestry because  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:03:54):**  the earthworks method outlined in this book is how Mark was able to regenerate a damaged  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:03:59):**  farm surrounded by monoculture and corn crops into the highly productive oak-savanna mimicking  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:04:04):**  ecosystem based around the pillars of hazelnut and chestnut orchards.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:04:08):**  I highly recommend you check this book out.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:04:10):**  I've put links to where you can buy it and learn more about Mark and his work in our  
**[0:04:14-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:04:14):**  show notes for this episode on the website.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:04:16):**  So let's kick off season four and I'll hand things over now to Mark Sheppard.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:04:20):**  Hey Mark, thanks so much for taking the time to be on the show again.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:04:24):**  It's a real pleasure to talk to you.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:04:25):**  How have you been?  
**[0:04:26-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:04:26):**  Hey, been doing pretty well yourself Oliver.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:04:28):**  Thanks for having me on.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:04:29):**  Yeah, it's my pleasure.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:04:30):**  I've been doing real well and I'm super excited.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:04:32):**  First of all, congratulations on the release of your new book, Water for Any Farm.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:04:37):**  Now I know in southwestern Wisconsin where your farm is, it's known as an area that's  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:04:42):**  got quite a bit of water through rainfall and isn't considered like arid or water scarce.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:04:48):**  So what inspired you to focus an entire book on water?  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:04:52):**  Well the book on water, Water for Any Farm, is the focus of this one.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:04:58):**  It's actually part of an overall restoration agriculture series.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:05:04):**  Recreation agriculture, my first book, explained how New Forest Farm was designed to imitate  
**[0:05:10-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:05:10):**  a natural plant community type, the oak savanna, and convert agricultural production from annual  
**[0:05:18-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:05:18):**  cropping to perennial cropping using those plant communities as the template.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:05:24):**  Well the first thing we wanted to do is manage the water so that even though southwest Wisconsin  
**[0:05:31-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:05:31):**  gets a decent amount of rain, about 30 inches a meter thereabouts of rain per year, there  
**[0:05:37-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:05:37):**  are times when it goes without.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:05:39):**  It was one year I went completely without rain.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:05:42):**  On the second year, it went almost the whole year without rain.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:05:45):**  And so I wanted to make sure that we had adequate water stored in ponds and in the soil.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:05:53):**  And another example is Middle Tennessee and Kentucky this past calendar year, 2019, two  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:05:58):**  times the normal rainfall amount, like 80 inches, somewhat 80 inches of rain.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:06:04):**  However, in the middle of this year where they're getting twice the annual rainfall,  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:06:08):**  they had the longest dry spell in history.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:06:12):**  And so they actually had the biggest drought ever, even though they had twice the rain.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:06:17):**  Well so if we're having twice the rain and having these long dry spells, the water was  
**[0:06:22-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:06:22):**  there for continued agricultural production if it was captured, delivered to a place,  
**[0:06:29-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:06:29):**  stored, soaked into the soil, et cetera.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:06:32):**  And it seems like we're starting to move towards this larger trend of heavier rainfall events  
**[0:06:37-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:06:37):**  followed by larger droughts as the climate starts to shift and is affected by human intervention.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:06:44):**  So this is all the more important to really set up these systems that can make best use  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:06:50):**  of these massive events in order to kind of draw them out and create access throughout  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:06:56):**  the landscape when the dry spells also occur.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:07:00):**  So with that in mind, let's start by talking a little bit about how the agricultural techniques  
**[0:07:05-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:07:05):**  of settlers moving west in the US after colonization quickly started to deplete the immense fertility  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:07:12):**  of these savannah lands, like a perfect example of where you're located.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:07:16):**  Yeah, well the agricultural techniques of the first European settlers were all based  
**[0:07:22-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:07:22):**  and derived around growing annual grain crops for human consumption for livestock feed,  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:07:29):**  which required eliminating the perennial ecology that was in place.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:07:35):**  If it was forested like in the east, it was clear cut, then the stumps ripped out and  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:07:40):**  burned and then the ground was plowed, which exposed it to the rain and to the wind, so  
**[0:07:45-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:07:45):**  the soil began to wash away.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:07:47):**  It didn't have the natural perennial system rebuilding the soil after it was originally  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:07:54):**  oxidized by plowing and then, like I said, eroded away with wind and rain.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:07:59):**  Same with the savannas and same with the prairies and of course same in the arid, more drier  
**[0:08:04-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:08:04):**  areas.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:08:05):**  So basically it was clearing of land in order to plow to grow annual crops and the big two  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:08:12):**  monsters in the upper Midwest anyways, the whole central US, is corn and beans.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:08:16):**  Those are the biggest ones in the Midwest.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:08:18):**  Yeah, it's a shame that so many of these techniques continue until today and one of the things  
**[0:08:23-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:08:23):**  that you mentioned early on in the book is how some fairly enlightened early policymakers  
**[0:08:29-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:08:29):**  for American agricultural policy started to shift towards a smarter way of managing these  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:08:36):**  landscapes to reduce the amount of erosion and soil depletion that was going on.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:08:41):**  But you're trying to take a few steps forward to not just minimizing the loss, but actually  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:08:47):**  start to regain the fertility and the resilience of these landscapes.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:08:51):**  So as you state in chapter two, this book was written for professional agriculturalists  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:08:56):**  and the language and the terms are really meant to help alternative farmers to communicate  
**[0:09:02-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:09:02):**  with government officials.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:09:04):**  Could you elaborate a little on why it's necessary to be able to do that?  
**[0:09:08-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:09:08):**  Well, you had kind of touched on it a little bit, but everybody who is involved with growing  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:09:16):**  things on the ground, we have our own language, we come from our own background of describing  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:09:21):**  how we deal with water and the whole permaculture side of things, which is where I came from  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:09:26):**  before I got into large scale farming, uses a different set of language words than the  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:09:32):**  that farmers use, which is a different set of words than civil engineers and stormwater  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:09:38):**  managers use, which is a different set of words than what army corps of engineers used  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:09:43):**  and so on.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:09:44):**  And no matter where we go, we have different levels of government authority.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:09:50):**  Some of it is hard authority, they will arrest you if you do things incorrectly.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:09:55):**  Some of it is permitting authority, some of it is more of a soft authority, such as with  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:10:00):**  the USDA best management practices and their agricultural codes.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:10:05):**  So what we need to do is we need to be able to grow, farm, whatever we're farming.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:10:13):**  So we need to have our water managed somehow.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:10:15):**  Well, we as the people actually growing food for sale, etc., we need to be able to use  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:10:22):**  language that describes what we do so that these various different governing officials  
**[0:10:27-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:10:27):**  understand what we're doing and from the opposite side, of course, we have to understand what  
**[0:10:33-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:10:33):**  are the different rules that we have to comply with.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:10:36):**  I was just in a workshop two days ago where there was a fellow from Washington State and  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:10:43):**  it's a water rights state, which means somebody owns the raindrops that falls on your farm.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:10:48):**  That sounds perverse to me.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:10:50):**  And they were, he's not allowed to store water in any thing like a container or a pond at  
**[0:10:57-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:10:57):**  all.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:10:58):**  So how do you accomplish the objectives of having that rainfall be effective in your  
**[0:11:04-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:11:04):**  landscape and not be stored in a liquid form in a container or a pond?  
**[0:11:11-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:11:11):**  And so we need to be able to comply with these rules of wherever we are and yet still be  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:11:19):**  able to harvest our own rainwater, distribute it around our own farm and have it stored  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:11:24):**  in the soil where we can access it later on for crop productivity.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:11:28):**  Yeah, and as much of a minefield as it must be getting into farming with all of the regulations  
**[0:11:34-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:11:34):**  and the things that you have to accommodate and understand and follow in this age of all  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:11:42):**  the litigation around it, I think it's a really important step, especially outlined in this  
**[0:11:47-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:11:47):**  book that facilitates that kind of conversation so that people can start to make progress  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:11:52):**  and move towards ecological ways of production while still working with the system and helping  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:11:57):**  to guide it into something that aspires to a better way of managing the land.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:12:03):**  So designing to mitigate normal extreme weather events is something that you really stress  
**[0:12:09-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:12:09):**  in this book because like you said, the extremities of these patterns is a given and people are  
**[0:12:16-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:12:16):**  continuously looking at them as anomalies that are things that don't necessarily need  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:12:21):**  to be accounted for and are unfortunate events and something either just to buy insurance  
**[0:12:25-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:12:25):**  for.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:12:26):**  But you really go to the source in saying that these events are the norm in nature and  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:12:32):**  they should be accommodated for at the beginning of the design.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:12:36):**  Can you tell me a little bit how you've managed to do that in some examples of your own work?  
**[0:12:41-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:12:41):**  Well because what's interesting about that the whole question is, in one sense, it's  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:12:47):**  a sense of perspective in that, guess what?  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:12:52):**  We're going to get a huge rain event some point in time and if we don't plan for that,  
**[0:12:57-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:12:57):**  it's not a disaster.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:12:59):**  It's coming.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:13:00):**  It's going to happen.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:13:01):**  There will be a big rain event.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:13:03):**  So we designed for it.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:13:05):**  Then we don't have these disasters and let's just take an example.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:13:09):**  Last summer, or a year ago, 2018, there was a 19.5 inch rainfall in Cross Plains, Wisconsin  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:13:18):**  that I happened to be driving down the road when it hit and there was this literally a  
**[0:13:22-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:13:22):**  flash flood.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:13:23):**  I mean this water, wall of water came out of nowhere and washed several cars off the  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:13:28):**  road, blew out a bridge, people died, an amazing amount of destruction.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:13:34):**  One of the reasons why the flooding was so extreme is that all of the agricultural land  
**[0:13:41-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:13:41):**  surrounding Cross Plains, Wisconsin had no water management structures or strategy in  
**[0:13:49-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:13:49):**  place.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:13:50):**  The only water management structures that were in place were tile drainage to help the  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:13:56):**  water drain off of the agricultural fields faster.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:14:01):**  So the current agricultural USDA best management practices of tile draining those fields so  
**[0:14:08-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:14:08):**  corn could be planted way too early in the season actually made the floods worse.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:14:14):**  So if we just understand that we're going to get a big rainstorm, that more rain will  
**[0:14:21-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:14:21):**  fall in a given period of time than the soil can absorb, we need to mitigate that.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:14:28):**  We need to spread it out, redistribute it.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:14:30):**  We need to store it in particular locations and allow it to now move through the landscape  
**[0:14:36-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:14:36):**  more slowly and will help to mitigate these and eliminate these flash floods that happen  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:14:42):**  all over the place.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:14:46):**  Because storms, hurricanes are not a natural disaster.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:14:51):**  Hurricanes are normal.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:14:52):**  They're real.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:14:53):**  The same thing, let's just switch and go to fire in California.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:14:57):**  California is a fire driven, a fire disturbed landscape and has been for zillions of years.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:15:06):**  It is pure design stupidity for human beings to build flammable buildings in a fire environment  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:15:16):**  because we know that the fire will come.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:15:20):**  It's a fire environment, always has been.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:15:23):**  And so it's not a disaster when the fire comes, but having buildings that explode in the heat  
**[0:15:30-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:15:30):**  actually make the disaster.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:15:32):**  They make the fire worse.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:15:34):**  So why don't we just understand that floodplains flood?  
**[0:15:41-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:15:41):**  It's not a disaster.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:15:42):**  It's normal.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:15:43):**  And I think it's just a perspective issue.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:15:45):**  And if we look at it from the fact that these events, whether it's fire or huge rainstorms,  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:15:52):**  hurricanes, these are normal events on planet Earth.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:15:56):**  We human beings need to understand how to live within the context of normal events on  
**[0:16:03-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:16:03):**  planet Earth.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:16:04):**  Yeah, I couldn't agree more.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:16:06):**  That's really well said.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:16:07):**  And, you know, I've done interviews with people like Eric Olson, who've talked in detail about  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:16:11):**  the fire ecologies in California and how the disastrous element of them are the failings  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:16:17):**  of our design, our infrastructure to accommodate the natural rhythms of that ecosystem.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:16:22):**  And just like you were talking about with the floodplains and the hurricanes, those  
**[0:16:26-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:16:26):**  were all here before us.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:16:28):**  But they're starting to get worse and become disasters because of the way that we've integrated  
**[0:16:32-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:16:32):**  our lives without accommodating those things or designing in a way that can absorb or work  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:16:39):**  with the energies that naturally come through those areas.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:16:43):**  So let's talk about some of the primary elements that you use to make use of these resources  
**[0:16:49-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:16:49):**  as they come onto the landscape.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:16:52):**  And one of the main ones is the swale.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:16:55):**  Now it goes by a lot of other names in your book.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:16:57):**  You refer to it as the swile, making fun a little bit of the Australian accent of the  
**[0:17:02-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:17:02):**  guys who kind of pioneered this.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:17:04):**  I love that.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:17:06):**  So let's start at the beginning and talk about, A, what it's used for.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:17:10):**  And we can refer to it as in other terms because it can be used as a lot of different things,  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:17:15):**  but also when it's not appropriate as a method for collecting rainwater.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:17:20):**  Right.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:17:21):**  So, well, from the permaculture perspective, a swale is a water harvesting ditch.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:17:29):**  We make a channel and with the soil that you remove from this channel, you put it into  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:17:35):**  a pile down slope from that.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:17:40):**  What's really fascinating is a swale as described that way and the way the permaculture is to  
**[0:17:45-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:17:45):**  use the term fits the definition, the USDA definition of a terrace.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:17:51):**  There's all kinds of different terrace shapes and forms.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:17:55):**  It's not like a rice paddy terrace that you see on the mountains of Bali or Machu Picchu,  
**[0:18:00-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:18:00):**  stuff like that.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:18:01):**  It's a swale.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:18:04):**  You'd make a channel and then with the material you remove from the channel, you make a ridge  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:18:08):**  or a mound or berm, whatever you want to call it.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:18:13):**  When it's pitched at a gradient, slightly downhill on one end, water will move through  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:18:22):**  that water collecting channel.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:18:28):**  Used as a directional water delivery system, it's one of the simplest ways to make water  
**[0:18:35-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:18:35):**  move in a landscape is by digging a little channel in the soil.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:18:42):**  As a water movement structure, that's applicable on any landscapes, all over the place, flat,  
**[0:18:50-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:18:50):**  steep, dry, et cetera.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:18:52):**  If you have a channel in the soil to move excess rain by excess rain, when you get a  
**[0:18:57-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:18:57):**  rain event, even in Saudi Arabia for example, a lot of the landforms in Saudi Arabia are  
**[0:19:04-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:19:04):**  caused by water erosion.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:19:05):**  It's like, what?  
**[0:19:06-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:19:06):**  It's a desert.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:19:07):**  It's like, that's right.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:19:09):**  There's hardly any vegetation holding things together, so when the rain does come, it doesn't  
**[0:19:14-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:19:14):**  infiltrate because the soil is too hot, it's too packed, it's already super dry.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:19:21):**  It runs off and it creates erosion.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:19:23):**  When this water comes, even if it's on perfectly quote, unquote flat land and there's no such  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:19:28):**  thing, you make a channel in the ground and you can move the water to a location where  
**[0:19:33-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:19:33):**  you can store it.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:19:35):**  As it's moving along, it's also soaking in.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:19:39):**  The swale, a water collecting channel with a mound in combination, is usable as a water  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:19:50):**  delivery technique in all landscapes, any landscapes.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:19:54):**  A swale used as a water infiltration technique would be more applicable on the upland sites  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:20:03):**  up and once you start to get above floodplains, et cetera.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:20:07):**  What's interesting about this swale, now we're using it in the uplands as a water infiltration  
**[0:20:12-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:20:12):**  system.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:20:13):**  Well, now down low in the lowlands, say river floodplains or in the example of the Netherlands  
**[0:20:20-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:20:20):**  and Louisiana, places, UK, these are all places where I've worked below sea level, we can  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:20:28):**  use the same structure, an excavated channel with a mound.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:20:33):**  We're actually using that in order to create dry land up on the mound.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:20:39):**  So the same structure, a channel with a mound, can be used in various different parts of  
**[0:20:45-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:20:45):**  the landscape and it has a different effect because of where it is.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:20:49):**  We can use it to soak water, we can use it to deliver water, we can use it to actually  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:20:55):**  create dry land to plant on, et cetera.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:21:00):**  From my perspective, I see that applicable in all landscapes.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:21:06):**  Even in areas, especially in the far north, where you get frozen ground or snow in the  
**[0:21:12-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:21:12):**  wintertime, when you have frozen ground, no matter how fertile your soil is, you will  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:21:19):**  not get water infiltration when it rains on frozen ground, for example.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:21:25):**  100% of it will run off.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:21:27):**  So we want to capture that, send it to a location where it can be stored, a pond, a tank, et  
**[0:21:33-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:21:33):**  cetera.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:21:34):**  If nothing else, we want to slow it down.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:21:37):**  So instead of it roaring down the hill and creating flash floods with all these properties  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:21:41):**  in the uplands, sending water down to the village or town, now we flood out the town,  
**[0:21:45-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:21:45):**  we prevent the floods by just slowing it down and retaining it in the uplands for a while.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:21:52):**  So snow melt, rapid snow melt and rain on frozen ground is another great reason to have  
**[0:21:58-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:21:58):**  swales in the landscape.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:22:00):**  There's a lot of people that just get some kind of visceral reaction against the idea  
**[0:22:07-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:22:07):**  of putting a swale on a property.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:22:09):**  For whatever their objections are, most of what I've observed is when people have an  
**[0:22:15-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:22:15):**  objection to having a channel with a mound, the most of the objections that I see is that  
**[0:22:22-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:22:22):**  those people don't understand how to use that as a design element to make your farming operation  
**[0:22:30-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:22:30):**  more efficient.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:22:31):**  One of the biggest complaints is that they're in the way.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:22:35):**  Well, once you put these channels in the ground, they are the way.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:22:39):**  So it's in our best interest to have a sound, prudent, well-thought-out, efficient design  
**[0:22:47-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:22:47):**  so then they aren't in the way.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:22:49):**  Or you just design crossings to go over them.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:22:52):**  Other people complain that, oh, well, it takes land out of production.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:22:55):**  Well, if you take a smooth slope and then you add a triangular channel, and I wish I  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:23:04):**  could draw you a picture of this, and then make a nice, smooth, triangular mound, you  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:23:09):**  actually can design it around the farming equipment based on the equipment, and you  
**[0:23:13-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:23:13):**  actually increase the surface area on which you can farm.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:23:17):**  So if you take a five-acre farm, you could possibly gain as much as an extra acre of  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:23:22):**  surface area because you've added these convolutions to it, and you've done it in such a way that  
**[0:23:27-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:23:27):**  it's efficient for your equipment, and it actually accomplishes whatever your design  
**[0:23:32-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:23:32):**  objectives are with this water, whether it's in drier climates, you may want to focus it  
**[0:23:38-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:23:38):**  on a storage pond for later irrigation.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:23:41):**  In wetter climates, you may want to move it away from your wetter spots to irrigate drier  
**[0:23:46-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:23:46):**  ridge.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:23:47):**  So I see them as a useful tool when appropriately designed and applied on all landscapes everywhere,  
**[0:23:58-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:23:58):**  any farm.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:24:00):**  And if you don't want swales, don't put them in!  
**[0:24:04-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:24:04):**  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:24:06):**  Yeah, it's not mandatory by any means.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:24:09):**  And the basis of the methodology that you're teaching from here is also much of the inspiration  
**[0:24:15-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:24:15):**  of the title of the book, which is P.A.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:24:17):**  Yeoman's original Water for Every Farm.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:24:21):**  And you've since kind of applied a lot of those things, but also come up with your own  
**[0:24:26-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:24:26):**  methodology based on your experience and how you've seen this work in the field.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:24:30):**  Could you talk a little bit about how you sort of backed into the Master Line system,  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:24:36):**  which is outlined well in the book, and found the Master Line of New Forest Farm that connected  
**[0:24:41-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:24:41):**  most of the primary valleys for your site?  
**[0:24:44-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:24:44):**  Well, the Water for Every Farm by P.A. Yeomans, the whole Keyline design methodology really  
**[0:24:55-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:24:55):**  pivots around a really simple way to look at the landscape and observe how water moves  
**[0:25:03-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:25:03):**  on the landscape.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:25:04):**  You know, a primary valley is like the first land form where water actually becomes channelized  
**[0:25:12-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:25:12):**  naturally in an overflow event, and the water starts to move.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:25:16):**  And you go up to the head of these water moving channels called primary valleys, and that  
**[0:25:22-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:25:22):**  is a key point in the landscape.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:25:24):**  Well, in Water for Every Farm, the key point is used as a design element.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:25:30):**  You make a reference line at that key point, which is a contour line from that key point,  
**[0:25:37-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:25:37):**  perfectly horizontal.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:25:39):**  Then when you're in primary valleys below that contour line, that key line, you use  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:25:46):**  your equipment, you build your fences, you till or whatever it is that you do, you rotate  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:25:52):**  your cattle parallel to that and down in the primary valley forms.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:25:57):**  Well, coupled with that is you start on a ridge of the lowest practical ridge contour,  
**[0:26:04-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:26:04):**  and you make a contour line, that's your ridge reference line.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:26:07):**  And then on the ridge forms, you now use the landscape parallel to that ridge reference  
**[0:26:13-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:26:13):**  line and upward.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:26:15):**  Well, it's all well and good, and Yeoman says it works on every landscape everywhere.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:26:22):**  And maybe when the book was written and how they applied it in Australia, maybe that is  
**[0:26:28-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:26:28):**  true.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:26:29):**  But Australia happens to be the hydrologically simplest landform on the planet.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:26:36):**  It has no river systems that are more complex than a third order stream.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:26:44):**  Two primary valleys come together to make a secondary, and actually the rest of the  
**[0:26:49-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:26:49):**  world calls that a first order stream.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:26:51):**  So two first order streams come together to make a second order stream.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:26:56):**  If more first order streams are added to it, it's still a second order stream.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:27:00):**  When two second order streams come together, they make a third order stream, and that is  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:27:05):**  as complex as Australia is anywhere.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:27:09):**  So it's a very simplified landscape compared to most of the rest of the world.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:27:15):**  The Mississippi River watershed, where I had to try to apply this Keyline design principles,  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:27:23):**  it's the most complex river system on the face of the planet.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:27:27):**  I think it's a tenth order stream, or maybe an eleventh.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:27:29):**  I don't remember right now offhand.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:27:31):**  And so in order to design a water management system on the most complex landform on the  
**[0:27:39-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:27:39):**  planet using the simplified Keyline cultivation pattern did not work, does not work.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:27:47):**  Most of the people that I encounter who call me and my design team in to help them with  
**[0:27:53-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:27:53):**  their water management on their property have tried to do Yeoman's simple techniques, and  
**[0:28:01-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:28:01):**  it hasn't worked, and they scratch their heads and wonder why.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:28:04):**  Another very strong part of the whole Keyline design methodology is creating channels that  
**[0:28:13-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:28:13):**  connect ponds that are at your key points in the landscape, connect them with a water  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:28:23):**  conveyance channel, they call them diversion drains.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:28:26):**  You would make these water channels to move water from one pond to the next to the next  
**[0:28:30-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:28:30):**  to the next, but what ends up having to happen is that will mess with the patterning on the  
**[0:28:38-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:28:38):**  land.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:28:39):**  So these two things within Keyline design, these cascading series of ponds and the Keyline  
**[0:28:45-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:28:45):**  cultivation pattern, if you put the two of them together, they don't really work well.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:28:49):**  So most people have been confused by the Keyline methodology, one, because that simple way  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:28:58):**  of describing landforms does not apply to a complex landform.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:29:03):**  And then to start moving water from one pond to the next, this word is used over and over  
**[0:29:08-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:29:08):**  again in all of the Keyline books that I've read anywhere, adjust accordingly.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:29:14):**  Well, they don't tell you how to adjust, because when you adjust, you can all of a sudden,  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:29:19):**  when you're taking your ridge reference lines and your key lines and you're making your  
**[0:29:23-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:29:23):**  parallels up on the ridges and parallels down in the valleys on a complex landform, those  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:29:29):**  may not pitch in the direction that you want the water to go.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:29:34):**  And so when you adjust, you either create a high spot in the middle of your tillage  
**[0:29:39-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:29:39):**  pattern or your water channels or a low spot.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:29:41):**  So there's all these complexities that are not addressed in Water for Every Farm by P.A.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:29:50):**  Yeomans.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:29:51):**  Well, the techniques that I outline in Water for Any Farm, because it is for any farm,  
**[0:29:57-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:29:57):**  is that what are your goals with water when it rains on your property faster than your  
**[0:30:02-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:30:02):**  soil can soak it in?  
**[0:30:04-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:30:04):**  What do you want to do with that water?  
**[0:30:06-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:30:06):**  Do you want to move it somewhere and store it?  
**[0:30:08-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:30:08):**  Do you want to slow it down?  
**[0:30:09-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:30:09):**  Do you want to soak it in?  
**[0:30:11-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:30:11):**  There are a number of different things that you, based on your design goals, want to do.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:30:17):**  And then how do we adjust our agricultural use of the land so as to be more efficient  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:30:26):**  while simultaneously accomplishing our water management objectives?  
**[0:30:31-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:30:31):**  I don't know if that made any sense or if we just had question creep and I went off  
**[0:30:35-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:30:35):**  into left field somewhere.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:30:36):**  No, no, it made really good sense to me, but I also have the chance to go through your  
**[0:30:40-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:30:40):**  book so I know exactly what you're talking about.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:30:42):**  So what happened on New Forest Farm is I literally took, this was before the age of the internet  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:30:47):**  and it was before the age of cell phones, you dial a phone call out of your town and  
**[0:30:52-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:30:52):**  it cost you like three bucks.  
**[0:30:53-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:30:53):**  So I made phone calls to Australia to find an out of print, small publishing book intended  
**[0:31:01-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:31:01):**  for farmers in Australia and I finally found it.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:31:04):**  So now I've got this book in my hands and I'm following directions right out of the  
**[0:31:08-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:31:08):**  book and Yeoman says if you go find a key point and you put in a key line, the key line  
**[0:31:14-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:31:14):**  is in the valley form only until the valley turns outward and one of my primary valleys  
**[0:31:22-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:31:22):**  on the farm, you start at the key point, the left side of it turns outward so you stop  
**[0:31:28-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:31:28):**  just as it starts to turn outward on the valley.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:31:31):**  Well, on the right hand side, the valley didn't curve outward, it kept curving inward and  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:31:36):**  inward and inward and there were no water movement channels in that curve and so right  
**[0:31:41-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:31:41):**  there if I was trying to follow the key line protocol to a letter, my land did not behave  
**[0:31:51-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:31:51):**  the way Yeoman's said it always does and that was the first problem I encountered.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:31:57):**  So what I ended up doing then was to start at the key points.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:32:01):**  Now this is actually, the key line design methodology is brilliant and Yeoman's was  
**[0:32:07-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:32:07):**  the person who actually coined the term key point and if you use your fingers as an example,  
**[0:32:13-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:32:13):**  if you put your, make a fist where the line is between your fingers, that's a primary  
**[0:32:18-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:32:18):**  valley in your handscape.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:32:20):**  Well where the primary valley now becomes the fleshy web between your fingers, that's  
**[0:32:25-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:32:25):**  the key point in the landscape.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:32:26):**  No one else had bothered to pay attention to that before and so that was a brilliant  
**[0:32:32-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:32:32):**  discovery by P.A. Yeoman's.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:32:34):**  Well then in a landscape, what's interesting is all the different key points are at different  
**[0:32:41-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:32:41):**  elevations higher and lower than one another and if you look at those key points on your  
**[0:32:45-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:32:45):**  hands, they're not way down by your knuckles or your fingertips, they're way up high in  
**[0:32:49-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:32:49):**  the landscape or the top of that ridge.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:32:52):**  So by identifying the key points on your property, then designing your water management system  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:32:58):**  based on those key points, you've all of a sudden started to manage the water high up  
**[0:33:03-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:33:03):**  on the landscape and the landform and now you have the ability to soak it in and move  
**[0:33:08-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:33:08):**  it through channels all the way through your property slowly and carefully giving it extra  
**[0:33:14-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:33:14):**  residence time so it can soak into the ground.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:33:17):**  So that's how I backed into what we're calling the Master Line system because on every landform,  
**[0:33:24-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:33:24):**  on every property that you've got, somewhere on that property is a single line that will  
**[0:33:31-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:33:31):**  optimize your ability to influence the distribution and the soaking, the infiltration of the rainfall  
**[0:33:43-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:33:43):**  that falls on your site.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:33:44):**  There really is, even Yeoman's even says it, that one of the principle considerations is  
**[0:33:48-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:33:48):**  to make a series of cascading ponds that the diversion drain from one pond fills the next  
**[0:33:55-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:33:55):**  one which diverts and fills the next one and fills the next one.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:33:58):**  That is a description of the Master Line system, that's where we start.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:34:03):**  Well then how we on the Master Line system diverge from that is instead of following  
**[0:34:10-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:34:10):**  a protocol of find the primary valleys and go parallel down from the key line and parallel  
**[0:34:16-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:34:16):**  up from the ridge reference line, we go ahead and ask, well what do you want to do with  
**[0:34:20-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:34:20):**  the water?  
**[0:34:21-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:34:21):**  What crops are you going to be growing or pasture animals are you going to graze?  
**[0:34:25-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:34:25):**  What's the equipment that you're using and now we will design a farm design based around  
**[0:34:32-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:34:32):**  that Master Line that moves the water where we want to do it at first.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:34:36):**  Then if we choose, we can put additional channels, terraces in USDA terminology, swales and berms  
**[0:34:44-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:34:44):**  in permaculture in my most commonly used language.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:34:48):**  We put additional swales and berms down slope from the upper, that Master Line that those  
**[0:34:57-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:34:57):**  additional swales accomplish our water movement and infiltration objectives.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:35:03):**  That's where we differ from the key line cultivation pattern is you can do whatever you want moving  
**[0:35:09-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:35:09):**  that water around on your property as long as one, it's legal to do so and two, you use  
**[0:35:14-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:35:14):**  structures that are approved by your USDA, your state, local government, federal government,  
**[0:35:20-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:35:20):**  etc.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:35:21):**  In doing Master Line system as described in water for any farm, it will comply with all  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:35:26):**  of those levels of regulation except in the places where they don't allow you to have  
**[0:35:30-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:35:30):**  a puddle standing around for longer than 15 seconds.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:35:34):**  Those are examples of extremes anyway.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:35:37):**  With that description and I know that you were talking about this just a little earlier  
**[0:35:40-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:35:40):**  about how the Master Line can serve as the pattern for the whole farm and solve that  
**[0:35:45-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:35:45):**  problem of the V-shaped fields that were endemic to the key line system on its own.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:35:52):**  With the Master Line system, you can create these parallel contour lines that are a real  
**[0:35:56-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:35:56):**  advantage for people who are working with larger machinery and the efficiencies of larger  
**[0:36:00-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:36:00):**  scale farms.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:36:01):**  Could you talk about how that works?  
**[0:36:05-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:36:05):**  One of the things I have to correct your language a little bit and that we'll be making parallels,  
**[0:36:12-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:36:12):**  yes, but they may not be contours.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:36:15):**  They might not be contours.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:36:18):**  If we go ahead and design a water management structure, USDA, it's called a terrace, permaculture,  
**[0:36:26-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:36:26):**  it's a swale or a diversion drain in key line language.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:36:30):**  If we put a diversion drain that we locate at that sweet spot in our landscape that connects  
**[0:36:36-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:36:36):**  all these different primary valleys, we can design a system now that's perfectly parallel  
**[0:36:43-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:36:43):**  across that landscape as we go down slope.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:36:49):**  What ends up happening is the terrace that we make, the subsequent terrace down, we strive  
**[0:36:54-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:36:54):**  to make alley width, which is the farmable interval between terrace structures, multiple  
**[0:37:00-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:37:00):**  of two times your equipment, so it's a very even number of passes as you're going across  
**[0:37:05-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:37:05):**  the landform.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:37:06):**  Now, let's say we're going to take four equipment widths down slope.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:37:12):**  First of all, we run a couple of quickie little equations that you can get from your local  
**[0:37:18-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:37:18):**  USDA office.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:37:19):**  One is the VI equation, then the other one is the HI equation, which basically for your  
**[0:37:24-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:37:24):**  soil type region and rainfall patterns gives you a safe maximum allowable alley width before  
**[0:37:30-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:37:30):**  erosion can be too problematic.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:37:34):**  You find what's the harmonized version of an alley that's not so wide that you'll increase  
**[0:37:42-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:37:42):**  erosion and yet still be multiples of two times your equipment width.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:37:47):**  Then we'll put in another swale, another terrace.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:37:50):**  That step will be parallel on the ground, but it may not be on contour and it may pitch  
**[0:37:58-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:37:58):**  the water in the opposite direction where you want to go.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:38:03):**  We'll go ahead and we'll install that parallel swale.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:38:06):**  Then if we want to move the water in a certain direction, we now adjust the bottom of the  
**[0:38:13-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:38:13):**  channel, the USDA terrace channel.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:38:16):**  We adjust the bottom of the swale on one end.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:38:20):**  That will allow the water to move towards that direction.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:38:23):**  You may end up with a parallel swale berm that the whole thing looks like it pitches  
**[0:38:30-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:38:30):**  to the left, but the bottom of the swale, the terrace channel, actually pitches to the  
**[0:38:34-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:38:34):**  right.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:38:35):**  We can actually create a system that's both parallel and gradient.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:38:41):**  It's parallel to the master line and it pitches in the direction that we want to go.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:38:46):**  We can continue those parallels down the field.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:38:49):**  What does happen though is we are imposing a regular form, a regular pattern onto an  
**[0:38:56-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:38:56):**  irregular landscape.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:38:59):**  What will happen, and a great example is to look at your hands, your fingers again.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:39:03):**  Notice the half moons under your fingernails and notice the creases on your knuckles.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:39:09):**  What will happen in a parallel master line system is the fact you will have odd spots  
**[0:39:15-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:39:15):**  out at the ridges.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:39:16):**  What's convenient about those little odd spots out on the ridges is we can have a terrace  
**[0:39:21-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:39:21):**  channel, a swale, that goes right to that little odd spot there.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:39:25):**  We can use that odd spot as an infiltration zone where the water from the swale, from  
**[0:39:31-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:39:31):**  the terrace channel, discharges in a sheet across the ridge form.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:39:37):**  Ridges are actually the driest shape on a property.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:39:42):**  We can use these terraces, the swales, to deliver the water to a ridge and then we can  
**[0:39:49-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:39:49):**  discharge water on that odd shape out on the tips of your fingers, on the ends of ridges.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:39:57):**  We can also use that spot as a place to plant some specialty crops.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:40:03):**  You can use it for planting butterfly habitat, wild pollinator habitat, etc., etc., or some  
**[0:40:11-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:40:11):**  sort of crop that has a higher value than if you're growing corn in these alleys, for  
**[0:40:17-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:40:17):**  example.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:40:18):**  A higher value crop can be grown in these little odd spots out in the corners.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:40:22):**  So the actual ag fields are made to be a lot more efficient because they're designed around  
**[0:40:29-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:40:29):**  your equipment and you make even number of passes across the fields.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:40:32):**  No point fields is what those funny odd shapes are called.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:40:36):**  No point fields in the cropping area unless you want them to be cropped.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:40:44):**  When the system is used, the parallel master line system is used, those odd spots and point  
**[0:40:49-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:40:49):**  fields will be out on the ridges primarily.  
**[0:40:55-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:40:55):**  You got to look at some diagrams to see how that rolls because we're trying to do this  
**[0:40:59-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:40:59):**  with words and it's tricky to describe land shapes and parallel and all that just using  
**[0:41:05-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:41:05):**  words.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:41:06):**  Yeah, it's always difficult to describe things like this, but you do a really good job of  
**[0:41:10-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:41:10):**  giving some examples, especially towards the end of the book in those drawings about how  
**[0:41:16-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:41:16):**  with the exact same landform someone could effectively put in a whole different range  
**[0:41:22-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:41:22):**  of contours and terraces and planning like this that basically serve more or less the  
**[0:41:29-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:41:29):**  same intent but can be different based on their own intentions and their goals for the  
**[0:41:33-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:41:33):**  place without having to deviate from this system and that was one of the parts that  
**[0:41:38-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:41:38):**  I found most useful because like you said, this can be difficult to explain in words  
**[0:41:42-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:41:42):**  and it's a lot of concepts until you see that drawn on the paper.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:41:47):**  But what is great about this system is just how flexible it is to anybody's goals for  
**[0:41:52-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:41:52):**  their property.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:41:54):**  I consider that to be somewhat of a compliment, so thank you about that.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:41:57):**  I just saw this book for the first time in printed form two days ago and that was exactly  
**[0:42:02-0:42:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:42:02):**  what caught my eyes, like oh my gosh, that alone if you just look at all those different  
**[0:42:07-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:42:07):**  examples is mind blowing.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:42:09):**  Well here's what's interesting, this is I already explained earlier about the difference  
**[0:42:14-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:42:14):**  in complexity of landforms.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:42:16):**  If you take the keyline cultivation pattern, it starts with a contour line from the key  
**[0:42:19-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:42:19):**  point.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:42:20):**  So that is one, let's introduce one into the equation.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:42:27):**  Now if we have a ridge on either side, let's use our throat where your collarbone comes  
**[0:42:31-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:42:31):**  together right at your Adam's apple as a key point and if we make a horseshoe shape at  
**[0:42:38-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:42:38):**  our throat, that's a key line.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:42:41):**  Then if we go out to our shoulder and make a horseshoe around our shoulder, that's a  
**[0:42:45-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:42:45):**  ridge reference line and then go make a horseshoe on the other shoulder, there's three design  
**[0:42:49-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:42:49):**  elements in there.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:42:51):**  If you go parallel up from the shoulder and then parallel down from your throat, that's  
**[0:42:56-0:42:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:42:56):**  the key line cultivation pattern.  
**[0:42:58-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:42:58):**  That's it.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:42:59):**  That's all that it ever is.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:43:01):**  However, with that same landform, we can actually by only using a swale that is A, perfectly  
**[0:43:08-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:43:08):**  on contour or B, pitched up ever so slightly 1% or less, which is 1 foot over 100 foot  
**[0:43:17-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:43:17):**  length or pitched down at 1% or less, only using those three different variables, two  
**[0:43:26-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:43:26):**  shoulder references, two ridge references and a key line reference by using those three  
**[0:43:32-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:43:32):**  lines as our reference lines and using up a little bit, down a little bit or perfectly  
**[0:43:38-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:43:38):**  on contour on the Masterline system.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:43:41):**  Just using those instructions, we have 739 different possibilities that we can come up  
**[0:43:46-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:43:46):**  with and that's if we just use a single pitch along any swale or terrace because your swale  
**[0:43:52-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:43:52):**  can go down at half a percent, it can then change and go perfectly on contour, it can  
**[0:43:59-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:43:59):**  go down at 2%, it can come slow down to 1%, you can adjust them all along the way.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:44:06):**  The number of different arrangements on a single landform is almost infinite.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:44:12):**  I haven't done the math on all this.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:44:14):**  It's almost infinite.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:44:15):**  No matter where you are, any farm, you can use these techniques as outlined in my book,  
**[0:44:21-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:44:21):**  the Masterline system, it'll work to accomplish your objectives.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:44:26):**  Yeah, I mean that's really what I was blown away by because I had always previously thought  
**[0:44:29-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:44:29):**  of Earthworks as being somewhat of a limited amount of options depending on the land that  
**[0:44:34-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:44:34):**  you've got and this really opened up the doors for where you place certain elements and how  
**[0:44:40-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:44:40):**  you can incorporate the same system for kind of small scale farms with a lot of diversity  
**[0:44:48-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:44:48):**  or to what's more common in the United States where people are growing just a limited amount  
**[0:44:53-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:44:53):**  of things and the convention has you working with large machinery and it really makes it  
**[0:44:58-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:44:58):**  applicable for that context too.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:45:01):**  So now we often think of Earthworks as being a very permanent thing.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:45:05):**  You put them in once and you more or less just go about the other aspects of design  
**[0:45:11-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:45:11):**  but I've seen in a couple of my own experiences on clients lands that they do need a little  
**[0:45:16-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:45:16):**  bit of maintenance.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:45:18):**  Can you talk about some of the maintenance of Earthwork elements that you've come across  
**[0:45:22-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:45:22):**  yourself, things like preventing sediment or backfill in swales or terraces or sealing  
**[0:45:27-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:45:27):**  and resealing ponds, correcting the grade or dredging ponds and things like that.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:45:32):**  What are some of the things that you can do to prevent excessive maintenance and what  
**[0:45:36-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:45:36):**  are the things you should kind of know that you need to look out for over a certain amount  
**[0:45:40-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:45:40):**  of time?  
**[0:45:41-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:45:41):**  Well, first and foremost is if you're in a humid environment at all that will support  
**[0:45:47-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:45:47):**  the growth of grass is to make sure that the Earthworks that you do are entirely grassed  
**[0:45:54-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:45:54):**  in well with a good dense sod.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:45:57):**  There are places where you won't be able to get a dense sod established and I understand  
**[0:46:02-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:46:02):**  that you're not going to be able to do it and the more arid and hot environments you  
**[0:46:06-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:46:06):**  won't be able to get that dense sod.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:46:08):**  So having a dense sod on it will help with any potential blowouts in the future.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:46:15):**  One of the things that also helps a lot to prevent blowouts is the fact that when we  
**[0:46:20-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:46:20):**  design a system, our terraces, and it's not described in the USDA language how we design  
**[0:46:25-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:46:25):**  terraces, the water conveyance portion of your swale, if we make that entirely below  
**[0:46:32-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:46:32):**  ground level and if we make it far enough below ground level that even in the most catastrophic  
**[0:46:38-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:46:38):**  storm it's the Earth itself that's holding the water back, you won't have a berm blowout  
**[0:46:45-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:46:45):**  because the water's down below ground level and then it moves somewhere else in the landscape  
**[0:46:50-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:46:50):**  a little further down.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:46:52):**  So that's just another unique feature of how we're doing, mostly doing our swales and berms.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:46:57):**  Well then to prevent inflow, if you're going to crop, if you're going to do row crops where  
**[0:47:03-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:47:03):**  tillage is used, and on New Forest Farm most people can go somewhere online and just search  
**[0:47:09-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:47:09):**  for that image and you'll see the aerial photograph.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:47:12):**  Like in the center of the photograph there's a triangle piece of land that's at the very  
**[0:47:20-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:47:20):**  top of the hill, there's a wind turbine tower up there now generating our electricity.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:47:25):**  But the first four parallel planting fields that you see were used as vegetable production  
**[0:47:35-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:47:35):**  for 15 plus years.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:47:38):**  And what happens as you have that exposed soil is you will get sediment, especially  
**[0:47:42-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:47:42):**  the finest sediment that will start to fill your swale channel.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:47:47):**  And what ended up happening on those fields as I used them over time, that soil creep  
**[0:47:53-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:47:53):**  eventually filled the entire swale and now is at the top of where the berm was, so the  
**[0:47:59-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:47:59):**  whole entire field over 20 years worth of use has shifted so the whole entire field  
**[0:48:05-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:48:05):**  is now a terrace form.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:48:07):**  Well what you can do is you can either maintain your swale channels, terrace channels, or  
**[0:48:13-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:48:13):**  you can choose not to, like on those fields I chose not to, and allow them to fill because  
**[0:48:18-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:48:18):**  you're still getting the water movement and a lot better infiltration because you're hopefully  
**[0:48:24-0:48:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:48:24):**  using good cover crops, encouraging good biological activity, and you're helping to deepen the  
**[0:48:31-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:48:31):**  topsoil layer by your land use practices and so you'll get better water infiltration on  
**[0:48:37-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:48:37):**  that anyways.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:48:40):**  Or you can go ahead and maintain your terrace channels, your swale channels, and clean them  
**[0:48:44-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:48:44):**  out every once in a while.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:48:45):**  I've worked on places where swales, terraces were put in back in the 1930s and they're  
**[0:48:53-0:48:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:48:53):**  still functioning perfectly well even when farmers have been tilling for the 70, 80 years  
**[0:48:58-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:48:58):**  since then.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:49:01):**  So these are structures that last a long time.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:49:03):**  However, one of the things that people don't understand is when you're doing it the way  
**[0:49:09-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:49:09):**  we do it, and I describe it in the book Water for Any Farm, is the direction of water flow  
**[0:49:15-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:49:15):**  in that terrace channel, the swale channel, is adjustable.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:49:22):**  By simply lowering the bottom of the channel on one side, you can make the water all move  
**[0:49:28-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:49:28):**  to the right, for example.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:49:29):**  Let's say you do that for five, six, seven, eight years and say, you know what, I actually  
**[0:49:32-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:49:32):**  want the water to go over to the left.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:49:34):**  You don't have to tear down the whole structure and start over.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:49:37):**  You just adjust the bottom of the channel and you remove material from the high side  
**[0:49:42-0:49:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:49:42):**  and you put it over on the low side.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:49:43):**  You can use a ditch witch, you can use a one bottom plow, two bottom plow to make a new  
**[0:49:48-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:49:48):**  channel in the bottom of the channel and you make it send the water in the opposite direction.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:49:52):**  So you can adjust these things year after year if you want.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:49:57):**  Yeah, that's another way that this book presents a lot of options that I hadn't considered  
**[0:50:01-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:50:01):**  before in the ways that you can use different types of machinery more than just like a keyline  
**[0:50:06-0:50:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:50:06):**  plow or a backhoe or some of the conventional ways we think of doing earthworks, but other  
**[0:50:12-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:50:12):**  farm machinery that can be leveraged to do this without having to buy more equipment.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:50:17):**  So one of the things that I really wanted to explore with you is that up until now we've  
**[0:50:21-0:50:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:50:21):**  been talking so much about contours on the land, but there's quite a few people who have  
**[0:50:26-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:50:26):**  really, really flat terrain.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:50:29):**  And I'm wondering, do earthworks and other water harvesting strategies apply for flat  
**[0:50:34-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:50:34):**  land or what would you recommend as a way to make the most of your water resources if  
**[0:50:39-0:50:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:50:39):**  your land completely lacks contour?  
**[0:50:41-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:50:41):**  Well, first of all, there is no such thing, period.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:50:46):**  There is no such thing as perfectly flat land.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:50:50):**  Even if it's been laser leveled to build a shopping mall, it's not perfectly flat.  
**[0:50:57-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:50:57):**  There is a pitch and a slope and a grade to it.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:50:59):**  So then the question becomes for the farmer using that, am I getting adequate soil hydration  
**[0:51:08-0:51:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:51:08):**  by not having any kind of earthworks on this property?  
**[0:51:12-0:51:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:51:12):**  And if you are, great.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:51:14):**  And if you don't expect to have a drought and never have gotten a drought, never will  
**[0:51:17-0:51:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:51:17):**  get a drought, great.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:51:18):**  Well, if however, you do have dry periods, it's in your best interest to capture the  
**[0:51:24-0:51:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:51:24):**  rain when it is here, move it where you want to move it, slow it down, let it soak in.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:51:29):**  And so therefore using some sort of channel, a swale, a terrace, maybe you want to design  
**[0:51:37-0:51:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:51:37):**  it just as an excavated channel, like a V-shape or a trapezoid-shaped channel or a curve-shaped  
**[0:51:42-0:51:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:51:42):**  channel with no berm at all, the water will still, any water when a rain event happens,  
**[0:51:49-0:51:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:51:49):**  a certain amount will soak in.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:51:50):**  It'll soak in.  
**[0:51:51-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:51:51):**  That's your infiltration rate.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:51:53):**  Well, any rain in excess of your infiltration rate is going to be on the surface and it's  
**[0:51:59-0:52:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:51:59):**  going to move, even on land that you may think is perfectly flat because it's not perfectly  
**[0:52:05-0:52:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:52:05):**  flat.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:52:06):**  So then as it starts to move, let's capture it in a channel and direct it to where we  
**[0:52:11-0:52:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:52:11):**  want it to go before we infiltrate it or discharge it.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:52:16):**  So even on flat land, an excavated channel is a useful tool to move water someplace or  
**[0:52:23-0:52:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:52:23):**  to soak water in someplace.  
**[0:52:25-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:52:25):**  And if you don't want them, you don't want them.  
**[0:52:27-0:52:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:52:27):**  And if you think that a swale, a terrace is going to be in the way, well, design it so  
**[0:52:34-0:52:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:52:34):**  it's not in the way or use your land in such a way that you harmonize with the water flow  
**[0:52:40-0:52:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:52:40):**  that you've now set up.  
**[0:52:42-0:52:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:52:42):**  If they're a useful practice anywhere, when you do it, do it right, do it well, and design  
**[0:52:51-0:52:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:52:51):**  things to accommodate your farming practices.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:52:53):**  And if you're doing stupid farming practices, change your practices.  
**[0:52:56-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:52:56):**  That's probably one of the biggest issues that I've seen with people who have swales,  
**[0:53:01-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:53:01):**  terrace systems.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:53:02):**  If you have complaints about it, it's usually because they're not using it as it was designed.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:53:07):**  A hammer is not a drill.  
**[0:53:10-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:53:10):**  If you try to use a hammer to make holes in a piece of wood, you can do it, but it's going  
**[0:53:15-0:53:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:53:15):**  to be a mess and it's going to take you a long time.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:53:18):**  Use the system as it's designed and it will be more efficient than the way you're probably  
**[0:53:23-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:53:23):**  using it right now because you're now optimizing your water and optimizing your equipment use,  
**[0:53:28-0:53:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:53:28):**  harmonizing the two.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:53:29):**  Yeah, that's really well said.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:53:31):**  And we've talked about all of these ways of capturing the water through alterations of  
**[0:53:36-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:53:36):**  the terrain, but you're always going to reach a limit if you're not trying to also improve  
**[0:53:41-0:53:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:53:41):**  the amount of water that your terrain can infiltrate on its own for the quality of the  
**[0:53:46-0:53:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:53:46):**  soil.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:53:47):**  So let's talk a little bit about building soil as a harvesting strategy and how creating  
**[0:53:52-0:53:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:53:52):**  the conditions for life can speed up this process from one that takes geological time  
**[0:53:57-0:54:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:53:57):**  as it would naturally do on its own to one that can be achieved in a few decades with  
**[0:54:02-0:54:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:54:02):**  the right interventions.  
**[0:54:03-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:54:03):**  What we're not doing is we're not creating topsoil per se from the top up.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:54:09):**  We're not applying extra compost or extra fill that we brought in from somewhere else.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:54:13):**  What we're doing is we are converting the existing subsoil, converting that into topsoil.  
**[0:54:20-0:54:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:54:20):**  And that's almost a quote right out of P.A.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:54:23):**  Yeoman's Water for Every Farm.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:54:26):**  And that is one of the overall design objectives.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:54:29):**  First of all, by increasing our topsoil depth, that means we're increasing the organic matter  
**[0:54:36-0:54:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:54:36):**  content in most cases, not if you're in peat or muck, which is already high organic matter.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:54:42):**  In most agricultural soils, if we increase the depth of the topsoil, we're increasing  
**[0:54:48-0:54:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:54:48):**  the organic matter content, which is carbon that came directly out of the atmosphere and  
**[0:54:53-0:54:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:54:53):**  put into the soil.  
**[0:54:54-0:54:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:54:54):**  And I forget what the number was, but it's less than like a couple of percent.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:54:59):**  We raise on all the agricultural land worldwide, if we raise soil organic matters just a couple  
**[0:55:05-0:55:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:55:05):**  of percent, we eliminate any kind of excess carbon.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:55:10):**  We take atmospheric carbon levels back down to pre-industrial levels.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:55:14):**  How we do that is we increase the biological activity.  
**[0:55:18-0:55:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:55:18):**  Life needs air, it needs water and some sort of food.  
**[0:55:24-0:55:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:55:24):**  And so if we go ahead and we design the system to manage our water, infiltrate it where we  
**[0:55:30-0:55:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:55:30):**  want to infiltrate it, then use a perennial cover, say pasture mix, whatever your local  
**[0:55:36-0:55:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:55:36):**  pasture mix du jour is.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:55:39):**  One of the tools that's very useful, P.A. Yeoman's talks about a Yeoman's plow or a  
**[0:55:45-0:55:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:55:45):**  chisel plow.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:55:46):**  Don't use an American style chisel plow when doing this.  
**[0:55:48-0:55:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:55:48):**  Use a subsoiler or a mole plow, a deep shank ripper or my neighbor Paul Cooner calls it  
**[0:55:57-0:55:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:55:57):**  the hook.  
**[0:55:58-0:56:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:55:58):**  So use a hook just to drag through the soil.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:56:02):**  It cuts a slot in the soil and it shatters a little bit on either side, makes cracks  
**[0:56:06-0:56:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:56:06):**  and fissures so that when the next rain comes, water will easily penetrate that slot and  
**[0:56:12-0:56:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:56:12):**  then it'll start to seep sideways.  
**[0:56:14-0:56:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:56:14):**  It'll whip sideways through the fractures that are made by this tool.  
**[0:56:19-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:56:19):**  It doesn't plow the ground up and make it turn black.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:56:22):**  Just make these little lines, these little slots in your fields.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:56:26):**  If you're using this tool, the subsoiler parallel to your your soil system, whatever direction  
**[0:56:33-0:56:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:56:33):**  you've pitched the water, wherever you've sent it to, it enhances that and all the water  
**[0:56:37-0:56:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:56:37):**  that falls in the slots goes in that direction.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:56:40):**  So now what we've got is we've got our major water management structures, the swales and  
**[0:56:44-0:56:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:56:44):**  the berms that are capturing any kind of overflow that came off of the crop fields.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:56:50):**  Then in the crop fields, we're using the subsoiler to make sure that more water infiltrates.  
**[0:56:56-0:57:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:56:56):**  When that water infiltrates, you have moist soil all the way down as that water soaks  
**[0:57:00-0:57:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:57:00):**  in and continues to go down into the into the water table.  
**[0:57:05-0:57:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:57:05):**  As it's sinking, it's pulling air into the slot behind it.  
**[0:57:08-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:57:08):**  You've got water and air.  
**[0:57:10-0:57:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:57:10):**  The soil life will wake up and the soil life is now feeding off of the sugars exuded from  
**[0:57:17-0:57:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:57:17):**  the roots of plants.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:57:19):**  Any sloughing of roots from plants as you clip roots or graze the tops of the grasses  
**[0:57:25-0:57:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:57:25):**  or mow them.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:57:26):**  Now you have water, air and food for the soil life and you're creating topsoil.  
**[0:57:32-0:57:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:57:32):**  That plus those slots create a little bit of a loosened zone and plant roots really  
**[0:57:39-0:57:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:57:39):**  proliferate in there.  
**[0:57:40-0:57:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:57:40):**  When you first start doing this in the early years as you use the subsoiler in your system,  
**[0:57:47-0:57:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:57:47):**  you'll notice a green line where you drag the subsoiler.  
**[0:57:52-0:57:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:57:52):**  It almost looks like a nitrogen response.  
**[0:57:55-0:57:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:57:55):**  You get this band of green, these green strips going through your field.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:57:59):**  As the soil continues to improve over time, that'll lessen to a certain degree.  
**[0:58:04-0:58:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:58:04):**  You won't see that response so much.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:58:06):**  But you're still getting that air and that water deep into the soil right where you need  
**[0:58:12-0:58:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:58:12):**  it.  
**[0:58:13-0:58:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:58:13):**  Now there's some folks that have been telling me that in the arid regions, this is where  
**[0:58:17-0:58:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:58:17):**  I've encountered more people saying this, you don't want to make your slots deep because  
**[0:58:22-0:58:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:58:22):**  then the water will go down below root level fast and then you won't be able to utilize  
**[0:58:27-0:58:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:58:27):**  it because your plant roots are so shallow.  
**[0:58:29-0:58:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:58:29):**  It's like, well, when you use a subsoiler, it cuts a slot, yes.  
**[0:58:33-0:58:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:58:33):**  Well, then the slot collapses a little bit behind itself.  
**[0:58:36-0:58:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:58:36):**  It's still a very loosened zone and when rain comes, it does fill up that slot.  
**[0:58:41-0:58:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:58:41):**  But it's got any kind of rainfall, even if it's a shallow amount of rainfall, it has  
**[0:58:45-0:58:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:58:45):**  to go down and it wets the sides of that slot on the way down.  
**[0:58:49-0:58:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:58:49):**  And so it gets to your plant roots.  
**[0:58:52-0:58:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:58:52):**  And so I'm not really convinced that you have to make the slots shallow at first and then  
**[0:58:58-0:59:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:58:58):**  deeper later on as your roots develop more.  
**[0:59:02-0:59:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:59:02):**  In my situation, the clay soil is so hard when I first started farming there that my  
**[0:59:08-0:59:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:59:08):**  subsoiler would only go down eight inches because he just wouldn't go any further because  
**[0:59:11-0:59:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:59:11):**  it was such a hard, heavy, thick clay.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:59:14):**  But as the years went by and the roots continued to penetrate, the soil life came to life,  
**[0:59:21-0:59:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:59:21):**  I could put the hook, the subsoil goes deeper and deeper and deeper until now I can actually  
**[0:59:27-0:59:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:59:27):**  pull a two shank yeoman's plow, which theoretically you need a 50 horsepower.  
**[0:59:32-0:59:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:59:32):**  I never used to be able to pull even a one shank subsoiler, American subsoiler with my  
**[0:59:38-0:59:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:59:38):**  tractor more than eight inches deep.  
**[0:59:40-0:59:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:59:40):**  Well, now I can pull a two shank yeoman's plow subsoiler two and a half feet deep and  
**[0:59:46-0:59:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:59:46):**  I pull it with a 40 horse tractor.  
**[0:59:48-0:59:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:59:48):**  That's how much the soil has softened up and loosened up.  
**[0:59:51-0:59:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:59:51):**  And so if you've got an increased topsoil depth, you're going to get increased crop  
**[0:59:56-0:59:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:59:56):**  yields.  
**[0:59:57-1:00:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=0:59:57):**  If you have increased water storage capacity because of all the organic matter, that's  
**[1:00:01-1:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:00:01):**  the soil's ability to soak up all this rain and not be wet is you have more ability in  
**[1:00:09-1:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:00:09):**  that soil to store water and not be wet.  
**[1:00:13-1:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:00:13):**  That's happened through time.  
**[1:00:14-1:00:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:00:14):**  Your crop yields go up, your drought stress goes down because you're storing more water  
**[1:00:19-1:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:00:19):**  in the soil, because your plants are able to access it all throughout the growing season.  
**[1:00:23-1:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:00:23):**  Even if it's just a short dry period, your plants really won't suffer at all because  
**[1:00:29-1:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:00:29):**  the soil, the water is held right down there in the soil where they can get it.  
**[1:00:33-1:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:00:33):**  So the subsoiler, mole plow, deep tine ripper, whatever you want to call that yeoman's plow,  
**[1:00:40-1:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:00:40):**  use whichever works in your context.  
**[1:00:43-1:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:00:43):**  Nice.  
**[1:00:44-1:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:00:44):**  Now, you mentioned earlier when we were speaking about these increasingly intense events where  
**[1:00:51-1:00:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:00:51):**  no amount of planning or soil amendments are going to be able to accommodate the amount  
**[1:00:58-1:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:00:58):**  of water that you have to deal with.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:00:59):**  And I know that you talked about some stories in the book, even in just the last couple  
**[1:01:03-1:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:01:03):**  of years, where you received water events that you had to deal with in a way that you  
**[1:01:08-1:01:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:01:08):**  hadn't up until now.  
**[1:01:09-1:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:01:09):**  And many of us consider yours as being the farm as an example of a fairly mature system  
**[1:01:14-1:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:01:14):**  well designed to make the best use of water that it can, though I'm sure you're always  
**[1:01:18-1:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:01:18):**  making improvements down the line.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:01:20):**  And you still had to react to an emergency and get the water off of the different elements  
**[1:01:28-1:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:01:28):**  on your farm faster.  
**[1:01:30-1:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:01:30):**  Could you talk about, first of all, when you decided to make that call, when you had to  
**[1:01:34-1:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:01:34):**  really open up the drainage and what you did and how your system was able to accommodate  
**[1:01:41-1:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:01:41):**  that with the amendments as it came up?  
**[1:01:43-1:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:01:43):**  Right.  
**[1:01:44-1:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:01:44):**  So, in Wisconsin, Southwest Wisconsin, we've had, last year, 2018, was record amounts of  
**[1:01:50-1:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:01:50):**  rain, more than two times the historic average rain.  
**[1:01:56-1:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:01:56):**  And then this year, we're only two times the normal historic average rain.  
**[1:02:01-1:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:02:01):**  So when you build a water retention landscape, you will retain water.  
**[1:02:06-1:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:02:06):**  Well, in the uppermost fields where I've been growing annual crops, I've been selling wholesale  
**[1:02:13-1:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:02:13):**  organic produce for 25 years.  
**[1:02:17-1:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:02:17):**  It was too wet to actually get into the fields at a reasonable time in order for me to get  
**[1:02:22-1:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:02:22):**  a crop.  
**[1:02:23-1:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:02:23):**  And so I'm going to have to ask everybody to imagine a rectangle as if you're looking  
**[1:02:29-1:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:02:29):**  at a bathroom mirror that's a rectangle shape.  
**[1:02:32-1:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:02:32):**  If the top of the edge of the mirror and the lower edge of the mirror are swales, terraces,  
**[1:02:37-1:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:02:37):**  whatever, and if they move the water one way or the other, left or the right, it's up to  
**[1:02:42-1:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:02:42):**  you, your design.  
**[1:02:45-1:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:02:45):**  When you normally subsoil and use the field, you'll go parallel to that, and it helps with  
**[1:02:50-1:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:02:50):**  that water distribution pattern.  
**[1:02:51-1:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:02:51):**  Well, once your soil is fully charged, it is now fully hydrated, water starts to soak  
**[1:02:57-1:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:02:57):**  down into the subsoil.  
**[1:02:59-1:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:02:59):**  Well, when you continue to get more water than can soak in, you fill all your ponds,  
**[1:03:07-1:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:03:07):**  and that field is still too wet.  
**[1:03:09-1:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:03:09):**  Instead of plowing or subsoiling parallel to those swale lines, if you start at the  
**[1:03:16-1:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:03:16):**  upper right-hand corner and you go diagonally down to the lower left corner, that actually  
**[1:03:23-1:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:03:23):**  will be slightly downhill to the left.  
**[1:03:25-1:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:03:25):**  And so now you can cultivate your fields diagonally across that way, and it'll spread the water  
**[1:03:31-1:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:03:31):**  out to the furthest edge of the field.  
**[1:03:35-1:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:03:35):**  So then you put it out onto your farm access lanes or if there's other ponds or storage  
**[1:03:40-1:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:03:40):**  structures there.  
**[1:03:41-1:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:03:41):**  And you don't have to make it a straight diagonal line.  
**[1:03:43-1:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:03:43):**  Mine ended up being curves.  
**[1:03:45-1:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:03:45):**  So what I ended up doing is with using a two-bottom plow is I took a laser level out, and I tried  
**[1:03:51-1:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:03:51):**  to find the longest possible gentle gradient line across that field, and I put a drainage  
**[1:03:59-1:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:03:59):**  ditch through the middle of my field going to the left on that rectangle that we're looking  
**[1:04:04-1:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:04:04):**  at.  
**[1:04:05-1:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:04:05):**  Well, then what happened is at the lower right-hand corner of this mirror that we're looking at,  
**[1:04:09-1:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:04:09):**  I breached that berm and allow the water to go back to what it used to do and flow down  
**[1:04:17-1:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:04:17):**  the primary valleys to flow away.  
**[1:04:20-1:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:04:20):**  And in my upper fields where I was doing annual crops, that allowed those fields to dry out  
**[1:04:27-1:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:04:27):**  somewhat, but I never let the water exit the farm because further down below it's going  
**[1:04:32-1:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:04:32):**  into hazelnuts and it's going into grazing areas.  
**[1:04:36-1:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:04:36):**  And I had it made sure it went down there.  
**[1:04:38-1:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:04:38):**  When it hit the next, like the third swale and berm down, I didn't breach that primary  
**[1:04:44-1:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:04:44):**  valley.  
**[1:04:45-1:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:04:45):**  And then it would get distributed to the ponds or the infiltration zones for that particular  
**[1:04:49-1:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:04:49):**  swale system.  
**[1:04:51-1:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:04:51):**  So when you have seriously excess rainfall and you're not able to utilize those fields  
**[1:04:57-1:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:04:57):**  because they're too wet, you can simply breach the primary valley crossing and then you can  
**[1:05:03-1:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:05:03):**  cultivate in the direction that makes the water go slightly downhill off the field in  
**[1:05:09-1:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:05:09):**  question.  
**[1:05:10-1:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:05:10):**  And so it's easily quote unquote drained, which I really don't want to encourage people  
**[1:05:15-1:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:05:15):**  to drain soil because you need that water.  
**[1:05:19-1:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:05:19):**  However, in our case right here, we've had four years worth of rain in two years.  
**[1:05:26-1:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:05:26):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't mean we're going to go four years without rain.  
**[1:05:29-1:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:05:29):**  But if it does do that, that soil is fully hydrated.  
**[1:05:35-1:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:05:35):**  It's holding the maximum amount of water that it possibly can in its current condition without  
**[1:05:41-1:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:05:41):**  being waterlogged.  
**[1:05:43-1:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:05:43):**  And the remarkable part is even in this emergency, you didn't have to go in and use a big backhoe  
**[1:05:48-1:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:05:48):**  or something to breach those berms.  
**[1:05:50-1:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:05:50):**  You were able to do it just with a shovel, no?  
**[1:05:53-1:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:05:53):**  Yeah.  
**[1:05:54-1:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:05:54):**  Well, in the annual crop fields I did on the upper slopes, I did it with the front end  
**[1:05:58-1:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:05:58):**  loader on my tractor.  
**[1:06:01-1:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:06:01):**  So it was pretty simple.  
**[1:06:02-1:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:06:02):**  Nice.  
**[1:06:03-1:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:06:03):**  So look, we've covered so many things and this is still just a fraction of what you've  
**[1:06:07-1:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:06:07):**  gone through in the book in much greater detail, but I know that you're also coming out with  
**[1:06:12-1:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:06:12):**  a technical manual to accompany the book.  
**[1:06:14-1:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:06:14):**  Could you tell us a little bit about what's going to be in there to help people to understand  
**[1:06:18-1:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:06:18):**  these concepts better?  
**[1:06:19-1:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:06:19):**  Well, so this book, Water for Any Farm, was written to be read by anybody and understood  
**[1:06:26-1:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:06:26):**  and give you these visual images that any farmer, homesteader, rancher can figure out  
**[1:06:32-1:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:06:32):**  and go, oh, okay, yeah, I can do that and do it safely and effectively and not create  
**[1:06:37-1:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:06:37):**  more problems than you already have right now.  
**[1:06:40-1:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:06:40):**  The technical manual goes through in almost painful detail a lot of the engineering diagrams  
**[1:06:51-1:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:06:51):**  and specifications and it goes through all of the USDA language and it takes a swale  
**[1:06:58-1:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:06:58):**  and permaculture language, for example, and uses USDA language to describe every single  
**[1:07:03-1:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:07:03):**  part of that swale using USDA language and flip-flop that.  
**[1:07:07-1:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:07:07):**  It uses swale language to describe USDA terrace practices and it does it in serious analytical  
**[1:07:16-1:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:07:16):**  detail.  
**[1:07:17-1:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:07:17):**  It also includes in there, I mentioned already the VI equation and the HI equation.  
**[1:07:23-1:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:07:23):**  If you're going to be doing this on your farm, you don't necessarily have to use the engineering  
**[1:07:30-1:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:07:30):**  mathematics to put in a system.  
**[1:07:32-1:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:07:32):**  However, it's in your best interest to do your homework.  
**[1:07:35-1:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:07:35):**  Do your homework.  
**[1:07:36-1:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:07:36):**  What are the rainfalls from your sky?  
**[1:07:38-1:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:07:38):**  What is the infiltration rate for your soil types if everything was working well?  
**[1:07:43-1:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:07:43):**  What are the actual infiltration rates of your soil now because it's probably been farmed  
**[1:07:46-1:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:07:46):**  incorrectly for who knows how long it has been?  
**[1:07:50-1:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:07:50):**  Then how wide of a crop alley should I have in order to minimize the erosion on my property?  
**[1:07:59-1:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:07:59):**  Well then how big, how deep should the terrace channel be?  
**[1:08:04-1:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:08:04):**  Because I will know, say this one acre field here in a six inch rain, there's what's called  
**[1:08:10-1:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:08:10):**  a design storm event.  
**[1:08:13-1:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:08:13):**  What you do is you use the USDA number for, it's a ten year, it's a ten year storm event,  
**[1:08:24-1:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:08:24):**  is what all the USDA terrace systems are designed around so that your channels and your terrace  
**[1:08:31-1:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:08:31):**  berm can hold that ten year design storm.  
**[1:08:36-1:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:08:36):**  We typically design to hold a twenty five year rain event.  
**[1:08:41-1:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:08:41):**  So what are those numbers?  
**[1:08:43-1:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:08:43):**  What is that number on your property?  
**[1:08:45-1:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:08:45):**  How do you do the calculations to figure out how deep should my swales be?  
**[1:08:49-1:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:08:49):**  How big should the berm be?  
**[1:08:51-1:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:08:51):**  How wide should the crop alleys be?  
**[1:08:53-1:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:08:53):**  And okay, now we're going to make ponds, we're going to make discharges if we're going to  
**[1:08:57-1:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:08:57):**  make a level sill discharge.  
**[1:08:58-1:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:08:58):**  How long should it be?  
**[1:09:00-1:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:09:00):**  Does it need to have a sedimentation pool built on the upstream side of it?  
**[1:09:05-1:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:09:05):**  So the technical manual has all of the technical details in there and if, I'm not trying to  
**[1:09:12-1:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:09:12):**  prevent people from buying it, but those people who get bored to tears with technical reality  
**[1:09:21-1:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:09:21):**  may not find it an enjoyable read, but it will be an informative read and it will help  
**[1:09:26-1:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:09:26):**  you to design your swale and berm system to comply with USDA and Army Corps of Engineer  
**[1:09:34-1:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:09:34):**  codes, which we really should do that.  
**[1:09:37-1:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:09:37):**  Don't go out here and be a rebel and just kind of move dirt all over the place without  
**[1:09:41-1:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:09:41):**  finding out what the federal regulations that apply to you, the state, the local, the county,  
**[1:09:47-1:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:09:47):**  the water management district, what are the rules that apply to you?  
**[1:09:51-1:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:09:51):**  How can you comply with all those laws, whether you like them or not, how can you comply with  
**[1:09:55-1:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:09:55):**  those laws and still accomplish your water management objectives on your property?  
**[1:10:00-1:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:10:00):**  So that's what the technical details on the technical manual goes into.  
**[1:10:04-1:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:10:04):**  It's all black and white, no color photographs, lots of engineering looking diagrams, numbers  
**[1:10:09-1:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:10:09):**  and equations.  
**[1:10:10-1:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:10:10):**  It's a beautiful, it's a thing to behold.  
**[1:10:13-1:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:10:13):**  Excellent.  
**[1:10:14-1:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:10:14):**  Hey, I mean that's really important stuff, especially when doing it on the scale and  
**[1:10:17-1:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:10:17):**  with the urgency that it needs to be done in the days and years to come.  
**[1:10:22-1:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:10:22):**  I for one have been looking into and researching water harvesting systems, earthworks, permaculture  
**[1:10:29-1:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:10:29):**  techniques for a long time.  
**[1:10:31-1:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:10:31):**  And for what it's worth, I got a ton out of this.  
**[1:10:33-1:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:10:33):**  I've never had this explained in such a way that really answered all of the questions  
**[1:10:37-1:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:10:37):**  and the doubts that I've had.  
**[1:10:39-1:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:10:39):**  And the points at which I thought some of previous systems and pedagogies were somewhat  
**[1:10:44-1:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:10:44):**  limited.  
**[1:10:45-1:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:10:45):**  I really recommend this to anybody who still has some questions about water harvesting  
**[1:10:49-1:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:10:49):**  and earthworks methods.  
**[1:10:51-1:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:10:51):**  So before I let you go, Mark, could you tell us about some of the other resources and the  
**[1:10:57-1:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:10:57):**  release date for the technical manual as well as ways that our listeners can get in contact  
**[1:11:02-1:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:11:02):**  with you and your team?  
**[1:11:03-1:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:11:03):**  Sure.  
**[1:11:04-1:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:11:04):**  First of all, this book, Water for Any Farm, those of you who only have like a sixth grade  
**[1:11:11-1:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:11:11):**  reading level, you'd be all right because that's all I can write in is at the sixth  
**[1:11:14-1:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:11:14):**  grade reading level.  
**[1:11:16-1:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:11:16):**  It's an easy read.  
**[1:11:17-1:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:11:17):**  It's more narrative.  
**[1:11:18-1:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:11:18):**  This is what I've done.  
**[1:11:20-1:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:11:20):**  It's more of an aw shucks kind of perspective, whereas a technical manual will be a lot more  
**[1:11:25-1:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:11:25):**  precise language and it's not as enjoyable to read.  
**[1:11:29-1:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:11:29):**  So don't worry about Water for Any Farm.  
**[1:11:33-1:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:11:33):**  It's easy to read.  
**[1:11:34-1:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:11:34):**  It's fun to read.  
**[1:11:35-1:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:11:35):**  Some other resources that you might want to look into, look up the USDA code.  
**[1:11:41-1:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:11:41):**  Just do an internet search for, I think, I believe it's code 600, which describes terraces  
**[1:11:47-1:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:11:47):**  and the use of terraces.  
**[1:11:49-1:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:11:49):**  And you'll see right up front from their definition, their wordy definition of a terrace, it's  
**[1:11:55-1:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:11:55):**  a swale and a berm.  
**[1:11:57-1:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:11:57):**  Then learn their language for what you're doing.  
**[1:12:01-1:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:12:01):**  So look up USDA code 600, look up whatever the USDA code, I think it's 300 or 330 on  
**[1:12:08-1:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:12:08):**  contour farming.  
**[1:12:10-1:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:12:10):**  Look up the USDA codes online.  
**[1:12:12-1:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:12:12):**  It's all free online.  
**[1:12:14-1:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:12:14):**  The USDA code 590 for making ponds and whatever the one is for grassed waterways.  
**[1:12:21-1:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:12:21):**  And with that right there, it's really cool.  
**[1:12:24-1:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:12:24):**  They tell you how to do it and what to do in extraordinary detail.  
**[1:12:28-1:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:12:28):**  Well, when designing a more complex system that has multiple elements, multiple of those  
**[1:12:35-1:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:12:35):**  elements from terraces and swales and berms and discharges and level sills and ponds,  
**[1:12:39-1:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:12:39):**  blah, blah, blah, if you want some kind of help and assistance, you can contact Restoration  
**[1:12:44-1:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:12:44):**  Agriculture Development, restorationag.com.  
**[1:12:49-1:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:12:49):**  And then what we'll do is we can come out and do a basic site assessment and come up  
**[1:12:54-1:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:12:54):**  with an overall strategy of this is what you can do.  
**[1:12:57-1:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:12:57):**  This is what your current site does.  
**[1:13:00-1:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:13:00):**  This is a potential direction you can go in that's based on the natural plant community  
**[1:13:04-1:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:13:04):**  types of your area.  
**[1:13:07-1:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:13:07):**  Then we can come in later on and plant the agroforestry system because what we do is  
**[1:13:12-1:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:13:12):**  we use the swales and berms, the terraces as the pattern that now tells us where to  
**[1:13:17-1:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:13:17):**  put rows of trees.  
**[1:13:20-1:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:13:20):**  And we focus primarily on crop trees.  
**[1:13:23-1:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:13:23):**  And we don't necessarily grow our crop trees, chestnuts, for example, or apples.  
**[1:13:26-1:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:13:26):**  We don't grow them as an orchard.  
**[1:13:28-1:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:13:28):**  We grow them as a tree.  
**[1:13:29-1:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:13:29):**  We kind of let them do their thing.  
**[1:13:32-1:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:13:32):**  And as a bonus, we get the benefit of fruits or nuts as an extra yield.  
**[1:13:39-1:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:13:39):**  And it does not interfere with our cropping in the alleys in between.  
**[1:13:44-1:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:13:44):**  So those plants that we use, the trees that we use, come from the Forest Agriculture Nursery  
**[1:13:50-1:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:13:50):**  at forestag.com, F-O-R-E-S-T-A-G.com.  
**[1:13:56-1:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:13:56):**  And we're a networked nursery of a number of small, independent, accelerated, woody  
**[1:14:04-1:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:14:04):**  crop plant breeders.  
**[1:14:07-1:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:14:07):**  And we have folks in most regions of the USA that they're creating land races of the specific  
**[1:14:14-1:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:14:14):**  crop trees with the intention of having them grow in systems with heavy competition from  
**[1:14:20-1:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:14:20):**  pasture grasses, weeds, et cetera, and minimal inputs as in no fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides,  
**[1:14:28-1:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:14:28):**  et cetera, and high yields simultaneously.  
**[1:14:30-1:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:14:30):**  So my personal three that I focus on the most at my own breeding site are chestnuts and  
**[1:14:38-1:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:14:38):**  hazelnuts and pine nuts.  
**[1:14:39-1:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:14:39):**  The pine nuts that I use are Korean pine.  
**[1:14:43-1:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:14:43):**  We also have access to breeders who are working with pinyon pine, Italian pine, Siberian pine.  
**[1:14:51-1:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:14:51):**  We've got folks doing walnut.  
**[1:14:55-1:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:14:55):**  Believe it or not, we've got walnuts that have survived in Wisconsin and are producing  
**[1:14:59-1:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:14:59):**  walnuts like the California walnut, not just black walnut.  
**[1:15:03-1:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:15:03):**  And we've got folks that are working on pecan as well.  
**[1:15:06-1:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:15:06):**  The idea here is to have seedling plants, not necessarily grafted plants, because genetic  
**[1:15:13-1:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:15:13):**  diversity is actually an advantage in a natural system.  
**[1:15:18-1:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:15:18):**  And when we put a genetic diversity out there, if the weather weirds on us, it goes strange  
**[1:15:23-1:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:15:23):**  here and there, we will have in our plantings the right genetics to go forward, and then  
**[1:15:30-1:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:15:30):**  we continue to replant and select based on reality.  
**[1:15:33-1:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:15:33):**  We already talked about designing around reality.  
**[1:15:36-1:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:15:36):**  We're growing woody crops, food for people based on reality.  
**[1:15:41-1:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:15:41):**  Plants are a reality in the world.  
**[1:15:44-1:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:15:44):**  They really are.  
**[1:15:45-1:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:15:45):**  We don't have to fight against them with poisons.  
**[1:15:47-1:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:15:47):**  We're breeding right along with them for resistance.  
**[1:15:50-1:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:15:50):**  Diseases are natural and normal.  
**[1:15:52-1:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:15:52):**  They're not a disaster, something that happens to your plants that you have to fight against.  
**[1:15:57-1:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:15:57):**  We breed right along with it for natural resistance, and so on and so on and so on.  
**[1:16:03-1:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:16:03):**  We're breeding actively forward the varieties that will survive our site with the way reality  
**[1:16:11-1:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:16:11):**  is.  
**[1:16:12-1:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:16:12):**  So if you're ordering plants from Forest Ag, for example, we also have the ability now  
**[1:16:17-1:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:16:17):**  to target you.  
**[1:16:19-1:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:16:19):**  If you just order Chinese chestnuts, for example, and you're in Maine, will we choose from our  
**[1:16:26-1:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:16:26):**  breeders who are up further north with similar soil types instead of sending you genetics  
**[1:16:30-1:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:16:30):**  front that are thriving down in Oklahoma, for example?  
**[1:16:33-1:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:16:33):**  Yeah, perfect, man.  
**[1:16:35-1:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:16:35):**  These are some fantastic resources.  
**[1:16:37-1:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:16:37):**  I'm really hoping that this gets out there even further.  
**[1:16:40-1:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:16:40):**  I'm very excited and love the passion that you speak with and all of the great work that's  
**[1:16:44-1:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:16:44):**  come up.  
**[1:16:45-1:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:16:45):**  I mean, even in just the short two years since I talked with you, seeing how much this has  
**[1:16:49-1:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:16:49):**  advanced is just really great to see.  
**[1:16:53-1:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:16:53):**  So Mark, thank you so much for taking the time to explain this in greater detail and  
**[1:16:58-1:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:16:58):**  to let us know about your work and your book.  
**[1:17:00-1:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:17:00):**  I really hope we can do another follow up and continue to catch up as these things progress.  
**[1:17:05-1:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:17:05):**  We will.  
**[1:17:06-1:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:17:06):**  And remember this, all of you who are listening.  
**[1:17:09-1:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:17:09):**  We are living in fascinating times.  
**[1:17:12-1:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:17:12):**  You and I, all of us are being called to go above and beyond what we ever thought was  
**[1:17:16-1:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:17:16):**  possible and there's baggage from the past that we have to just ignore because there  
**[1:17:21-1:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/mark-shepard-water-for-any-farm/#t=1:17:21):**  are techniques and tools that we've been taught and drummed into us over and over and over

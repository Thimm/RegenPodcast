**[0:00:00-0:00:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:03-0:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:00:03):**  Here we dive deep into the worlds of permaculture, natural building, and regenerative living  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:00:07):**  as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself, for your community,  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:00:12):**  and for this beautiful planet that we all share.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:00:14):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I have a great session for you in this week's  
**[0:00:18-0:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:00:18):**  episode, so let's jump right in!  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:00:30):**  Are you looking for the best resources to help you build a regenerative lifestyle?  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:00:34):**  New Society Publishers has been a leader in sustainable publishing for over 30 years.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:00:39):**  They publish good news and solutions for individuals and organizations seeking to change their  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:00:43):**  lives so that they may change the world for the better.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:00:47):**  Their company mandate goes far beyond the single bottom line of profit.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:00:50):**  They care deeply not only about what they publish, but also how they do business.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:00:55):**  They believe in the authors that they take on and the works that they bring to the marketplace.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:00:59):**  From sustainable living to progressive parenting, New Society Publishers has the books you need  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:01:04):**  to help build a better world.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:01:06):**  Buy your print and ebooks online at www.newsociety.com or at fine bookstores near you.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:01:14):**  I don't always have the pleasure of interviewing my guests in person, but I was fortunate this  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:01:19):**  time to be able to sit down with Zach Lokes, permaculture teacher and author of the book  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:01:23):**  The Permaculture Market Garden, last week while he's down here in Guatemala, co-teaching  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:01:27):**  a PDC with Abundant Edge and Atitlan Organics.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:01:31):**  In this episode, we had the chance to talk about a lot of subjects that we missed on  
**[0:01:34-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:01:34):**  my first interview with him back in season 1.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:01:37):**  We explore the topics of putting culture back in permaculture, and finding ways of sharing  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:01:41):**  and communicating in other forms such as art and music.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:01:45):**  There's also a surprise right around the 23 minute mark of this episode, something that  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:01:50):**  you're unlikely to hear from me ever again, but you can always find on Zach Lokes' MC  
**[0:01:55-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:01:55):**  Ecology Instagram page.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:01:57):**  So check that out for something that you've never heard on this podcast before.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:02:01):**  Later in this session, Zach also talks about the challenges and advantages of the high  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:02:05):**  tropical climate that we have, and how some of the difficulties might be managed creatively.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:02:10):**  For anyone looking to get to know Zach better, you can hear more about him and his background  
**[0:02:14-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:02:14):**  in our first interview on Market Gardening from season 1.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:02:17):**  And of course there's a link to that episode right in the show notes on the website.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:02:21):**  So let's jump back now to my little porch overlooking the lake and catch up with Zach.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:02:24):**  All right, I'm here with my good friend and colleague Zach Lokes again.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:02:28):**  If anybody is interested in hearing his background, you could go back to the initial interview  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:02:33):**  that I did with him in season 1.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:02:36):**  But how are you doing?  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:02:37):**  We're here in the flesh in Guatemala helping to teach a permaculture design course with  
**[0:02:42-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:02:42):**  us and Atitlan Organics.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:02:44):**  How's it going so far?  
**[0:02:45-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:02:45):**  Yeah, yeah, it's growing.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:02:47):**  It's going really great.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:02:48):**  I'm super psyched to be here.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:02:50):**  This is a beautiful part of the world.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:02:52):**  There's so much rich culture.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:02:55):**  I love looking around at all the plants and trying to associate them to designs that I  
**[0:02:59-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:02:59):**  have in my mind for temperate climates.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:03:02):**  And yeah, I'm glad to see.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:03:04):**  Check out your projects, check out Shad's projects, and just be part of what you guys  
**[0:03:07-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:03:07):**  are all doing down here in this part of the world.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:03:09):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:03:10):**  Well, it's a blast to have you here.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:03:13):**  And I know you've just come off of a lot of other travels in the previous months.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:03:17):**  I've been following you on Instagram and your posts on Facebook.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:03:20):**  Can you tell us a little bit about some of the projects and the organizations that you've  
**[0:03:24-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:03:24):**  been visiting around the world?  
**[0:03:26-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:03:26):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:03:28):**  Yeah, it's been really rewarding moving around with the Permaculture Mark Garden book and  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:03:32):**  sharing that knowledge to a diverse array of people.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:03:36):**  It's been taken in for commercial application for market gardening in the Northeast, doing  
**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:03:41):**  a lot of work with Yes Tomorrow Design Build School, an 11-acre farm, developing huaculture  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:03:47):**  food forests there.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:03:49):**  Also, traveling down to South Africa, working with groups down there, the Hope Foundation,  
**[0:03:57-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:03:57):**  and starting to build some permabed food forest down there, actually looking to train teachers  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:04:05):**  on how to build edible ecosystems, edible food guilds, and then they can bring that  
**[0:04:10-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:04:10):**  knowledge back to the schools.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:04:12):**  So that's a really great project that we're going to be touching back with in the coming  
**[0:04:17-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:04:17):**  year.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:04:18):**  And yeah, I've been along the West Coast.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:04:22):**  Really interesting to see what's going on there.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:04:25):**  I just recently did a trip down from Portland to San Francisco, visited some really innovative  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:04:31):**  food farms that are doing dry farm orcharding, some really sustainable market gardens that  
**[0:04:36-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:04:36):**  are really pushing the edge with soil health, and just seeing how we can galvanize energy  
**[0:04:43-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:04:43):**  behind this movement.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:04:45):**  And what I'd really like to see is how there's so many similarities from Africa to Israel  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:04:51):**  to Portugal or the East Coast to the West Coast to the U.S. or down here.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:04:56):**  There's just so much similarity to be had, and that's permaculture.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:05:01):**  We've seen those universal principles, those natural principles that we can integrate to  
**[0:05:05-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:05:05):**  create sustainable design.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:05:07):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:05:08):**  Yeah, I've found similar things in my own travels, not only just with permaculture projects  
**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:05:13):**  that are land-based, but also natural building as well.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:05:17):**  Now you said that there's a lot of commonalities within the organizations and the sites that  
**[0:05:21-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:05:21):**  you visited in your travels.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:05:22):**  Can you tell me about some of the more unique, let's say challenges or issues that are facing  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:05:29):**  different regions and perhaps some unique approaches that you've found during your travels?  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:05:34):**  Yeah, I mean, first of all, you always see the different climates, the different environments  
**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:05:40):**  and ecosystems that people are working within.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:05:43):**  But one of the commonalities is that within all of those, we have ground cover plants  
**[0:05:47-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:05:47):**  and we have overstory trees and understory trees and berry bushes and nitrogen fixers.  
**[0:05:53-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:05:53):**  So the design of integrated food production is applicable in every ecosystem, in every  
**[0:06:00-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:06:00):**  different biome in the world.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:06:02):**  A lot of the other things happening with different organizations or businesses is this struggle  
**[0:06:07-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:06:07):**  to balance the ethics and the ideology behind permaculture with the profitability that we  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:06:14):**  need to actually keep that farm running, keep that ecological business running.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:06:19):**  And so finding those ways to streamline it.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:06:22):**  And one of the things that I'm seeing and it's been really rewarding because I put this  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:06:26):**  out in the book, this idea of balancing your enterprises on a farm and actually having  
**[0:06:31-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:06:31):**  maybe three major enterprises as both a kind of minimum and maximum of your focused, productive  
**[0:06:38-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:06:38):**  diversity.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:06:40):**  And it's been really rewarding to see that the most successful projects I've found are  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:06:45):**  tending to do this, that over the years they're naturally tending to simplify.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:06:51):**  But the diversity of the farm is not going down.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:06:55):**  It's just it's a little more focused.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:06:57):**  It's like focusing on berry production but still having abundant flowers integrated into  
**[0:07:02-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:07:02):**  the guilds.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:07:03):**  You're not managing flowers for cut flowers or for edible flowers, but you have them there.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:07:08):**  But you're focusing on that berry production as one of your key enterprises.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:07:12):**  So I'm tending to see that everywhere I go that the really successful farms on all scales,  
**[0:07:18-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:07:18):**  the successful homesteads are finding a way to a simpler diversity, a more productive,  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:07:25):**  effective agro ecological production.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:07:30):**  Yeah that's one of the ideas that I hear echoed from a lot of, like you said, the more successful  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:07:34):**  and profitable enterprises within permaculture.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:07:38):**  I know people like Joel Salatin really preach niching down and getting your enterprises  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:07:45):**  kind of focused so that you can make them more efficient and effective.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:07:50):**  Mark Shepherd as well talks about finding the perennial plants that naturally do well  
**[0:07:56-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:07:56):**  in your bio region, your ecology, and then just figuring out how to best guild them and  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:08:04):**  integrate them in with other supportive systems that take down the amount of work and maintenance  
**[0:08:09-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:08:09):**  that you do.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:08:10):**  And I know that was another thing that we wanted to talk about too and that's finding  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:08:13):**  a way to balance your lifestyle and make sure that you don't get mired in the systems and  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:08:18):**  the maintenance that you've designed in for yourself in your own context and in your own  
**[0:08:23-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:08:23):**  farm.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:08:24):**  But also within the examples that you've seen in your travels.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:08:26):**  How is this, can you give us some examples of how this has worked out well?  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:08:33):**  Yeah this is a really important thing and it's near and dear to my heart to design your  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:08:39):**  farm so that you're able to farm it and it's not farming you.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:08:44):**  And this starts right at the get go, especially if you're just getting into living more on  
**[0:08:49-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:08:49):**  the land or to start a food based or ecological based business that you focus right away to  
**[0:08:55-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:08:55):**  kind of set out some goals, have a holistic plan in mind of what you want out of your  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:09:01):**  life that's more than just the production, that's more than just that.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:09:05):**  So that you start to question every decision you're going to make and bounce it against  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:09:10):**  that holistic goal.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:09:12):**  And this has been developed by Alan Savory and this holistic management, this holistic  
**[0:09:18-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:09:18):**  goal idea is a great one.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:09:20):**  I recommend people follow through on that more in other readings.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:09:24):**  And I've integrated that into my production and allowed that process of revisiting my  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:09:31):**  original goals, which had, you know, I'd like to travel a little more and be able to see  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:09:36):**  other projects and to gain information through that journey.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:09:41):**  I'd like to be able to have time to nurture my creative side and I manifested that with  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:09:49):**  this book, The Permaculture Market Garden, because I did, I took the systems that I was  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:09:55):**  doing on my farm and the production and put that in and fueled that through creative design  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:10:00):**  to produce a book that was artistic and design and also about, you know, skill-based knowledge  
**[0:10:06-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:10:06):**  sharing.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:10:07):**  Right.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:10:08):**  So these, a lot of these things were actually in my original holistic goal that was put  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:10:13):**  together seven or eight years ago after I'd already been farming for three or four years.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:10:18):**  And it's about creating that tight vision of how you can balance your own personal journey  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:10:25):**  and, you know, your community and your land and not lose too much track of where you want  
**[0:10:31-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:10:31):**  to go in life by just constantly, you know, buying more equipment for your farm or constantly  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:10:38):**  just getting bigger in your production because you can, it's easy to get bigger.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:10:43):**  It's difficult to stay small.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:10:45):**  It's difficult to stay true to your, your original life vision.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:10:49):**  So I think that that's something that should really be visited upon is look into a holistic  
**[0:10:54-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:10:54):**  goal, consider making it.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:10:56):**  We just did that today actually with the students at a titland organics, I think it was a great  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:10:59):**  exercise and everybody was like really keen on exploring how they could take a lot of  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:11:03):**  the designs that they had been learning and a lot of the mapping techniques that have  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:11:08):**  been taught and then kind of go, okay, hold on, how do I bring this back to myself and  
**[0:11:12-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:11:12):**  what do I really want to do?  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:11:13):**  So you design a farm and a life that you want to live because if you don't last, your farm  
**[0:11:18-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:11:18):**  won't last.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:11:20):**  Yeah, and with increasing diversity and different enterprises on projects like this, it's so  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:11:26):**  easy to get mired down in just the amount of tasks that you have.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:11:31):**  Like we're fortunate to be living in an area where hiring labor is very cheap, so it's  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:11:37):**  fairly easy for us in comparison to perhaps in other countries to farm out some of our  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:11:42):**  maintenance and get support that we can justify what the small amount of profits that we're  
**[0:11:48-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:11:48):**  making from the little enterprises that we have on our homestead.  
**[0:11:51-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:11:51):**  But I really liked that you brought up lifestyle design because that goes so key in with basically  
**[0:12:00-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:12:00):**  any type of lifestyle project that you're putting in.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:12:02):**  And don't get me wrong, if you're doing anything with the land or even with a home building  
**[0:12:07-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:12:07):**  or infrastructure building, your lifestyle will be included in it.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:12:10):**  And if you don't design sort of an end game of how you want to live, this is a trap that  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:12:15):**  I personally have fallen into quite a bit, especially as like a new business owner and  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:12:19):**  only just in the last handful of years.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:12:22):**  You very quickly just start taking on as much as possible and it takes over your life.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:12:28):**  Especially most entrepreneurs and early startup business owners fall into this trap so easily  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:12:34):**  because you have trouble perhaps with cashflow in the beginning and you think that just taking  
**[0:12:40-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:12:40):**  on more work is going to solve that.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:12:42):**  And eventually you end up in a state where you're working more hours than if you had  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:12:45):**  just stayed with a job at another company.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:12:48):**  And that defeats the purpose.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:12:50):**  Like the best part about working for yourself is that you can potentially set your own hours.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:12:54):**  But if you don't have that lifestyle design planned out in the future, it just ends up  
**[0:12:59-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:12:59):**  being as much of a trap as anything.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:13:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:13:02):**  No, I hear you with that.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:13:04):**  That's so key.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:13:06):**  One of the things I'm really getting keen on too is helping bring kind of commercial  
**[0:13:10-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:13:10):**  level skills to home gardeners and homesteaders because a lot of times there's some pretty  
**[0:13:18-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:13:18):**  good skills that can really help gain efficiency.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:13:20):**  I mean, do you want to have a garden and buy a bunch of expensive transplants for three,  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:13:26):**  four dollars a pop, say a pepper transplant and put it in the ground and you weed a lot  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:13:31):**  and you get a couple of green peppers.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:13:35):**  But is this your lifestyle?  
**[0:13:36-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:13:36):**  Is that the light?  
**[0:13:37-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:13:37):**  Like you put forth, oh, I want to be surrounded by food.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:13:40):**  I want to garden.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:13:41):**  What do you want?  
**[0:13:42-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:13:42):**  Like, do you want to have 30 percent of your food needs met from your own garden?  
**[0:13:50-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:13:50):**  Or do you want to have 30 percent of your food needs met from your own garden by growing  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:13:54):**  all of your berry needs?  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:13:57):**  Let's get specific on how we're gardening, how we're farming, focusing it.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:14:02):**  Because also, do you want to be able to play music?  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:14:06):**  Do you like to take hikes?  
**[0:14:10-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:14:10):**  And also orienting that farm business and that garden business around like what you  
**[0:14:14-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:14:14):**  really like to do.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:14:15):**  So I'm starting to move more into seed and nursery because I love having my hands on  
**[0:14:22-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:14:22):**  trees.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:14:23):**  That's what I love.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:14:24):**  And I'm like, all right.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:14:25):**  I did a lot of great annual production systems and I've been transitioning towards a woodland  
**[0:14:30-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:14:30):**  agro ecosystem.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:14:32):**  And increasingly it's going where I want it because I always followed that true vision  
**[0:14:37-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:14:37):**  of my personal journey that I want to continue to have my hands on trees.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:14:43):**  And I want to continue to do it in a way that I also get to my time to have my hands on  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:14:48):**  you know other activities like time to do some sketch art and time to take a walk, you  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:14:53):**  know, and time to be with, you know, family and friends.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:14:57):**  So time to be down here, teach a PDC in Guatemala and see what you guys are up to, right?  
**[0:15:02-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:15:02):**  Yeah, it's been fantastic having you here.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:15:05):**  We've got a whole other week.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:15:06):**  I'm going to be teaching the practicals on natural building up on the course later next  
**[0:15:10-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:15:10):**  week.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:15:11):**  So that's going to be fun too.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:15:13):**  Along what we were talking about there is actually still a lot of potential to do more  
**[0:15:20-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:15:20):**  with unused land.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:15:22):**  I know it's kind of a little awkward of a transition here, but it was something that  
**[0:15:25-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:15:25):**  you and I were talking about last night over dinner is that many of the plots that we think  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:15:32):**  of as being kind of useless, everything from medians in between highways strips between  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:15:38):**  sidewalks and roads, all kinds of unused land, like little islands and parking lots have  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:15:43):**  a huge potential, especially if managed correctly.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:15:48):**  Can you talk a little bit about the potential that you see in those places and what you  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:15:52):**  would do with them if you had better access or if you could perhaps convince a municipality  
**[0:15:57-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:15:57):**  or a local government to make use of them?  
**[0:15:59-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:15:59):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:16:02):**  And honestly, like this is forefront in my mind right now.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:16:06):**  I'm constantly looking at underutilized spaces in cities and suburbs and countryside.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:16:14):**  You know, anything from a field that grows a monoculture, which is not maximizing its  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:16:18):**  photosynthetic potential to, like you said, the medians or green spaces we have in urban  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:16:23):**  suburban areas that just simply aren't also maximizing their potential.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:16:28):**  And yet they're also the areas that are right adjacent to people.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:16:31):**  So we need to bring food back to where people live.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:16:34):**  We need to bring true human habitat back to where people live.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:16:38):**  And that's, you know, clean air, fresh water, abundant, diversified and useful plants, good  
**[0:16:44-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:16:44):**  shelter, community.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:16:46):**  You know, is there anything really more human than, you know, walking along a berry hedge  
**[0:16:51-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:16:51):**  together, picking berries, putting some in our mouths, talking, putting some away for  
**[0:16:57-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:16:57):**  later?  
**[0:16:58-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:16:58):**  I think this is what it is to be human.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:16:59):**  You know, it's movement, it's fresh food, it's clean air.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:17:03):**  You know, it's putting aside some for later to bring home to the home.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:17:07):**  So I would see these spaces get utilized to get layered appropriately with site appropriate  
**[0:17:13-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:17:13):**  plants to get, you know, a program going to start to trial what's going to be successful  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:17:20):**  in different areas and to start to move genetic material around.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:17:25):**  And it's coming.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:17:27):**  It's coming.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:17:29):**  I see a ton of potential for those types of things in community building projects as well.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:17:33):**  I mean, think about, especially in the suburbs or even in urban areas, much like around where  
**[0:17:38-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:17:38):**  I've lived and grown up at different stages of my life.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:17:41):**  Many of those times I didn't really know my neighbors at all.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:17:43):**  We didn't interact with them hardly at all.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:17:45):**  There were very few public spaces in those neighborhoods for us to interact even if we  
**[0:17:50-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:17:50):**  wanted to.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:17:51):**  And it's created a big divide in our culture and in our day to day interactions with our  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:17:56):**  communities, which I think inviting spaces and transitioning from, like you said, like  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:18:02):**  maybe just a bunch of grass and a median to a berry patch or something could really facilitate  
**[0:18:07-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:18:07):**  those types of connections and help to unite community.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:18:10):**  That's one of the big potentials that I see in those types of things.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:18:13):**  And also I think there's possibly a lot of easily moved around resources.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:18:19):**  Just think about how many of those spaces that we just talked about are regularly mowed  
**[0:18:24-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:18:24):**  by heavy machinery.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:18:26):**  That's not cheap.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:18:27):**  And if you just diverted that money away from the unnecessary maintenance of a monoculture  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:18:33):**  that brings no joy to anyone, it would start to take care of itself and give dividends  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:18:39):**  back to the community for probably, especially over the long term, much less money than it  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:18:44):**  costs to maintain them as basically a dead green patch.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:18:48):**  Wouldn't you think?  
**[0:18:49-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:18:49):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:18:51):**  And I would say that to add to that, I love looking at the machines and tools that are  
**[0:18:57-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:18:57):**  currently being used in say universities and public spaces and saying, how can we take  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:19:03):**  what's already here, what's already in use and change how it's used?  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:19:08):**  How do we take this leaf blowing system and make it into a mulch application?  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:19:12):**  How do we take these spaces that people move along all the time, like the long lanes where  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:19:18):**  students walk to and from classes?  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:19:20):**  It's so frequented, it's just crying to go into a diversified guild.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:19:25):**  It's crying for black raspberries, red raspberries, pears, time and things like this.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:19:30):**  It's just crying for it.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:19:32):**  And it's really easy actually to maintain the human environment that we've created because  
**[0:19:38-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:19:38):**  we created it to be fairly easy to maintain, except for we have monoculture, which is actually  
**[0:19:44-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:19:44):**  very costly to maintain in the long run.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:19:47):**  So if we divert that money into something that's eventually going to start to regenerate  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:19:51):**  itself to maintain itself more or less, and people are going to enjoy using and interacting  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:19:57):**  with, I think it'll really transform the way that we commune and the way that we are able  
**[0:20:02-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:20:02):**  to access good food.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:20:05):**  It's going to change our food sovereignty and start to really bring that closer to home.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:20:13):**  I mean, I'll even go out on a limb here and for the amount of potential that I see in  
**[0:20:16-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:20:16):**  something like that, if anybody listening here is like part of a civic planning committee  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:20:21):**  or knows somebody in local government who potentially would latch onto an idea like  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:20:26):**  this, please contact me directly at abundant edge.com on the contacts page.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:20:31):**  I would be more than happy to give free consultation or planning session to anybody who thinks  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:20:36):**  that they could even get a small project like this started.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:20:40):**  I would be more than happy to give my time and efforts to help that along.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:20:44):**  So let's switch gears a little bit here and go back to something that I know you're very  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:20:48):**  passionate about as I've seen your presence on social media and that's bringing culture  
**[0:20:53-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:20:53):**  back into the permaculture that you do as work.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:20:56):**  I know you like to integrate music and other forms of art into expressions like this.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:21:03):**  Tell me a little bit about why you're passionate about communicating these principles and these  
**[0:21:08-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:21:08):**  ideals in new ways.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:21:10):**  Yeah, I mean, a part of it is about just having that diversity of your own life and what you  
**[0:21:16-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:21:16):**  like to do.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:21:17):**  So, you know, beginning to integrate, you know, illustration back into my work, which  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:21:21):**  is something I did when I was younger and exploring music, spoken word again.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:21:27):**  It's just part of expression for me.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:21:29):**  But also I think that, you know, this is key is that agriculture, you know, it's about  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:21:36):**  bringing back our daily cultural activities to be relevant to the most important things  
**[0:21:42-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:21:42):**  around us, which is, you know, people and food and land stewardship and quality housing.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:21:50):**  And you know, that's cool and that's beautiful.  
**[0:21:54-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:21:54):**  And you know, we can start to create conscious lyrics and music and we can create, you know,  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:22:00):**  beautiful murals and things that are out there right now, but continue to cultivate that  
**[0:22:05-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:22:05):**  through permaculture and natural building and things like that, that idea of reintegrating  
**[0:22:12-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:22:12):**  music and hip hop and art and everything into permaculture and gardening and homesteading  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:22:18):**  and all these wonderful regenerative professions and activities.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:22:23):**  Yeah, I mean, this opens up the gates for people who are not particularly interested  
**[0:22:30-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:22:30):**  in interacting with gardens or farming to have meaningful contributions to the general  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:22:36):**  movement of regenerating and reviving the health and the potential of this planet.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:22:41):**  You know, if your passion is music or if your passion is art or if your passion is engineering  
**[0:22:46-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:22:46):**  or something even seemingly unrelated, there's so much opportunity to express yourself and  
**[0:22:52-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:22:52):**  help to advance positive initiatives and projects like this through the lens in which you see  
**[0:22:58-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:22:58):**  the world in offering your talents and your expertise to have a positive impact.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:23:05):**  Tell me a little bit about the hip hop that you do along the lines of permaculture, because  
**[0:23:11-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:23:11):**  I've been following that Instagram feed for a while and I love what you're putting out.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:23:16):**  All right.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:23:17):**  Well I think instead of tell you, I think I'll just spit something.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:23:20):**  All right.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:23:21):**  But you got to kick me a bit of a beat.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:23:23):**  All right.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:23:24):**  Let's do it.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:23:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:23:27):**  Take a seed from the top of any tree.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:23:33):**  It's what you need.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:23:34):**  Put it down deep in the ground.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:23:36):**  So slow where the water flows, that ecological system is going to grow, grow, grow.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:23:42):**  You know a seed opens up, letting out a little root, a little cotyledon.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:23:46):**  It's going to go up, up, supping on the sunlight.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:23:49):**  Going to grow with mighty might.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:23:50):**  Going to grow a food force, an ecological agro-ecosystem so that we can have good food  
**[0:23:54-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:23:54):**  for women and men and children.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:23:56):**  We only borrow the earth from our children.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:23:59):**  So we got to give a little seed, my friend.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:24:03):**  Nice one.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:24:04):**  I knew you had a good flow and you're just waiting to come out.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:24:08):**  So there you go.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:24:09):**  There's an excellent example of how you can express yourself in new ways that seemingly  
**[0:24:13-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:24:13):**  are unrelated, but have a fantastic opportunity to project your personal contributions and  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:24:19):**  talents into something that's really beneficial for everyone.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:24:22):**  So thank you for sharing that.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:24:24):**  And if anybody is interested, how can they find out more about what you're doing?  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:24:30):**  Well you can definitely check out my Instagram and Facebook feed at Zach Lokes and you can  
**[0:24:35-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:24:35):**  put that out I guess for everybody.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:24:37):**  For the hip hop I do have a channel at MC Ecology where I mostly try to spit things  
**[0:24:42-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:24:42):**  that have a kind of ecological or food based soundtrack to it.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:24:49):**  So yeah, check it out.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:24:52):**  All right, well before we go here and I will put up all those links in the show notes on  
**[0:24:56-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:24:56):**  the website.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:24:57):**  Tell us a little bit about your experience down here in Guatemala.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:25:00):**  You visited our budding homestead and all of our projects that we've been doing, including  
**[0:25:04-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:25:04):**  the waterway crocodile and shark, which we'll post pictures of later.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:25:11):**  That was a great contribution from one of our local students named Ricardo.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:25:17):**  And you've also spent a lot of time now up at Shad's farm at Atitlan Organics.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:25:21):**  Tell us a little bit about your impressions, some of your ideas of the differences between  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:25:25):**  the ecology and the biodiversity here than where you're used to farming.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:25:29):**  Yeah, I'd just love to hear your impression.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:25:33):**  Yeah, first of all, I've got mad respect for you guys that are just digging out homesteads  
**[0:25:39-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:25:39):**  and gardens from the sides of this land.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:25:42):**  For those of you listening, this part of Guatemala along Lake Atitlan, this is the highlands  
**[0:25:47-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:25:47):**  of Guatemala.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:25:48):**  There are some steep mountains here.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:25:50):**  There's volcanoes.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:25:51):**  There are bones in the earth here.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:25:54):**  There are rock.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:25:55):**  There is a lot of rock.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:25:57):**  And so it's a really big design challenge and an opportunity.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:26:01):**  So that rock presents great opportunities for paving or creating rock walls for heat  
**[0:26:06-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:26:06):**  sinks.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:26:08):**  And it's been really rewarding to take some of the guild designs and huaculture designs  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:26:13):**  that I've been integrating on my farm and other places and using them in with this rocky  
**[0:26:19-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:26:19):**  land.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:26:20):**  Creating, you know, a mix of hay bale with stone wall with huaculture compost system  
**[0:26:27-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:26:27):**  to create these edible ecosystems.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:26:30):**  We did two installs yesterday and today.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:26:34):**  And yeah, it was really great to see that and really great to see just all the ways  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:26:38):**  that everybody here is, you know, beginning to cultivate community.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:26:43):**  There's a great community that is building here around food forest design, around education,  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:26:50):**  around sustainable building and around, you know, the cultivation of community in itself.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:26:56):**  I really feel that.  
**[0:26:57-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:26:57):**  And so I'm really glad to be a part of it.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:26:59):**  Well, it's been such a pleasure to have you here.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:27:02):**  We've still got more than a week left to go.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:27:04):**  So we're going to make the most out of the time that we've got you.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:27:09):**  And I would love to hear more about your ideas for how we can be developing the homestead.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:27:13):**  You had some awesome kind of observations and initial ideas for the sections of our  
**[0:27:19-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:27:19):**  land that we haven't even started to touch yet, just because we got to finish up the  
**[0:27:22-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:27:22):**  projects that we started before we start getting off into everything.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:27:26):**  And like you said, because of all the rocks that we have, it's slow moving.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:27:30):**  But when you do make adjustments in the land, they're fairly permanent and they're very  
**[0:27:35-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:27:35):**  long lasting because of the durability of the materials that we have to work with.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:27:39):**  And you know, it definitely is a challenge working with these types of structures and  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:27:44):**  factors on the landscape, but definitely coming from a natural building perspective, I basically  
**[0:27:49-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:27:49):**  have all my little playground tools right there in our land and we got to move them  
**[0:27:53-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:27:53):**  so that we can plant plants anyway.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:27:55):**  So we turn them into like dry stack walls for on contour for terracing.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:28:01):**  We've used them in our foundations for the house.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:28:03):**  And in that way, we've been able to avoid using a single drop of cement in the entire  
**[0:28:07-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:28:07):**  structure.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:28:08):**  So, you know, as is always repeated as like the favorite phrase in permaculture, the problem  
**[0:28:13-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:28:13):**  is a solution.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:28:14):**  If you are having an issue with a surplus of something, you really just haven't been  
**[0:28:18-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:28:18):**  creative enough on how to use it.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:28:20):**  And so, you know, constantly coming up with new ideas of how to use these resources that  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:28:25):**  would otherwise be, you know, challenges or deterrents.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:28:29):**  And you know, the creativity challenges like that, it's always fun.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:28:33):**  Never get bored with that around here.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:28:36):**  All right, so we're going to check in with you again on another episode soon and you,  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:28:42):**  me and Shad will have the opportunity to sit down and go over a lot of the concepts that  
**[0:28:47-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:28:47):**  we want to dive deeper into.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:28:48):**  So until next time, thank you so much for making the time today.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:28:51):**  It's been a real pleasure having you here.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:28:54):**  Always a pleasure and look forward to the next time.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:28:58):**  Maybe I'll even have chairs next time.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:29:00):**  We're just sitting on the floor on my terrace right now.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:29:02):**  Don't get me wrong, a great view of the lake, but I'm just renting this place temporarily  
**[0:29:08-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:29:08):**  while we get our house built.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:29:10):**  So the next time you come and visit us, we'll have much nicer infrastructure to accommodate  
**[0:29:14-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:29:14):**  you with.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:29:15):**  Very naturally integrated here.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:29:16):**  We're very much, you know, part of the landscape.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:29:19):**  Yeah, man, you got to live your own process.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:29:22):**  All right, cool.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks-2/#t=0:29:23):**  We'll check in again soon and I'll talk to you later.

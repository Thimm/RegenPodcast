**[0:04:58-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:04:58):**  for those listeners that aren't aware what PDC stands for. I'd had so, so much fun, it

**[0:05:27-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:05:27):**  like just this opposite experience where we were all invited into our creativity, invited  
**[0:05:35-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:05:35):**  to collaborate, to think outside the box, to, you know, to explore solutions and to

**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:05:51):**  fun that when it came to the what would be your long term goals and visions, I was just  
**[0:05:56-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:05:56):**  like, well wouldn't it be fun if I could teach permaculture? Not with it, you know, like  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:06:03):**  sometimes now I do visioning in more of a kind of like I really want to make this happen,  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:06:08):**  I'm going to do design and make this happen but that was just like put out there in this,  
**[0:06:13-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:06:13):**  you know, just like, just, you know, wild abandon or just kind of like, yeah that would  
**[0:06:19-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:06:19):**  be so much fun and then little did I know the power of voicing our visions at that time  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:06:28):**  because then from saying that then there's an opportunity to meet with other permaculture  
**[0:06:34-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:06:34):**  teachers and I went on and took that opportunity and then people were saying, well it's a great  
**[0:06:41-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:06:41):**  idea to do like an adult learning education course, you know, you can do them at any local  
**[0:06:49-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:06:49):**  colleges and then, you know, lo and behold the local college did offer one and then I  
**[0:06:57-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:06:57):**  went on that and then they're like, well, you know, there's, you need to actually go  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:07:01):**  and get your teaching experience and so from then this idea then became very real to me  
**[0:07:07-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:07:07):**  and I had to find other permaculture teachers to apprentice with and actually, you know,  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:07:15):**  plan, organise courses myself. So that was all really inspiring and I had a, you know,  
**[0:07:21-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:07:21):**  a young child, my daughter was young at that time, this was like 20 years ago and so obviously  
**[0:07:28-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:07:28):**  my time was quite limited so I was having to do this adult education course and teach

**[0:07:43-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:07:43):**  interwove and, you know, integrate rather than segregate principle rather than, you

**[0:08:04-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:08:04):**  came about designing permaculture courses and translating the principles of permaculture  
**[0:08:11-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:08:11):**  into teaching. So the principle, for example, of everyone, everything gardens that you think  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:08:18):**  about in the landscape, everything gardens, you then in the teaching environment can become  
**[0:08:24-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:08:24):**  everyone teaches. And so then it's like how do you support that multidimensional, multidirectional  
**[0:08:36-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:08:36):**  flows of learning in the classroom, for example. And so that was what, you know, became several  
**[0:08:47-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:08:47):**  of my designs for my diploma to really weave that in and to weave in my own pathway to  
**[0:08:54-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:08:54):**  becoming a permaculture teacher. And that really showed me the flexibility of the permaculture  
**[0:09:01-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:09:01):**  principles, that they can be translated to any environment, to any situation, and that  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:09:11):**  they have power and strength in doing that.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:09:16):**  And so given this malleability of these principles, how can they be applied to social interactions  
**[0:09:22-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:09:22):**  and community dynamics, and what made you choose to focus on that aspect of application?  
**[0:09:29-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:09:29):**  Well so then I started teaching permaculture and I realized that the permaculture principles  
**[0:09:39-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:09:39):**  have so much more potential and that permaculture in people's lives, when they really grasp  
**[0:09:47-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:09:47):**  it, it moves from like an interesting way of gardening to a lifestyle, to a livelihood,  
**[0:09:56-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:09:56):**  to a community of friends and like-minded people. And that shift is actually really  
**[0:10:06-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:10:06):**  common, but not often talked about. And it's not often written about as well. And it's  
**[0:10:17-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:10:17):**  very tangible and visible to see the applications in the garden, but it's less obvious to start  
**[0:10:25-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:10:25):**  talking about how, you know, my relationship is improved by using permaculture design.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:10:33):**  You know, it would be a bit strange to invite people to observe your permaculture relationship.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:10:41):**  It just doesn't quite work in the same way as come and see my permaculture garden. And  
**[0:10:47-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:10:47):**  so that was kind of one of the motivations, was really seeing the potential for the permaculture  
**[0:10:57-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:10:57):**  principles and design to really improve our lives in so many different facets and to not

**[0:11:40-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:11:40):**  ways of thinking that holders in consumerist culture that, you know, holders in short-term

**[0:11:59-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:11:59):**  and et cetera, et cetera at the moment. So to really see them as useful and see the,

**[0:12:16-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:12:16):**  for, you know, global transformation, which is really what we're trying to do, isn't it?  
**[0:12:26-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:12:26):**  It's like we're not, as permaculturists, we're not just trying to change how our food comes

**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:12:55):**  ability to recognize patterns in the natural world and integrate them in with landscape  
**[0:13:00-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:13:00):**  design and even building design as I've often applied it. And I'm wondering how you found  
**[0:13:06-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:13:06):**  that we can learn from these patterns in nature to inform the healthy configuration of community  
**[0:13:12-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:13:12):**  structures and also for personal development.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:13:15):**  Well, let's start with personal development and that pattern recognition, because so when  
**[0:13:24-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:13:24):**  we start to see that we have this web of patterns and I refer to culture, my working definition  
**[0:13:33-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:13:33):**  of culture is a complex web of seen and unseen patterns of thinking and behaving and interacting  
**[0:13:42-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:13:42):**  and feeling. And these, this complex web of patterns that we all have our own individual  
**[0:13:50-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:13:50):**  complex web as well as being part of other, other webs. And when we start to observe our  
**[0:13:59-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:13:59):**  own patterns, we can then also start to pattern disrupt. It's one of the practices of cultural  
**[0:14:06-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:14:06):**  emergence is pattern disruption to invite change. And the path. So starting with that  
**[0:14:14-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:14:14):**  observation of patterns, we can start to see how maybe our sleep patterns interact with  
**[0:14:19-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:14:19):**  our eating patterns, interact with our work patterns, um, our energy levels and our family  
**[0:14:27-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:14:27):**  dynamics, how they start to all interweave. And when we start to shift one of them that  
**[0:14:34-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:14:34):**  that can ripple out and have all sorts of positive or negative effects within that whole  
**[0:14:41-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:14:41):**  web of patterns. So within our whole, you know, our whole lifestyle. So that pattern  
**[0:14:47-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:14:47):**  recognition and that pattern literacy that you're talking about can really support us  
**[0:14:53-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:14:53):**  in shift in first recognizing them in order to then make positive interactions that can  
**[0:15:01-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:15:01):**  ripple out and cause the whole, um, a whole shift in our, in our, in our personal culture,  
**[0:15:13-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:15:13):**  our whole wellbeing. Uh, and that's also true then on a community level or group level or  
**[0:15:20-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:15:20):**  family level where you can start to see the patterns of interaction there. Um, and some  
**[0:15:27-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:15:27):**  of the patterns from, so that's kind of more of the behavioral thinking patterns. There's  
**[0:15:34-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:15:34):**  also like the structural patterns of nature, like the spiral or branching patterns, which  
**[0:15:40-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:15:40):**  we can also use to, um, to think of the configuration of our work places. Uh, you know, where, where  
**[0:15:48-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:15:48):**  are the flows of communication? Is it like a bird's nest and it's all like that, that  
**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:15:55):**  net pattern and communications all, it's all happening all over the place. Or is it more  
**[0:16:00-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:16:00):**  like a branching pattern where it's flows, flows from one place and forks and then moves,  
**[0:16:07-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:16:07):**  um, moves forward in that way. So we can start to play with those, those patterns of nature,  
**[0:16:16-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:16:16):**  those structural patterns of nature as well in our community designs.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:16:22):**  I love this idea of pattern disruption as a way of sort of auditing our own processes  
**[0:16:27-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:16:27):**  and figuring out where perhaps personal issues, uh, for ourselves, or maybe even in our communities  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:16:35):**  might stem from, can you perhaps give me an example of something that's come up in a course  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:16:40):**  or maybe even in your own life that you can use as an illustration for how this sort of  
**[0:16:45-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:16:45):**  works out? Yes. So pattern disruption is an invitation  
**[0:16:48-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:16:48):**  to move away from automatic pilot. So to let go of some of the cultural conditioning that  
**[0:16:57-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:16:57):**  we've, we've got embedded within our minds and within our bodies as well. Um, I'm not,  
**[0:17:05-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:17:05):**  I there's, and there's quite some sort of easy ways in which we can start pattern disruption,  
**[0:17:12-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:17:12):**  like so we can think about how we eat, for example, how quickly we eat. And that's kind  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:17:20):**  of a pattern, you know, and then we can actually sort of think, okay, could I really consciously  
**[0:17:25-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:17:25):**  try and slow this down to a bit more of a steady pace so I'm not just shoveling food  
**[0:17:32-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:17:32):**  in and that, that takes, it takes a bit of effort to do that is, you know, is, it's a  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:17:39):**  basic thing, isn't it about eating and we do it, um, often, you know, most of the time  
**[0:17:45-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:17:45):**  without really being fully present. So, so that's just a small example of how we can,  
**[0:17:53-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:17:53):**  um, you know, start to shift one of the, some of the patterns. Um, I mean, one of the things  
**[0:18:03-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:18:03):**  that happened, uh, for me when I was writing actually people in permaculture, I was very  
**[0:18:10-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:18:10):**  much using my right arm more, um, than my left arm. And I ended up with quite chronic,  
**[0:18:19-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:18:19):**  uh, repetitive strain injury. And from that I realized as one that it wasn't just an issue,  
**[0:18:29-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:18:29):**  a personal issue of my own. It was a cultural issue as well that we live in a world that  
**[0:18:35-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:18:35):**  is very right hand biased. And so we were constantly being invited to use our right

**[0:29:02-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:29:02):**  different framing from permanent culture, which I know isn't, um, it doesn't necessarily  
**[0:29:12-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:29:12):**  mean permanent as in fixed or static. It means something that's able to sustain itself, but  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:29:20):**  I just think that the framing is more useful around cultural emergence.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:29:25):**  Okay. Okay. And so there may not be sort of an ultimate objective that you're working  
**[0:29:31-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:29:31):**  towards, but the things that you mentioned, certainly show a preference for what kind  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:29:37):**  of environment, what kind of interactions, connectivity, empowerment, like you mentioned,  
**[0:29:42-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:29:42):**  you're trying to achieve. And so what are the exercises and the toolkit, like you mentioned,  
**[0:29:49-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:29:49):**  working to add value to an experience or offer new options, uh, with which to work towards?  
**[0:29:57-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:29:57):**  Um, I guess I'm struggling cause I'm trying to, it sounds like it's still coming to an  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:30:02):**  outcome, but you were clear that there's not a singular one.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:30:06):**  Yeah. So there's like regenerative cultures, plural. So it's not trying to put this blanket  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:30:13):**  of this blueprint across the entire planet and all of humanity. It's about saying that  
**[0:30:19-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:30:19):**  there's multiple cultures that can live in harmony and coexist with each other. I mean,  
**[0:30:29-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:30:29):**  I say there's no ultimate goal, but the regenerative cultures. So this is a, you know, if we have  
**[0:30:35-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:30:35):**  cultures that support personal leadership, collective wisdom and earth care. So if we  
**[0:30:44-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:30:44):**  have cultures that support those things, then we will have cultures that are healthy, productive  
**[0:30:52-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:30:52):**  in alignment with the planet. Um, you know, and, and we know that we currently have cultures  
**[0:31:00-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:31:00):**  that Lee, you know, we have war cultures, rape culture, chemical cultures, you know,  
**[0:31:05-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:31:05):**  all of different cultures that kind of coming from this paradigm of separation from nature  
**[0:31:12-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:31:12):**  of competition, of, um, domination over nature. Uh, and that they are leading us in a direction  
**[0:31:25-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:31:25):**  that, you know, apocalyptic direction really. It's, it's quite, uh, you know, the, the chaos  
**[0:31:33-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:31:33):**  is getting closer to the surface and bubbling over in many places. Um, so how, how do we  
**[0:31:44-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:31:44):**  move towards a place that values everyone in society that is building ecosystem restoration  
**[0:31:56-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:31:56):**  that is building communities that is rebalancing social interactions across for everyone. Uh,  
**[0:32:04-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:32:04):**  you know, there's, I mean, actually if you went to kind of, you know, most primary school  
**[0:32:10-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:32:10):**  kids, you could kind of come up with a vision of the, of the planet and regenerative cultures.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:32:17):**  It's not rocket science, but it is quite complex how we move from here to there on a global  
**[0:32:26-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:32:26):**  scale.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:32:27):**  Well, so given that complexity, do you have a process or a framework to work through the,  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:32:34):**  well, the inherent complexity of, of that kind of a goal?  
**[0:32:38-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:32:38):**  Yeah, so there's three phases of cultural emergence, which we start with so that the,  
**[0:32:46-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:32:46):**  the three phrases phases are challenge and awaken, move and invigorate, nourish and empower.  
**[0:32:55-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:32:55):**  And the idea is to bring those phases into balance. So if we start with ourselves personally,  
**[0:33:02-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:33:02):**  but then this is also, uh, you know, scales out as well. So the challenge and awaken phase,  
**[0:33:11-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:33:11):**  uh, like pattern disruption is then one of the practices that supports this challenge  
**[0:33:17-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:33:17):**  and awaken phase. It moves us out of this automatic pilot and invites us into a space  
**[0:33:24-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:33:24):**  of questioning and open to possibilities. And so when we challenge our mindsets, when  
**[0:33:30-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:33:30):**  we become aware of, Oh, what you mean we have a per, I have a personal culture. Oh, okay.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:33:36):**  That's you know, that's quite revelationary for, for most people. You know, it's only  
**[0:33:41-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:33:41):**  been recently since I've been working on this toolkit that I, I've had that phrase of what's  
**[0:33:47-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:33:47):**  my personal culture. So becoming aware of culture of systems of the paradigms we're  
**[0:33:53-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:33:53):**  operating from of pattern disruption, they all help us to move into the space of challenge  
**[0:33:59-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:33:59):**  and awaken, but we don't want to get too, you know, if you, if we activate challenge  
**[0:34:07-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:34:07):**  and awaken too much, it can be overwhelming. It's like, you know, being bombarded with  
**[0:34:12-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:34:12):**  the statistics of climate change, uh, just end up with us kind of wanting to hide under  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:34:19):**  the duvet or, you know, in front of the TV vegging out cause it's like, it's just too  
**[0:34:24-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:34:24):**  much, isn't it? It's like, ah. Um, so we don't want to do too much of the challenge in a  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:34:30):**  way can we need to balance it then with the move and invigorate, which is about moving  
**[0:34:35-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:34:35):**  forwards, getting things done, designing, visioning, um, being effective, you know,  
**[0:34:43-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:34:43):**  being leaderful, you know, being, being an activist, be, you know, doing stuff. Um, and,  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:34:53):**  and that's great, but then that also needs balancing out because if we do too much of  
**[0:34:58-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:34:58):**  that, we end up in burnout. And so we also need to be balanced with the nourish and empower  
**[0:35:04-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:35:04):**  phase, which is about connection and surfacing our gifts and creative expression and peacemaking  
**[0:35:12-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:35:12):**  and, uh, so connection with nature and connection with ourselves and each other. And so that  
**[0:35:19-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:35:19):**  phase, um, is also important, but also we don't want to get, you know, too much of that  
**[0:35:26-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:35:26):**  phase. I mean, we tend into, in, you know, Western cultures to rarely get into the space  
**[0:35:34-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:35:34):**  of too much of that phase, but it is possible and it can become too comfortable in that  
**[0:35:41-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:35:41):**  phase. And we're sort of, we're, we're a bit, we end up losing a bit of empathy for others  
**[0:35:48-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:35:48):**  who are maybe in more in the challenge and awaken phase. And we're a bit too like, well,  
**[0:35:52-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:35:52):**  I'm okay, well, you know, what's the problem? Um, so you know, so that, that again needs  
**[0:36:00-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:36:00):**  balancing. So those phases all need balancing in our lives and that is a dynamic balance.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:36:06):**  So it's not to say, okay, well if I do Monday of challenge and awaken and Tuesday of move  
**[0:36:11-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:36:11):**  and invigorate them Wednesday, you know, it doesn't quite work like that. It's a different,  
**[0:36:17-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:36:17):**  you know, that balance can shift for us at any time. Okay. Like, uh, I think I've done  
**[0:36:23-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:36:23):**  a bit too much this week. Let's move into some more nourish and empower or, uh, you  
**[0:36:28-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:36:28):**  know, different seasons of the year, invite different, um, different phases. And so each  
**[0:36:35-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:36:35):**  of those phase has practices of which I refer to many of them, um, in talking about them.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:36:42):**  And those practices are routines or habits that we bring into our lives. So it's not  
**[0:36:49-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:36:49):**  that pattern disruption we do on a Tuesday afternoon and that's it. It's like we're constantly  
**[0:36:56-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:36:56):**  inviting ourselves, constantly being aware of, okay, actually I think I'm just operating  
**[0:37:01-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:37:01):**  out of automatic pilot here even in the way I greeted you or, um, you know, the way, the  
**[0:37:09-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:37:09):**  way I'm doing things. Is there a different way in which I can do things here? So just  
**[0:37:14-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:37:14):**  being aware of that, aware of when our own personal culture is, um, is guiding us in  
**[0:37:24-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:37:24):**  a way that maybe we're not being very responsible for. So maybe even just, you know, how we're  
**[0:37:32-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:37:32):**  out in the world shopping and being aware of that we're operating out of, you know,  
**[0:37:39-0:37:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:37:39):**  automatic pilot and not making very conscious choices, but then being aware that we are  
**[0:37:45-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:37:45):**  within this bigger cultural context that is, is very much manipulating us to make these  
**[0:37:50-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:37:50):**  choices. Um, you know, by this thing and then, and then you'll be happy kind of thing or,  
**[0:37:58-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:37:58):**  or, and making unhealthy associations. So like buying, buy this thing and then you will  
**[0:38:03-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:38:03):**  be nourished and empowered, but actually you're not, it doesn't equate. It's like that new  
**[0:38:09-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:38:09):**  car doesn't, you know, therefore mean that you end up with a healthy relationship. It's,  
**[0:38:15-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/looby-macnamara-on-the-use-of-permaculture-principles-for-social-and-cultural-emergence/#t=0:38:15):**  um, even though the adverts say that it will. Sure. And so how does one start with coming

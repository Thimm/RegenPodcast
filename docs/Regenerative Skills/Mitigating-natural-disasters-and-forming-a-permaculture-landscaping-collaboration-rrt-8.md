**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:04:18):**  water sound and I could easily see out of my window that there's just, yeah, I mean,

**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:05:13):**  Um, or right in the middle of, of kind of like a small ish, but significant gully.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:05:19):**  Uh, like I say, it was, we didn't really have any choice.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:05:23):**  It was kind of like a natural place to put the house in terms of the shape of the land  
**[0:05:27-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:05:27):**  and maximizing the space.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:05:29):**  Um, and luckily where we are, there's a lot of vegetation above us.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:05:35):**  This kind of like for people new to permaculture design who are doing contour maps and looking  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:05:40):**  to apply kind of the scale of permanence and looking to manage water, very important to  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:05:45):**  realize that the contour map should start not necessarily on the land, but, but above  
**[0:05:50-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:05:50):**  it.  
**[0:05:51-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:05:51):**  Um, so word out water to get sort of, um, uh, in our case, redirected, redirected, uh,  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:06:02):**  just a little bit.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:06:03):**  The next place to sort of like an erosion gully over to the west of our line, maybe  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:06:07):**  10 meters where all the water is running right now, we're allowed to get redirected.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:06:11):**  The next spot it would run down is into the gully that that's above our house.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:06:16):**  So coming up with an on the spot strategy for moving that we already have a big dry  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:06:22):**  wall and, and, um, uh, French drain.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:06:27):**  Um, but we need to, we need to make it bigger and we need to make sure that that gets kicked  
**[0:06:31-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:06:31):**  off to the side ASAP.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:06:34):**  Um, we have maybe about four meters behind the house and there's a big portion cut out  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:06:39):**  before you get to the dry stack wall, which is actually where we're installing private  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:06:44):**  bathrooms for each of the residences.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:06:47):**  Um, and then from there, there's maybe another four meters to the back of the property.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:06:51):**  Now what we've been doing is stacking more stones, which we have in over abundance on  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:06:56):**  our land in a way that kind of slowly redirects the water.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:07:01):**  Cause if you just put a wall or a barrier in front of it, it, first of all, you don't  
**[0:07:06-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:07:06):**  know exactly how it's going to hit it.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:07:08):**  Um, if it brings down solid matter, it could bust right through the barrier because of  
**[0:07:13-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:07:13):**  the force of that much water.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:07:15):**  Or it could go either direction in our case, neither of which is good, would still put  
**[0:07:19-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:07:19):**  it towards the house.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:07:20):**  So we're making a very kind of gradual swoop down this natural belly in order to direct  
**[0:07:27-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:07:27):**  it towards a part of the property where it would do the least amount of damage.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:07:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:07:31):**  And we've kind of got, but just below the house, we've got kind of like a natural sweet  
**[0:07:36-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:07:36):**  spot, which we identified from a long time ago as being kind of a potential overgrown  
**[0:07:43-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:07:43):**  overland storage, which can absorb roof water, gray water, and hopefully flood water.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:07:51):**  But so we're really preoccupied right at our preoccupied.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:07:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:07:56):**  Preoccupied at the moment with making sure that if that water starts to flow over land  
**[0:08:00-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:08:00):**  towards, towards our house, that it gets immediately kicked around the house and then into this  
**[0:08:06-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:08:06):**  pond that is, is the whole house.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:08:08):**  So, um, interesting kind of a design challenge.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:08:13):**  And in general, um, I feel like when you start getting into permaculture, everybody always  
**[0:08:18-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:08:18):**  talks about, don't let water leave your land slow.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:08:21):**  It's spread it, sink it.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:08:24):**  And that is very important because we have six months of drought here.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:08:27):**  So you really do want to, you do really do want to try and save water and create abundance  
**[0:08:32-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:08:32):**  in your land, but you want to do it in a way where huge, you know, here you can get, you  
**[0:08:39-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:08:39):**  know, how much rain can you get in one?  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:08:41):**  What's what's it?  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:08:42):**  What's one severe weather event here, Charlie, do you think we got four inches the night  
**[0:08:47-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:08:47):**  of hurricane Stan.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:08:50):**  So that's a good amount to have in mind when you're planning these things plan for a really,  
**[0:08:55-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:08:55):**  really severe weather event.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:08:58):**  And this is information that you can find on very simple resources like weather.com  
**[0:09:03-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:09:03):**  or NOAA, the N O A A I believe it is from the United States takes a ton of climate data  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:09:10):**  from all over the world.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:09:12):**  All of these are things that you can look up online for free.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:09:15):**  And it's a little bit counterintuitive at times because sometimes you look at the land  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:09:18):**  here, especially during dry season and you do see these kinds of erosion gullies.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:09:22):**  I have these conversations with giants quite a lot, and I said, look, the amount of water  
**[0:09:26-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:09:26):**  that's going to come down here during rainy season is enormous.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:09:30):**  And they kind of don't believe me because they just see dusty land and yeah, it's a  
**[0:09:34-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:09:34):**  bit of a gully fair enough, but actually imagining what four inches of rain that all collects  
**[0:09:42-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:09:42):**  and makes its way into a gully from way further upstream looks like it's actually kind of  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:09:49):**  mind boggling the amount of water and the potential destructiveness that that carries.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:09:54):**  But kind of like finding that balance between saving and using that water, but in a way  
**[0:10:01-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:10:01):**  where it's not going to take structures with it or cause major erosion.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:10:08):**  It's a very interesting challenge to be have here.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:10:10):**  Yeah, we had to look at that as well for measuring gutter sizes, well designing gutter sizes  
**[0:10:16-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:10:16):**  for the hotel, the bamboo guest house, which is something you're connected with.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:10:23):**  And it was, the data was mostly for the US, so I had to choose a US state and it was Hawaii,  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:10:29):**  it was the only state that had hurricanes that you could take the rainfall measurements  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:10:34):**  for and we had to, the biggest gutters you could possibly get was massive 10 inch wide  
**[0:10:39-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:10:39):**  gutters for the hotel.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:10:42):**  And that's what I remember about studying the data for Guatemala, it was as high as  
**[0:10:47-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:10:47):**  it gets because we get hurricanes.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:10:49):**  So we have these absurdly high rain patterns that come through in the form of hurricanes  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:10:57):**  and we don't get affected by the weather, the wind so much, we get affected by the huge  
**[0:11:03-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:11:03):**  amount of rain that gets dumped on us.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:11:05):**  And many of the people who built in San Marcos, La Laguna, which is the neighboring town from  
**[0:11:10-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:11:10):**  you guys, we, all the foreigners came here in the 80s and 90s and noughties and bought  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:11:17):**  land in this beautiful valley and then found out that none of the locals built here because  
**[0:11:23-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:11:23):**  that's where the hurricane would, every 50 years would clean out the valley with several  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:11:31):**  meters of dirt and it would come down very destructively.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:11:35):**  And we found this out in 2005 with Hurricane Stan and then Tropical Storm 12e and not,

**[0:19:22-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:19:22):**  catchment area.

**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:19:31):**  right in a large valley among other mountains, which is exactly the same internet.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:19:36):**  Yeah, so these little valleys around this gigantic, great.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:19:41):**  So again, steep mountains, and very prone to erosion and landslides.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:19:48):**  And we estimated that there were 450 small landslides all around the slopes, and they

**[0:20:06-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:20:06):**  And something I learned through building on these slopes is that it all depends on what  
**[0:20:12-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:20:12):**  it's made of and how steep it is.

**[0:20:18-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:20:18):**  it becomes.

**[0:20:26-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:20:26):**  and earthquakes.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:20:27):**  Or the worst case scenario that he painted was a hurricane and an earthquake at the same  
**[0:20:32-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:20:32):**  time where you would get possibly a blockage up higher in the valley, and it fills up and  
**[0:20:40-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:20:40):**  fills up until you build like a dam of water and debris behind it.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:20:46):**  And then that suddenly burst through and you'll get a six meter high wall of rock, mud, earth,  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:20:52):**  sand and trees and mush shooting down the valley at 120 miles an hour, six meters high.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:20:58):**  And that will just ream everything in the valley.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:21:00):**  So that's the worst case scenario.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:21:01):**  Unfortunately, that only happens once every billion years.

**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:21:08):**  slowly, whereas six meters of rock and debris is like that's lights out immediately.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:21:13):**  You won't even see it coming.

**[0:21:18-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:21:18):**  these landscapes as sort of like a young permaculture lesson, you're just looking by dead fly gullies  
**[0:21:24-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:21:24):**  and ridges is to understand that when these rivers get blocked up, they completely change  
**[0:21:30-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:21:30):**  course.

**[0:21:35-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:21:35):**  one of, for example, the five waterfalls that are above our heads and soon enough, those  
**[0:21:41-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:21:41):**  rivers will just, they'll just completely change course.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:21:44):**  So the landscape can be very, can change in no time at all.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:21:49):**  And we're surrounded by all around us.

**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:23:43):**  So after Hurricane Stan, we, we had a small river coming through our garden when our,  
**[0:23:48-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:23:48):**  the back of our property is a, is a sort of 40 meter long length that runs east west and  
**[0:23:56-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:23:56):**  the, and the valley runs north south.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:23:57):**  So it was perpendicular to the flow of the river.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:24:00):**  So we had to figure out what we were going to do.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:24:02):**  We were going to sell up and move out or we were going to protect and invest.

**[0:24:14-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:24:14):**  steel wall all the way along the back of the property.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:24:17):**  But what I built into it was a weak and low section.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:24:22):**  If something ever does come, like another hurricane with lots of rock and debris, it's  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:24:27):**  going to choose the lower area of, of, of the wall to hop over.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:24:32):**  At least that's my hope.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:24:33):**  It's always a bit of a lottery and, uh, the, the river will go where it's, uh, where it's  
**[0:24:40-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:24:40):**  most easily directed or where it's most easily, uh, flows.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:24:44):**  Exactly.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:24:45):**  And the trees form a great, a great, uh, barrier to that cause they're big and they take a  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:24:50):**  while to, to get knocked down by whatever it is.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:24:54):**  They will get knocked down, but there's enough flow.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:24:58):**  And uh, even one tree, it fell across the valley, across the riverbed up above and it,  
**[0:25:03-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:25:03):**  and it built up a bunch of debris and then the river hopped over.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:25:07):**  And so the night of hurricane Stan, the river was hopping all over the valley, um, based

**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:25:18):**  was reinforced concrete and that's, and with deep foundations as well.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:25:24):**  So where it was an old Adobe house, it was just washed away, uh, where there was a lot  
**[0:25:28-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:25:28):**  of big growth, old trees, uh, not that old because it is still a landslide badly, but  
**[0:25:34-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:25:34):**  lots of avocados.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:25:36):**  It was redirected around them because it would, the flow would hit them and then build up  
**[0:25:41-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:25:41):**  debris and then slide around the side of them.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:25:43):**  And that we saw that pattern again and again.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:25:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:25:46):**  And those patterns are super important to look at in Suriname where we have a huge river,  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:25:51):**  much more water in Suriname than it is in San Marcos, we're only, um, 20 minutes away  
**[0:25:56-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:25:56):**  or over a 40 minute walk.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:25:57):**  But one of the things is really interesting to look at in Suriname is all the areas that  
**[0:26:02-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:26:02):**  are kind of stripped, almost dry, but have loads of what the locals here call Kenya.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:26:09):**  It's kind of like a, um, it's, it's like a clumping grass that rolls up big and tall  
**[0:26:17-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:26:17):**  and actually makes a great building material, but it has an amazingly dense root structure.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:26:23):**  Um, and it's all the creeping rhizome, isn't it?  
**[0:26:26-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:26:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:26:27):**  So it's a creeping rhizome.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:26:28):**  Exactly.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:26:29):**  Um, but in all the areas where you see it, even though they're on Ridge lines, it's very  
**[0:26:33-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:26:33):**  obvious to look at the landscape.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:26:34):**  Once you realize what's happened, that these are areas that have been really washed out  
**[0:26:39-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:26:39):**  where all of the vegetation is.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:26:41):**  So the only thing that's in certain areas, which are obviously riverbedder or flood plains,  
**[0:26:48-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:26:48):**  this Kenya and old growth native trees are the only thing left on the landscape.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:26:54):**  Um, do you know that tells you something that Kenya can withstand these times, these types  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:26:58):**  of events, you know, um, concrete also can.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:27:03):**  Usually you want to go around doing some sort of environmental detection work after events  
**[0:27:08-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:27:08):**  of a large disturbance, whether through machinery or weather events, or in our case, a lot of  
**[0:27:14-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:27:14):**  geological events, including volcanoes, and earthquakes, of course.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:27:17):**  And the things that remain undisturbed are really worth taking note of.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:27:21):**  And the things that you don't see anymore are also worth remembering because those are  
**[0:27:25-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:27:25):**  the indications that are going to give you the clue to make better decisions for more  
**[0:27:29-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:27:29):**  resilient buildings and ecosystems moving forward.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:27:32):**  Right, because when I say that the solution to all problems is planting trees, that's  
**[0:27:36-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:27:36):**  a little bit generalistic because certain trees, for example, softwood pioneer species  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:27:43):**  are the ones that are going to get uprooted and come in through the window of your bedroom.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:27:47):**  Um, you know, whereas, uh, bamboos and these clumping rhizomes are the ones that have the  
**[0:27:54-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:27:54):**  root structures to withstand such major, such major weather events.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:27:58):**  Yeah, steep slope bamboo can actually slip off and take a whole sheet of earth with it  
**[0:28:05-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:28:05):**  that happened up above us.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:28:06):**  Well, see, that makes sense because especially in areas like this, the topsoil is not that  
**[0:28:10-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:28:10):**  deep and oftentimes you go right into bedrock and if it can soak the soil down to that point,  
**[0:28:16-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:28:16):**  it can uproot the entire structure.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:28:19):**  But certainly that's one of the things that I'm looking to build on a new landscape is  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:28:24):**  I, first of all, I look for the high spots because water is going to go for the low spots  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:28:28):**  and also what you said about checking out the contours above your land to see where  
**[0:28:32-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:28:32):**  water is going to be coming from.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:28:33):**  No point in building on a high spot if that's right in the center of a valley.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:28:38):**  Uh, so it doesn't make much sense that, but it can happen here, the landscape and does  
**[0:28:46-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:28:46):**  all sorts of things.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:28:47):**  So the thing I do is generally look for the high spot and something that I noticed when  
**[0:28:54-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:28:54):**  we were doing emergency excavations during the hurricane season, uh, trying to direct  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:29:01):**  flows was it is very quick to actually dig out a valley in the material you take out.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:29:06):**  You just hop to the side and boom, you get the benefit of that material up to the side.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:29:10):**  So it deepens the valley effectively.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:29:12):**  And so what I tend to do is look for a high spot and then build it up even higher, higher  
**[0:29:16-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:29:16):**  using the land from the sides.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:29:20):**  And that makes a higher spot.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:29:21):**  And then if anything does come, it'll slip around to either side of it.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:29:25):**  And they'll also sink very deep foundations.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:29:28):**  So that if it does start excavating, because this is another important thing is that when  
**[0:29:32-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:29:32):**  a flow, a river flow or a catastrophic flow of, uh, comes from a hurricane, they're called  
**[0:29:39-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:29:39):**  catastrophic flows is going down a valley or down a slope where it is less steep.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:29:48):**  It will deposit matter where it is steeper, it will actually cut in.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:29:52):**  So depending on how steep it is, uh, it will cut or it will deposit.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:29:58):**  So you want to be careful if you're trying to, uh, build in the middle of quite a flat  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:30:04):**  area and there could be a catastrophic flow, um, be extra careful because it can actually  
**[0:30:09-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:30:09):**  deposit up around it and then bury your house.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:30:12):**  And that's what happened up at the valley here with Morton's house.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:30:15):**  And he actually filled his entire house.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:30:17):**  But it was built with concrete and steel and they just dug it out.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:30:21):**  They literally sent up a team of guys and they spent months digging it out.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:30:26):**  And you're really, you're the best advocate for natural building.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:30:30):**  The best thing to do is to build on the ridges like the locals do.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:30:34):**  They've been there for years.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:30:35):**  I mean, just don't build in the landslide valley in the first place, but if you do,  
**[0:30:40-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:30:40):**  this is how to do it.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:30:44):**  If you make an insane decision, uh, around where to build your house, call Charlie.

**[0:31:06-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:31:06):**  moving.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:31:07):**  We've got a couple of new animals.

**[0:31:12-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:31:12):**  ghost?

**[0:31:23-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:31:23):**  We're just addicts to continually try to add one more species.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:31:27):**  We just love animals.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:31:28):**  Yeah, we do.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:31:29):**  Um, you know, the gold scan because we, we, we bought a bunch of, uh, chickens, local  
**[0:31:35-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:31:35):**  heirloom chickens.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:31:36):**  And then, uh, we, in Ireland, we say we got sold a pup.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:31:41):**  We had the guy, the guy who sold them to us for a really great price.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:31:45):**  I didn't realize that it was because of the 15 of them, eight, no, of the 10 of them,  
**[0:31:51-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:31:51):**  six of them were, uh, were machos.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:31:55):**  So we ate a bunch of them.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:31:57):**  Uh, that was, that was delicious.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:32:00):**  And, uh, we actually traded one of them with a, with a local neighbor of ours who has ducks  
**[0:32:04-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:32:04):**  and you know, Ireland is so good for, for building ponds on, uh, we've put in our first  
**[0:32:10-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:32:10):**  natural pond.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:32:11):**  And like I say, and that sweet spot below the house, we're going to put another one.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:32:14):**  Um, so now that we have the docs, it's like extra motivation to get, get those wetland  
**[0:32:19-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:32:19):**  systems in.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:32:20):**  Uh, but for now they're just chilling with our, with our chickens in our, in our deep  
**[0:32:24-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:32:24):**  composting house.

**[0:32:29-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:32:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:32:30):**  The interactions between the goats, the chickens and the ducks is, it looks like quite a lot  
**[0:32:37-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:32:37):**  of the time.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:32:38):**  Um, the goats are doing great.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:32:42):**  They're loving rainy season.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:32:43):**  They go out and, and, and range on, on the common lands on actually a lot of these floods  
**[0:32:48-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:32:48):**  zones where there's not that much, um, where there aren't that many crops planted.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:32:54):**  And so they're going out, they're bro, they're browsing and you know, anyone who's ever,  
**[0:32:59-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:32:59):**  it was ever starting a farm.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:33:01):**  I really recommend, uh, going one system at a time.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:33:05):**  So, you know, with our goats, we got them producing a lot of milk.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:33:08):**  We got them very healthy.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:33:10):**  Um, but then picking a couple of value added products that, that sell well was really important.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:33:17):**  So I've been like doing a lot of experimentation in the kitchen.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:33:20):**  Um, and it took us maybe a couple of months to get it right, but we've got a really, really  
**[0:33:26-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:33:26):**  nice feta cheese, uh, that's come out, which I think we're going to put a video up on YouTube  
**[0:33:31-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:33:31):**  and how to make that for anyone who's going to do goats and produce like good raw milk  
**[0:33:37-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:33:37):**  and goats are just adorable.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:33:38):**  Um, there as a livestock animal, really, really easy to manage.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:33:43):**  Um, and you know, almost free, almost free to feed, which is, you know, for me, such  
**[0:33:51-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:33:51):**  a big, big part of permaculture because they go out, they browse on the land, they eat  
**[0:33:55-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:33:55):**  all these pioneer species, high mineral plants.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:33:58):**  They bring them back and they deposit that manure in, in our, in our animal polyculture  
**[0:34:06-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:34:06):**  system, which, you know, an extra, an extra project that we've started working on, which  
**[0:34:12-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:34:12):**  we're going to talk about a little bit now is, is, is the production of, um, of organic  
**[0:34:16-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:34:16):**  compost, bocashees we call them.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:34:19):**  Um, and, and the goats and their mineral browsing is key to that, but you know, we've set our  
**[0:34:24-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:34:24):**  animal system up so that the goats are on the highest part of the land, and then it  
**[0:34:28-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:34:28):**  falls down into a two tier, uh, chicken house.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:34:32):**  Um, so we follow a kind of, uh, Joel Salatin talks about this a lot, this kind of principle  
**[0:34:37-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:34:37):**  that omnivore follows herbivore.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:34:39):**  So our chickens can come in and out as they want of the goat house.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:34:42):**  The goats can't go the other way because there's a little gap under the door.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:34:45):**  So chickens come out, come in and scratch, being in the goat house all the time.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:34:49):**  But then every week we clean the goat house out and throw it into the first tier of a  
**[0:34:54-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:34:54):**  two tier chicken house.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:34:56):**  And that two tier chicken house is a set of two terraces and each terrace is excavated  
**[0:35:00-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:35:00):**  down about 80 centimeters and then has a, has a wall built up about 50 centimeters above  
**[0:35:07-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:35:07):**  that.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:35:08):**  So we've got, you know, uh, like a meter and a half of organic material that the chickens  
**[0:35:13-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:35:13):**  are just on top of all the time.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:35:14):**  So we essentially clean the goat house out onto the first level of the chicken house  
**[0:35:18-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:35:18):**  and then clean the second level of chicken house onto the, uh, the first level of the  
**[0:35:22-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:35:22):**  chicken house onto the second level of the chicken house.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:35:24):**  And we do, um, we activate microorganisms.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:35:27):**  And so every time we're moving one level to the other, we inoculate with microorganisms  
**[0:35:32-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:35:32):**  and then we, at the end, what comes out down the bottom of the chicken house is really  
**[0:35:36-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:35:36):**  high quality, um, Bokashi, uh, you know, which just really means, um, microbially activated  
**[0:35:45-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:35:45):**  compost.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:35:46):**  Um, and yeah, all of our, and it's a great system because all of our food waste goes  
**[0:35:52-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:35:52):**  in there.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:35:53):**  We don't really turn compost piles as such.  
**[0:35:55-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:35:55):**  We just really flip it from one level to the next.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:35:58):**  Um, and it's just, yeah, everything goes in there.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:36:01):**  We, we, we, we weed in the garden, it goes in there.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:36:04):**  Our kitchen scraps go in there.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:36:06):**  The kitchen scraps from our neighbors go in there.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:36:08):**  Um, and it's the more, the better essentially.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:36:13):**  And that goes nicely with a kind of a joint venture that we've just started with Charlie,  
**[0:36:18-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:36:18):**  which we're going to talk about a little bit.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:36:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:36:21):**  But before we get to that, let me give you some updates on the house.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:36:23):**  So as Neil talked about that issue with erosion and the potential of having water flows coming  
**[0:36:28-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:36:28):**  into the back of our house has been extremely pressing and definitely taken some precedent.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:36:33):**  But in the meantime, uh, Neil, you finally got moved into your house.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:36:37):**  How does it feel to be out of a tent finally?  
**[0:36:40-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:36:40):**  Oh my God.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:36:41):**  Amazing.

**[0:37:23-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:37:23):**  Um, congratulations, Neil.

**[0:37:31-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:37:31):**  Um, when she went away to, uh, you went to wait to Columbia where she's from for the

**[0:37:51-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:37:51):**  It doesn't necessarily grow on you.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:37:53):**  Um, but, uh, you know, I, I, I've been working quite hard.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:37:58):**  I'm, I'm a mediocre carpenter at best, but Charlie let me use his workshop to get our  
**[0:38:02-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:38:02):**  doors built.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:38:04):**  And I didn't want to move in until everything was almost right, because one of the interesting  
**[0:38:09-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:38:09):**  things about having an entirely naturally built house with mud walls is that every time  
**[0:38:14-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:38:14):**  you do anything, some of the mud crumbles down on top of you.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:38:17):**  So you don't really want to be living there while you're running electrical cable or putting  
**[0:38:22-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:38:22):**  in stairs or doing any of the other things that I was doing because your bed and your  
**[0:38:27-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:38:27):**  clothes and everything else just fills up with mud.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:38:30):**  But, uh, I raced against the clock and, and with Oliver's help and, and, and with Charlie's  
**[0:38:36-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:38:36):**  generosity of using his workshop, I got everything put in, um, to a very basic standard.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:38:43):**  And Adriana has been back now for a week and has just been, she's an amazing artist and,  
**[0:38:49-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:38:49):**  um, she makes mandalas and paintings.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:38:52):**  And so she's been having a blast decorating the place.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:38:55):**  And I cannot describe to you the joy of waking up every morning in a house on a mattress  
**[0:39:02-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:39:02):**  with, with, you know, it it's, it's amazing, but you know, everything is relative.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:39:07):**  So I read the process has been beautiful of, of going from the extremely rustic and having  
**[0:39:13-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:39:13):**  nothing to know, just having what is still quite a basic house.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:39:17):**  Um, but my God, does it make you appreciate the little things?  
**[0:39:21-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:39:21):**  Well, so that's the point, right?  
**[0:39:22-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:39:22):**  So I've actually been living in my portion of the house for a couple of months now.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:39:26):**  I am not preparing it for another person at the moment.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:39:30):**  So I just got right in even before the second floor was in.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:39:33):**  And the cool thing about that is with every new advancement and every new part that you  
**[0:39:38-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:39:38):**  install, it's a whole new revelation.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:39:41):**  It's like, Oh my God, I have lights and all of these really basic things that you take  
**[0:39:45-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:39:45):**  for granted when you've lived in a, you know, a well furnished, comfortable house for most  
**[0:39:48-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:39:48):**  of your life.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:39:51):**  We have a shared, well, we have an outdoor shower.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:39:53):**  We have a shared, um, dry toilet at the moment.  
**[0:39:56-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:39:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:39:57):**  So the next priority is putting in private bathrooms behind each of these, uh, units  
**[0:40:01-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:40:01):**  in the house that we share.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:40:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:40:03):**  It's pretty good insight into the way the human mind works.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:40:06):**  Essentially, my process seems to be, uh, one day of extreme gratitude where I think can't  
**[0:40:13-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:40:13):**  get any better, uh, followed by my, my mind starting to kick into overdrive and immediately  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:40:19):**  thinking of all the new things I need to know, be happy.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:40:24):**  Notice that when I first moved here, I moved here and I had a hole in the ground.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:40:29):**  Uh, as my bathroom, my toilet, I had no bathroom at all.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:40:34):**  Apart from that, uh, as big open air sink with no water and uh, a roof and walls.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:40:44):**  And then I met my neighbor Gabby who I'm now, uh, been married to for 14 years and uh, she  
**[0:40:51-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:40:51):**  had a bathroom.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:40:52):**  She had a bathroom with a shower and a flush toilet.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:40:56):**  I remember looking at that thing going, Oh my God, I've moved it in here.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:41:00):**  And then six months later, so that was what clinched it for you.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:41:04):**  Gabby's bathroom.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:41:05):**  When you're married 14 years later, you know, you can just build one of those.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:41:11):**  Yeah, then you went pro with it.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:41:17):**  We had eight months without electricity.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:41:19):**  I remember hooking up electricity and then about another six months later we got internet  
**[0:41:25-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:41:25):**  and uh, and yeah, it's been downhill from there, but uh, I will say that nothing else  
**[0:41:32-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:41:32):**  to look forward to Charlie, you overdid it.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:41:34):**  Well, like my sister, I only, if only you had a flat screen TV, then you'd be happy.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:41:38):**  Well, it's got that now, but you still miss me.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:41:46):**  This is why we hang out with Charlie by the way, he's got all this nice stuff that we  
**[0:41:49-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:41:49):**  don't have.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:41:50):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:41:51):**  If he was a woman, we'd have considered marrying him.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:41:53):**  At least I've dealt most stuff out of wood.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:41:57):**  But uh, I, I did notice that even though I, I have this ideal of the hunter gatherer society  
**[0:42:05-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:42:05):**  in the four hour day and uh, enjoying, enjoying going back to basics.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:42:13):**  I'm from London, I'm from the city and I brought this technology with you.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:42:18):**  It has this, this strong desire and it's an interesting tension between a natural desire  
**[0:42:25-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:42:25):**  to make life comfortable and letting go of the things that really aren't that necessary.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:42:31):**  Yeah, that's one of the things I think all of us have had some good perspective on.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:42:35):**  I mean, I basically lived out of a backpack for about 13 years of travel and I've spent  
**[0:42:40-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:42:40):**  cumulatively years of my life living in tents out in a back country, work spots and national  
**[0:42:45-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:42:45):**  parks building trails.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:42:47):**  Neil, you've certainly spent enough time in a tent as well.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:42:51):**  And yeah, like you said, we have different ways of going about it.

**[0:42:58-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:42:58):**  It's doesn't have windows.

**[0:43:05-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:43:05):**  And then you just put it off for a really long time and it's like, yeah, I've got a  
**[0:43:08-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:43:08):**  house at the end, which is pretty sweet too.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:43:10):**  But I also want to clear up for the record, you were saying that the walls were all kind

**[0:43:23-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:43:23):**  It's still unplastered, bahareke, which definitely will crumble because it's very rough.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:43:28):**  Yeah, that's what I mean.

**[0:43:49-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:43:49):**  We've talked a lot about the development of the farm.

**[0:44:17-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:44:17):**  gardening services to your already, you know, overfilled work schedule as a contractor?  
**[0:44:24-0:44:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:44:24):**  The overfill overfilled work schedule is what got me into the gardening business.

**[0:44:39-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:44:39):**  Snow Tech.

**[0:44:46-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:44:46):**  Garden and when I got actually front front driveway clearance, it's very unglamorous  
**[0:44:53-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:44:53):**  job, but he lived up in the Lake Tahoe area and he got into the maintenance business basically  
**[0:45:02-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:45:02):**  and made a lot of money doing that and managed to retire at a young age because of how successful  
**[0:45:10-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:45:10):**  it was.

**[0:45:18-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:45:18):**  it's actually essential ongoing one.

**[0:45:52-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:45:52):**  And then we have I have to look for the next job.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:45:55):**  I have that anxiety.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:45:57):**  I have not been able to put away much in savings because a highly competitive industry.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:46:03):**  And I'm 46 years old now.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:46:06):**  And while I'm still in relatively good health, knock on wood, I don't know how much longer  
**[0:46:12-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:46:12):**  that'll help.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:46:13):**  But that'll go on.

**[0:46:16-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:46:16):**  But nonetheless, I need to start looking at the longer term reality that I am aging and  
**[0:46:23-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:46:23):**  that I can't keep doing this forever.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:46:25):**  It's an oddly vulnerable answer for why you want to get into gardening.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:46:29):**  Well, it's true.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:46:30):**  I love gardening.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:46:31):**  I am not a natural gardener, though.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:46:34):**  I am a natural builder.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:46:36):**  And problem solving.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:46:39):**  But I also do have to integrate my buildings with the landscape.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:46:43):**  I love nature.

**[0:46:45-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:46:45):**  And I something I love about natural building is that it's it's actually a very sustainable  
**[0:46:49-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:46:49):**  way of integrating our existence with nature and deep, profound respect for mother nature  
**[0:46:57-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:46:57):**  and and how we are deeply interdependent with with nature.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:47:04):**  So it's always been I did realize when I came here when I first moved here, I suddenly had  
**[0:47:12-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:47:12):**  the responsibility of taking care of about half an acre of land.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:47:17):**  And I realized that it took a lot of work and I wasn't very good at it.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:47:21):**  I was much better at building things.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:47:23):**  So I stuck to that.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:47:25):**  But I, I really do want the land to be productive.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:47:29):**  I had this fantasy, but that's not my culture.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:47:31):**  I grew up in London, I, I know how to negotiate tube trains.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:47:37):**  And I know how to get a seat on a tube train.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:47:39):**  But it's not very helpful when it comes to regenerating soil fertility, for example.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:47:44):**  I soon found out that the first crop of bananas was great, but then the rain here just washes  
**[0:47:49-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:47:49):**  that right away.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:47:51):**  And you've got to come up with compost.  
**[0:47:52-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:47:52):**  And I didn't have a system and and Shad came along and he showed me a lot about how to  
**[0:48:00-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:48:00):**  how to take care of the garden.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:48:01):**  But still, I realized just how much work it takes.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:48:03):**  And the saying that really comes to mind here is that the best fertilizer is the garden  
**[0:48:10-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:48:10):**  of shadow.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:48:11):**  But I was so busy that I didn't have any that my garden never had my shadow on it.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:48:15):**  So it just withered and died.

**[0:48:23-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:48:23):**  It's actually this acknowledgement that most everybody actually wants to have a nice garden  
**[0:48:29-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:48:29):**  that has food and is abundant and is beautiful.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:48:33):**  But very few people in the modern world have to dedicate to it.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:48:37):**  So what we're trying to put together is, is a service that lets people have this, lets

**[0:48:59-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:48:59):**  But although we have this like 12 months of, of, of, of sun and no frost and an unending

**[0:49:13-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:49:13):**  Your compost will decompose in no time.

**[0:49:22-0:49:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:49:22):**  over my, over my life is that, you know, what I see time and time again is this initial  
**[0:49:27-0:49:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:49:27):**  enthusiasm wears off after a little bit.  
**[0:49:32-0:49:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:49:32):**  And even though you can make the garden really nice, most people don't want to turn compost  
**[0:49:37-0:49:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:49:37):**  piles or look after animals, which is where most of your fertility comes from.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:49:41):**  They don't want to be married to that.

**[0:49:49-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:49:49):**  really nice gardens for people.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:49:50):**  And then with our, with a team of, of, of, of really of locals that we're working hard  
**[0:49:57-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:49:57):**  to train right now, have them look after the maintenance so that people can enjoy this.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:50:03):**  And it goes hand in hand also with, with training and capacity locals who are hungry for these  
**[0:50:09-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:50:09):**  kinds of opportunities.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:50:10):**  And, and a lot of young kids in this, in this valley are really, really want these opportunities.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:50:15):**  Yeah, that's something that I found there's a lot of people here with some really good  
**[0:50:22-0:50:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:50:22):**  basic experience, but they lack the training in, in more advanced permaculture skills.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:50:30):**  And especially in the, in the, all the technology and information that's become available thanks  
**[0:50:36-0:50:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:50:36):**  to the internet and thanks to podcasts like this, that all this knowledge sharing that's  
**[0:50:42-0:50:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:50:42):**  happening.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:50:43):**  And so I learned a lot of the basic skills and I saw that also not that many people actually  
**[0:50:50-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:50:50):**  have that talent for gardening.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:50:52):**  And I've been very lucky to over time come across and work with several individuals who,  
**[0:50:59-0:51:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:50:59):**  who do seem to have the talents and training for that.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:51:02):**  So some modest training here.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:51:05):**  And what I hope to do is actually contribute our organization and our access to, to the,  
**[0:51:11-0:51:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:51:11):**  to the market here, cause we've got a very distinct market here in, in Natick land, which  
**[0:51:16-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:51:16):**  is a lot of people are moving down here because it's a beautiful place to live.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:51:21):**  And because Donald Trump is president of the United States, that's great for business,  
**[0:51:28-0:51:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:51:28):**  but thank you, Donald.

**[0:51:42-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:51:42):**  beautiful landscapes down here.

**[0:51:51-0:51:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:51:51):**  is up north right now.

**[0:51:53-0:51:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:51:53):**  A lot of the foreigners move down here.  
**[0:51:58-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:51:58):**  Don understands.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:51:59):**  It's a little easier to take, I think.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:52:03):**  I think also something that I've noticed here is that there's a very common pattern here  
**[0:52:10-0:52:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:52:10):**  and amongst people who do move down here, which is that many of them are absent for  
**[0:52:15-0:52:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:52:15):**  the, for the rainy season.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:52:17):**  For some reason they don't like the rain.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:52:19):**  It's actually one of my favorite times of the year.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:52:21):**  Like surprising a lot of sun.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:52:26):**  People don't give credit to the rainy season.  
**[0:52:27-0:52:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:52:27):**  Doesn't mean it rains all the time.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:52:28):**  I mean you get the bad week or two where it's cloudy, but usually you have more than half  
**[0:52:33-0:52:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:52:33):**  of the day, sunny and fantastic.  
**[0:52:36-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:52:36):**  And the garden looks a lot greener as well.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:52:38):**  So it's a lot different.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:52:40):**  Nonetheless, there are these periods where these people's houses and gardens are left  
**[0:52:45-0:52:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:52:45):**  vacant for long periods and they need maintenance, especially if it's going to look beautiful  
**[0:52:50-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:52:50):**  for when they come back.  
**[0:52:52-0:53:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:52:52):**  And so we have this opportunity now where there are these talented people looking for  
**[0:53:00-0:53:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:53:00):**  work and there are these people looking for beautiful gardens and they also all have this  
**[0:53:05-0:53:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:53:05):**  dream of somehow having a productive garden that they can go out and pick their salad,  
**[0:53:13-0:53:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:53:13):**  pick their vegetables, pick their fruit from the trees.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:53:18):**  And it can be that way if it's well organized.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:53:21):**  However it's not just going to happen between what the conventional model is of a person  
**[0:53:28-0:53:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:53:28):**  who doesn't speak very good Spanish coming down and hiring somebody who they can barely  
**[0:53:33-0:53:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:53:33):**  communicate with and then trying to organize a productive garden with.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:53:39):**  It's going to work, especially in their absence and then they can somehow harvest wonderful,  
**[0:53:46-0:53:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:53:46):**  bountiful harvests from.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:53:49):**  And in fact what tends to happen is miscommunication, frustration, exploitation and all sorts of  
**[0:53:56-0:53:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:53:56):**  other bad things.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:53:57):**  So I hope that this can be a bridge between that situation and a brighter future.  
**[0:54:03-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:54:03):**  Yeah I mean Charlie is listing off a whole lot of factors that are pretty unique to our  
**[0:54:08-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:54:08):**  area.

**[0:54:13-0:54:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:54:13):**  the points in the marketplace are calling for the services that you can offer and do  
**[0:54:17-0:54:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:54:17):**  so at a high quality and ecological way.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:54:21):**  And one of the reasons that we kind of on the abundant edge side are really excited  
**[0:54:25-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:54:25):**  about this is you know we only have a half an acre of a farm.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:54:29):**  The amount that we can produce as far as wholesale foods and farm goods is going to be limited

**[0:54:56-0:55:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mitigating-natural-disasters-and-forming-a-permaculture-landscaping-collaboration-rrt-8/#t=0:54:56):**  that we can produce one of our biggest opportunities is to sell high quality propagated plants

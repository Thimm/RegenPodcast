**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:02:15):**  Now last week I started off this series on the regenerative design process, first focusing  
**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:02:20):**  on small scale and residential properties.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:02:23):**  Now let's take the next step up and look into homesteads.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:02:27):**  Homesteading is something of a unique concept to colonial American culture, and the term  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:02:31):**  was coined during the homesteading acts of the 1860s.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:02:35):**  That said, there are plenty of similar concepts in other parts of the world.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:02:38):**  The ones that I'm most familiar with personally are smallholdings and crofts from England  
**[0:02:43-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:02:43):**  and Scotland respectively.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:02:45):**  In general though, the homestead refers to a home and a plot of land, where the residents  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:02:50):**  work to provide a large portion of what they consume, and it usually includes some small  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:02:54):**  production or service enterprises such as growing and processing food for market, crafts  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:02:59):**  and artisan goods, and services like repair and fabrication.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:03:03):**  The distinction that is often made these days is that of whether or not the enterprises  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:03:07):**  in the home and on the land are primarily for sale or for use and consumption by the  
**[0:03:12-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:03:12):**  residents.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:03:13):**  In today's session, I'll be speaking with Drew Grimm, a long time homesteader and educator,  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:03:18):**  and the co-founder of The Schoolhouse Life with his wife Lacey.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:03:22):**  He has been formally trained in permaculture design, regenerative agriculture, and holistic  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:03:26):**  management, and he uses those trainings along with years of experience to coach people in  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:03:30):**  how to live a more connected life as a homesteader or a farmer.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:03:34):**  A life where everyday decisions look holistically at the land, livestock, and farmer, both physically  
**[0:03:40-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:03:40):**  and spiritually.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:03:41):**  In this interview, Drew and I talk about some of the common motivators for people moving  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:03:45):**  to more remote areas and working to become more self-sufficient.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:03:49):**  Much of this, of course, is connected to fears and uncertainty in the wake of the pandemic,  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:03:54):**  but a lot also come from environmental, better health, and even personal interests and goals  
**[0:03:58-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:03:58):**  as well.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:04:00):**  We talk about the need for realistic expectations and easing into the lifestyle rather than  
**[0:04:04-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:04:04):**  jumping in the deep end without any experience.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:04:07):**  From there, Drew tells me about how he has learned to manage his time with all of the  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:04:11):**  unending projects and tasks that their home and their land require, and how he has learned  
**[0:04:17-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:04:17):**  to manage it all holistically.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:04:19):**  We also spend a good bit of time talking about the community aspect of homesteading, which  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:04:23):**  often seems somewhat antithetical to the idea of moving away from people and becoming self-sufficient.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:04:28):**  But from my own experience, and Drew's as well, we found that building a strong community  
**[0:04:33-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:04:33):**  is as essential as a good food supply.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:04:36):**  Drew and I have been through many of the same trainings and design programs, and I loved  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:04:40):**  hearing how he's used permaculture design and holistic management principles, among  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:04:44):**  others, to create the life that he and his wife have always wanted for their family.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:04:49):**  Now if you're really interested in starting to live a more self-sufficient life and are  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:04:52):**  looking into homesteading, be sure to stick around to the end of the episode where I'll  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:04:56):**  tell you where you can get a free copy of my practical guide on homesteading called  
**[0:05:00-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:05:00):**  Homesteading for Every Home.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:05:02):**  So without further ado, here is Drew Grimm.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:05:07):**  So Drew, I'm really pleased to have you here.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:05:09):**  And though I'm not nearly as familiar with your work in the past, I know you've been  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:05:13):**  homesteading for a long time.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:05:15):**  Can you give us a bit of a background on how you got started and where you're at now?  
**[0:05:20-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:05:20):**  Yeah, so our background in homesteading kind of comes from just a look at, you know, where  
**[0:05:28-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:05:28):**  was our food coming from?  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:05:29):**  What were we, what kind of impact were we making in the world?  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:05:32):**  And as we started kind of planning like our family life after we got married, we kind  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:05:38):**  of just started really thinking about like, what makes a healthy human being?  
**[0:05:42-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:05:42):**  What makes a good person?  
**[0:05:44-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:05:44):**  And really wanted to take responsibility for the food production in our lives.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:05:51):**  And then making an effort to influence our community in a positive way, you know, teaching  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:05:58):**  other people how to homestead, how to grow their own food, that sort of thing.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:06:03):**  So it really like evolved from, you know, we lived in like a little apartment, and we  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:06:08):**  had like, steps outside of the apartment, and we grew like as much food as we could  
**[0:06:13-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:06:13):**  in all these little tiny pots going up the steps.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:06:16):**  And, you know, from there to a urban setting where we had a quarter acre lot, and we had  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:06:22):**  chickens and bees, and we were selling at the farmers market just turned our whole backyard  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:06:26):**  into like, you know, little mini urban farmstead.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:06:30):**  And then we were able fortunate enough to find a piece of property out in the country  
**[0:06:35-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:06:35):**  and have grown, we're on 15 acres now, and have cows, chickens, pigs, sheep, so you name  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:06:45):**  an animal, we've had it at some point, we're kind of kind of refining what we have now,  
**[0:06:50-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:06:50):**  but yeah, kind of do the whole thing.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:06:53):**  So you sort of eased your way into this coming up with an initial vision, but without throwing  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:06:57):**  yourself into it the way a lot of people are trying to do now.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:07:00):**  Is that what you recommend to people who kind of have this vision of homesteading, but haven't  
**[0:07:05-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:07:05):**  tried it out before?  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:07:07):**  Yeah, so it was, we hit this critical point in our kind of homesteading journey where  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:07:12):**  we were living in the city on this quarter acre lot.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:07:15):**  And all we wanted to, you hear this a lot from homesteaders, all we wanted to do was  
**[0:07:19-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:07:19):**  get a piece of property, but it was like, you know, first of all, affording it, and  
**[0:07:23-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:07:23):**  then, you know, second of all, finding it, especially right now, it's almost impossible.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:07:28):**  But so we hit this kind of critical point where we're like, you know what, instead of  
**[0:07:32-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:07:32):**  like waiting, let's just do what we can on our property where we are.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:07:38):**  And I think like, that's advice that we give to a lot of people is just start where you  
**[0:07:43-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:07:43):**  are in on a quarter acre or even in an apartment, you have to get very disciplined with, you  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:07:50):**  know, especially in the permaculture principles, it just fits so well, like, get very disciplined,  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:07:55):**  very intensive, very tight groupings of plants and stack everything.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:08:00):**  And you can grow a lot on a small piece of property.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:08:05):**  And it gives you the practice of when you get out to 15 acres, what you see a lot of  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:08:10):**  people as they like, put their garden like 10 acres away, and you know, then they have  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:08:15):**  like an orchard somewhere else and everything just gets spread out.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:08:19):**  If you get that discipline of growing tightly, then you have it to where if you grew on 15  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:08:26):**  acres, like you grow on a quarter acre, I mean, you'd have, you could feed your whole  
**[0:08:30-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:08:30):**  city, you know, I mean, so I we highly recommend starting small starting with what you can  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:08:37):**  do where you are.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:08:40):**  For sure.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:08:41):**  And I've done that same thing with clients in the past.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:08:42):**  And that really echoes the exact same advice that Rob Avis from verge permaculture in the  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:08:46):**  last interview was talking about as well, that with the luxury of space, you often start  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:08:52):**  to misuse it for for having more of the resource than you know what to do with, like you said,  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:08:58):**  putting things in inconvenient locations and spreading them out unnecessarily because you  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:09:03):**  haven't had to think through all of the practicalities of how are you going to get over there, the  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:09:08):**  efficiency of moving things around, and having that practice of what seems like a limitation  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:09:14):**  of space can get you into the mindset of working with limited resources.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:09:20):**  And it works the same with money too.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:09:23):**  If you have a whole bunch of money, people just tend to throw it around and try and solve  
**[0:09:27-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:09:27):**  problems with it without thinking them through really well.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:09:30):**  Well, we've been we've been poking the bear here recently in a couple homesteading groups,  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:09:34):**  we just released a podcast on why you shouldn't have a tractor.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:09:38):**  And if you if you want to see homesteaders get mad, go into a group and tell them they  
**[0:09:43-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:09:43):**  shouldn't have a tractor.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:09:45):**  But it's the same thing as what you're saying.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:09:47):**  Like a tractor should be something if you're going to get one, in my opinion, like 10 years  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:09:52):**  down the road, but learn that discipline up front of not having a tractor create systems  
**[0:09:57-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:09:57):**  where you're not dependent on diesel fuel and things like that.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:10:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:10:01):**  Well, so you're pretty well connected with the homesteading community in the United States  
**[0:10:05-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:10:05):**  at this point.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:10:06):**  And though I remember it fondly from when I used to live back there, I have seen a lot  
**[0:10:10-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:10:10):**  of different iterations of how cultures around the world relate to living off the land and  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:10:14):**  having community and self sufficiency based in place.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:10:18):**  It's a bit different than the American cultural version of it.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:10:22):**  Have you noticed some really unique aspects in the motivations of why people want to get  
**[0:10:28-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:10:28):**  out of, let's say, urban or suburban areas and what it is they really want to accomplish?  
**[0:10:35-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:10:35):**  That's interesting.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:10:36):**  I feel like since the pandemic hit, it's been it's been very different.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:10:42):**  I'd say pre pandemic, you know, we've been kind of homesteading, quote unquote, for like  
**[0:10:47-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:10:47):**  20 years now.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:10:49):**  Pre pandemic, I would say it was it was just people wanting to have kind of a country lifestyle.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:10:58):**  Generally, just living off the land, having good access to food.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:11:05):**  Post or in the pandemic, I don't know if we can say post pandemic, right?  
**[0:11:11-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:11:11):**  I see more people like the prepper kind of people more coming into it, people that want  
**[0:11:18-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:11:18):**  it's kind of one in the same in a way.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:11:21):**  I mean, people want to know where their food comes from.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:11:23):**  But people start panicking a little bit more when you go in, like, I don't know how it  
**[0:11:28-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:11:28):**  is where you are.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:11:29):**  But like our grocery stores, a lot of times now there's stuff you just don't you can't  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:11:33):**  get like my wife sent me over there to get cream cheese the other day.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:11:37):**  And there's just not cream cheese.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:11:39):**  And there hasn't been for like two weeks.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:11:41):**  The meat shelves are kind of empty now.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:11:45):**  So I think people are starting to associate like all of a sudden they're like, wait, where  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:11:51):**  does my food come from? and can I take some responsibility for providing food for my family  
**[0:11:56-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:11:56):**  or, you know, for our community?  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:11:59):**  So I've seen a shift in like, people starting to realize that there might not just be a  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:12:05):**  constant stream of food, and maybe they should take some responsibility for that.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:12:10):**  For sure.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:12:11):**  Yeah, that's been a big motivation since the pandemic started.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:12:14):**  Like, I've seen the same thing with the prepper community getting much more involved with  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:12:18):**  homesteading, and not just, you know, stocking up on weapons and provisions, but actually  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:12:23):**  writing it, okay, longer term, I am going to have to make some of this stuff.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:12:27):**  And I also don't want to try and do so on a completely degraded landscape.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:12:31):**  So how do I do so in such a way that actually cares for the resources under management.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:12:36):**  And you and I have both actually, we were talking about this before, gone through very  
**[0:12:40-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:12:40):**  similar trainings, both permaculture, now holistic management, and these types of designs.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:12:47):**  I've done homesteading in the past, I'm looking to do a certain version of it soon in the  
**[0:12:51-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:12:51):**  future as I move on to a new property.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:12:54):**  And I'm really interested in what your idea of a holistic homestead looks like, coming  
**[0:13:01-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:13:01):**  from all of these different design philosophies and management ideas that differs from what  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:13:07):**  you see most people talking about when they refer to homesteading.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:13:10):**  Yeah, so I would say like, off the bat, the first thing is really telling or talking with  
**[0:13:17-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:13:17):**  people about like, what their vision is like, very often, in the homestead world, I think  
**[0:13:23-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:13:23):**  people picture like a mini farm.

**[0:13:32-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:13:32):**  by 100.

**[0:13:36-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:13:36):**  And so when we start talking to people about like, their holistic vision, it's like, what  
**[0:13:43-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:13:43):**  do you want from the homestead, like, what do you want it to look like?  
**[0:13:47-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:13:47):**  What do you want it to feel like?  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:13:49):**  What kind of spiritual connection do you want to have to your land, if that's something  
**[0:13:53-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:13:53):**  that you know, that resonates with you, and helping people find that is so rewarding.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:14:00):**  One of the big challenges we do is like, whatever garden space you have, whatever perennial  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:14:06):**  space you have, whatever you need to have an area that you can sit in and enjoy that  
**[0:14:11-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:14:11):**  space.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:14:12):**  And it goes from like, if you have a 50 by 100 garden in North Carolina in August, you're  
**[0:14:19-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:14:19):**  not going to be sitting out there.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:14:20):**  It's just, you know, the mosquitoes would be eating you, you'd be burning in the sun  
**[0:14:24-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:14:24):**  sweating.

**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:14:29):**  look like to where I could enjoy sitting out there.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:14:33):**  That really gets people's wheels turning.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:14:35):**  And then the client we had not too long ago, he's, he described his as like, he wanted  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:14:40):**  it to be whimsical.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:14:42):**  And you find people more leaning towards this permaculture principles of like spirals and  
**[0:14:48-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:14:48):**  circles and when they start dreaming, instead of just trying to replicate something in like  
**[0:14:55-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:14:55):**  a commercial aspect.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:14:56):**  So we really that's kind of where we hone in on like the holistic idea of, let's bring  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:15:03):**  in everything and then not only that, but what does your community look like?  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:15:07):**  How are you connected to your community?  
**[0:15:10-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:15:10):**  Because to me, that's permaculture and holistic management in the same, you know, teaching  
**[0:15:17-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:15:17):**  people that you know, you can't just, you shouldn't try shouldn't say can't, you shouldn't  
**[0:15:23-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:15:23):**  be trying to do everything by yourself, you know, you need to be connecting with community  
**[0:15:29-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:15:29):**  on so many different levels.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:15:30):**  So helping people understand that and start looking for ways to connect with their community  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:15:36):**  is also part of the holistic planning that we go through.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:15:40):**  I don't know if it's the same with you.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:15:41):**  But I've heard from a lot of people who've reached out that some of their core motivations,  
**[0:15:45-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:15:45):**  aside from taking more control and being more resilient in what they provide for themselves  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:15:49):**  and their families, is also being a beacon for these communities that you're talking  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:15:53):**  about, and offering something to the wider population around them and playing some sort  
**[0:15:59-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:15:59):**  of role in the resilience and the security that the people around them have and being  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:16:06):**  able to collaborate beyond just having these little island homesteads where everybody has  
**[0:16:11-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:16:11):**  their little fortress and they don't share much.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:16:14):**  And it comes back to some of the early questions that I used to get a lot when I first started  
**[0:16:18-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:16:18):**  consulting, which was, you know, how much do I need to plant in order to be completely  
**[0:16:24-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:16:24):**  self sufficient in food, or, you know, this, this idea of, you know, taking care of absolutely  
**[0:16:30-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:16:30):**  everything you need.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:16:31):**  And like you said, going into these questions about bringing in everything, looking at the  
**[0:16:36-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:16:36):**  context and understanding the core motivations often breaks it down to, okay, you're either  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:16:43):**  harboring some sort of fear around lack or being without some scarcity.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:16:48):**  But your real motivation is not to do all of this on your own.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:16:53):**  It wouldn't be fun for you, you would not have at all the type of lifestyle that you  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:16:57):**  really envision in the future of being able to take time off.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:17:01):**  And there's so many aspects of being fully self-sufficient that are not desirable to  
**[0:17:05-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:17:05):**  most people, even if they like growing their own food, like creating textiles or providing  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:17:11):**  all of their energy needs, you know, it gets really, really broad and very complex.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:17:17):**  And so when you get down to the feasibility of it, there has to be some sort of collaboration  
**[0:17:24-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:17:24):**  and cooperation among the community.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:17:26):**  Now you have told me in the past that you work a lot with faith-based communities where  
**[0:17:32-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:17:32):**  you live in the United States, and that's a lot of the motivation for why people manage  
**[0:17:36-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:17:36):**  the way that they do and the way that they come together.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:17:40):**  And why don't you tell me a little bit about what that dynamic is like and how it helps  
**[0:17:43-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:17:43):**  to bring people into closer collaboration?  
**[0:17:46-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:17:46):**  Well, yeah, I think like, so we're in the south east United States, so that's, you know,  
**[0:17:54-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:17:54):**  kind of the quote unquote Bible belt.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:17:56):**  So there is a lot of that.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:18:01):**  It's interesting, again, kind of as the pandemic has developed, I feel like there's different  
**[0:18:06-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:18:06):**  groups of people kind of moving along.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:18:08):**  But yeah, there is, it's primarily Christian people that are interested.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:18:14):**  And I don't know, like, I don't know if that's fair to say, because it's mostly just Christian  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:18:18):**  people in the south, you know, so it's kind of kind of one in the same, right.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:18:23):**  But I think that Christianity in itself, like, there's good and there's bad with any religion.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:18:30):**  It promotes like, taking care of one another, taking care of your neighbor, you know, taking  
**[0:18:38-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:18:38):**  responsibility for what's going on.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:18:40):**  So in that way, I see it's a great thing.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:18:45):**  Our, us ourselves, we're Jewish.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:18:47):**  So there's like this kind of dynamic of like, Jewish people, basically, are most of our  
**[0:18:54-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:18:54):**  Bible is the same as the Christian Bible.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:18:56):**  So it's the same principles of ethics and taking care of each other.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:19:02):**  And for us, it's been a lot about connecting with the land.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:19:06):**  So the, a lot of the festivals and different things that happen within the Bible, or it's  
**[0:19:14-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:19:14):**  an agricultural people, it's an agricultural religion that has kind of evolved away from  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:19:21):**  that.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:19:22):**  But when you look at the roots of it, everything in there was developed, or all everything  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:19:27):**  that happens there is from agricultural events.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:19:32):**  So I feel like that has that connects people, I think, even at a level that maybe they don't  
**[0:19:38-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:19:38):**  realize to the land and into agriculture.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:19:42):**  Does that, does that answer your question?  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:19:44):**  Yeah, in some way, and I'm always trying to navigate these waters, too, because, you know,  
**[0:19:48-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:19:48):**  here in Spain, it's also mostly a Catholic society, although practicing, or practicing  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:19:56):**  varies among communities, and it's not nearly as religious as it used to be.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:20:00):**  It is the dominant architecture of this part of the world.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:20:04):**  And I also, so my family was just visiting actually, up until yesterday, and my sister  
**[0:20:09-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:20:09):**  is a religious scholar.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:20:11):**  And she's not Christian, she actually lives in the Middle East, so she's not Muslim either.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:20:15):**  She has studied all of these in depth and has worked a lot with faith based communities  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:20:20):**  on ways of building community together, strengthening those connections and incentivizing collaboration  
**[0:20:25-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:20:25):**  and a deep set of sort of moral framework, especially among youth in those communities.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:20:32):**  And hearing her talk, like I personally abandoned religion quite a long time ago.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:20:37):**  But I have also always felt something lacking, not really around a religious framework, so  
**[0:20:43-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:20:43):**  that is how I grew up.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:20:45):**  But that there is still a need for even secular people or people without that framework to  
**[0:20:51-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:20:51):**  draw from, to come together on conversations and yeah, a shared set of ethics and morals.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:21:02):**  It has brought people together throughout all of history.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:21:05):**  And whether you're doing that from a book that's very old or just something that you  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:21:09):**  get together on based on agreement, it does have an extremely unifying force that other  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:21:15):**  types of motivations and frameworks, in my opinion, seem to lack or are just not as strong.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:21:21):**  And yeah, I mean, thinking about it too, the fact that a lot of these are quite old philosophies  
**[0:21:28-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:21:28):**  and theologies, most people did come from a rural lifestyle and made their living off  
**[0:21:34-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:21:34):**  the land in some way, tended crops and animals.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:21:37):**  It only makes sense that a lot of the moral frameworks that came out of them are from  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:21:42):**  that context as well and continue to inform the way people manage their communities and  
**[0:21:47-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:21:47):**  their land.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:21:49):**  Have you found that this is still very relevant in the modern context or that a lot of the  
**[0:21:55-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:21:55):**  teachings from the scriptures that you have referenced to need an update in order to grapple  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:22:02):**  with some of the ecological urgencies that we're facing right now?  
**[0:22:06-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:22:06):**  You know, it's interesting.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:22:07):**  So like within my religion of Judaism, Jews are kind of notorious for questioning everything,  
**[0:22:15-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:22:15):**  right?  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:22:16):**  Like there's like the saying of you ask two rabbis and you'll get three answers.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:22:21):**  It's so there's like the framework, the one that I take issue with is like kosher.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:22:27):**  Kosher slaughter takes responsibility for how the animal is killed, but it doesn't take  
**[0:22:32-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:22:32):**  responsibility for how the animal is raised.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:22:35):**  So you know, a cow can come from a CAFO lot and be kosher slaughtered and then that animal  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:22:42):**  is considered kosher, which kosher means set apart or holy, you know, like that to me,  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:22:48):**  that animal, that ethics should be of the highest quality, you know, everything from  
**[0:22:53-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:22:53):**  how that animal is born to how that animal is raised.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:22:56):**  So I do think that there stands a lot of room for improvement on a lot of those things.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:23:03):**  But when you were talking, it was making me think of the holistic context that I think  
**[0:23:10-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:23:10):**  multiple religions could come under, you know, Alan Savory talks about like, he's, he takes  
**[0:23:17-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:23:17):**  groups of people that are at complete odds with each other, like African tribes, you  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:23:20):**  know, and has them write down a holistic context.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:23:24):**  And then all of a sudden, these tribes that have been at war with each other for years  
**[0:23:29-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:23:29):**  now are working together for a common purpose.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:23:32):**  So I think there is room for something outside of religion and that holistic context, which  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:23:41):**  I think is just fascinating, like the depth that you can go into that.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:23:46):**  Have you got to that point where you started writing out a holistic context?  
**[0:23:50-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:23:50):**  Yeah, I've done that quite a few months ago and continue to refine it.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:23:54):**  I was actually working with that framework well before I started taking the accredited  
**[0:23:59-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:23:59):**  professional training.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:24:01):**  And had, of course, started with that by understanding the ethics that my partner and I have in common,  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:24:07):**  the main motivations and drivers, even using some of the stuff that's not in the current  
**[0:24:11-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:24:11):**  iteration of the holistic management book, the newer editions.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:24:18):**  Going into the future resource base, and the quality of life statements are really something  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:24:24):**  that helped to inform the initial enterprises that we're looking to research for this new  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:24:29):**  property, the things that we want to spend our time doing, the income that we're going  
**[0:24:34-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:24:34):**  to have to generate in order to justify such a large purchase for us.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:24:39):**  And the motivations that we have beyond just what we want to do with the property for ourselves  
**[0:24:44-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:24:44):**  and what we want to produce from it.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:24:46):**  But the fact that my family is far away, and in order to be able to bring them together,  
**[0:24:51-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:24:51):**  we need a larger infrastructure than we have in our apartment right now.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:24:54):**  And us both being very family oriented and wanting to create a space where we can all  
**[0:24:59-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:24:59):**  get together again.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:25:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:25:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:25:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:25:04):**  And I just see that as kind of like a, like you were saying, like, that's a, it's something  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:25:09):**  that we can all, we don't have to have similar religions for, you know, I mean, or, or the  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:25:14):**  same religion, I should say, we can create a different structure that gives us those  
**[0:25:19-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:25:19):**  ethics to work towards that will give us, you know, hopefully, I mean, if it's written  
**[0:25:25-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:25:25):**  correctly, happiness on the property and productivity at the same time.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:25:30):**  Yeah, because it starts by focusing on the things that pretty much everybody wants for  
**[0:25:36-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:25:36):**  their lives, right?  
**[0:25:37-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:25:37):**  Right.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:25:38):**  A certain amount of security access to good resources, namely food, water, shelter, right,  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:25:42):**  the essentials.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:25:43):**  And from there, you start to build out on your unique wants and how exactly you see  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:25:47):**  that coming about.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:25:49):**  But by starting with those core necessities, it's very hard to find drastic differences  
**[0:25:55-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:25:55):**  between people.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:25:57):**  And being able to build out from that common understanding is, is got a lot of unifying  
**[0:26:03-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:26:03):**  potential, just like you were talking about.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:26:05):**  Maybe you can give me some insights from your own context that have helped to shape the  
**[0:26:09-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:26:09):**  development of your homestead.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:26:11):**  Yeah, I think for us, a big one is always behavior.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:26:16):**  So how do we want the behavior to look on our land?  
**[0:26:20-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:26:20):**  And then how do we want the behavior of like the animals in other beings on our land?  
**[0:26:28-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:26:28):**  How do we want that feel to be in the answer for us, we started with the behavior of the  
**[0:26:35-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:26:35):**  animals.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:26:36):**  So whether that's like hummingbirds, or deer, wild animals, cows, we run a wild flock.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:26:45):**  So our sheep and our cows, we stand with the belief that cows know how to be better at  
**[0:26:51-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:26:51):**  being cows than we do.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:26:53):**  So you know, they, we don't castrate, we don't separate moms from babies, we don't separate  
**[0:26:59-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:26:59):**  bulls from heifers or cows.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:27:03):**  So everybody lives together, you know, in a wild community.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:27:08):**  And that's another one of those ones where you get a little bit of flack in the homesteading  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:27:13):**  community, people are kind of used to more of a managed.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:27:17):**  So a word that within our holistic context that we try to avoid is kind of like a colonialistic  
**[0:27:26-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:27:26):**  wording.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:27:27):**  So you know, we're not at war with the weeds, and we're not fighting the deer.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:27:33):**  And you know, like, my parents have squirrels that like, continuously take the grapes off.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:27:39):**  And I'm like, you know, the other day, they were complaining about the squirrels.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:27:43):**  And then like, two days ago, they were complaining about the hawks.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:27:46):**  And I'm like, you know, there's a balance here, guys, like, we we don't have to be at  
**[0:27:50-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:27:50):**  war with nature.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:27:52):**  So within our context, that's like something that we watch and really catch ourselves on  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:27:58):**  my wife and I will like catch each other on it like, hey, you're using like a colonialistic  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:28:04):**  word on like, on whatever is going on.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:28:08):**  Like, I mean, it's tough sometimes, right?  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:28:10):**  The way we were raised, like, weeds popping up, and you want to fight back the weeds.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:28:15):**  But what if we don't say fight back the weeds?  
**[0:28:18-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:28:18):**  What do we say, work with the mulch or you know, different things.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:28:22):**  So that's been that's been a huge breaker is just changing that mindset, which falls  
**[0:28:28-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:28:28):**  in within our holistic context of how are we behaving on this land?  
**[0:28:34-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:28:34):**  Are we working in partnership with what is on this land?  
**[0:28:38-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:28:38):**  Are we trying to dominate this land?  
**[0:28:41-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:28:41):**  Yeah, that's been one of the powerful things that have come out of this training as well  
**[0:28:44-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:28:44):**  as I've gotten deeper into it.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:28:46):**  That idea of behavior, like you said, is not something that you can control outside of  
**[0:28:51-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:28:51):**  yourself.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:28:53):**  And so in order to try and coax the behavior that you want from others from other living  
**[0:28:59-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:28:59):**  beings, you have to model it.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:29:02):**  And it really brings me back to a core concept that has driven a lot of what I've tried to  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:29:06):**  do in my professional life and my relationships, especially, which is based things on integrity.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:29:11):**  It's one of those loaded words that fits in a lot of ideas and ethics that I think are  
**[0:29:16-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:29:16):**  really worth pursuing and trying to move closer towards in everything that you do, everything  
**[0:29:23-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:29:23):**  that you make and how you relate with one another.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:29:27):**  And you know, the goalposts can be moving.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:29:30):**  Right, working in integrity can look very different working with a business associate  
**[0:29:35-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:29:35):**  than it can working with an ecosystem or vice versa.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:29:40):**  And it's a matter of constantly observing and listening, which also comes up, of course,  
**[0:29:45-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:29:45):**  in permaculture design and so many other concepts and teachings, and constantly working to refine  
**[0:29:53-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:29:53):**  a sense of it's not about you.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:29:57):**  You are a cog in a wheel that can have an immense effect, but this system will continue  
**[0:30:04-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:30:04):**  without you.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:30:05):**  And in some cases, it will continue on better if you get your ego out of the situation and  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:30:09):**  listen to what this ecosystem is trying to move towards in its evolution.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:30:14):**  Can you be an asset to that?  
**[0:30:16-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:30:16):**  Or are you inflicting your own desires in a way that prevents it from actualizing its  
**[0:30:21-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:30:21):**  potential?  
**[0:30:22-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:30:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:30:23):**  I'd like to go in on this.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:30:25):**  It is, it's funny, like the integrity word, I always think about like, you can find like  
**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:30:32):**  how well you're in tune with that when you're like loading animals, loading or unloading  
**[0:30:37-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:30:37):**  animals like cattle, sheep, like, I check myself a lot there.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:30:44):**  But like, you know, like, you see those memes going around, like, if you're still together  
**[0:30:48-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:30:48):**  with your partner, after you've loaded cows, you know, you're in a good spot, right?  
**[0:30:53-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:30:53):**  I mean, it's that kind of thing.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:30:55):**  But like, the context is never push animal other than like, pull them.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:31:00):**  And sometimes that's easier said than done.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:31:03):**  But it's just, you know, another another way of, like you said, of trying to get out of  
**[0:31:07-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:31:07):**  it, maybe that cow knows something that we don't know.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:31:10):**  For sure.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:31:11):**  And that kind of leads me to another part that I wanted to focus on, which is a lot  
**[0:31:15-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:31:15):**  of the unexpected trials and challenges that come from adopting this sort of homesteading  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:31:22):**  lifestyle where you're much more responsible for the things that you consume and producing  
**[0:31:26-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:31:26):**  the things that you and your community need.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:31:29):**  I think there is especially thanks to social media, a very romanticized view of what it  
**[0:31:34-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:31:34):**  is to work the land.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:31:36):**  And there's also at the same time, a reason why rural populations have flocked towards  
**[0:31:41-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:31:41):**  cities and more consistent incomes and working hours that have an end to them.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:31:47):**  And all these other things that, you know, there's pros and cons to both.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:31:52):**  But it's very important to understand the responsibilities and the challenges that you're  
**[0:31:57-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:31:57):**  getting into when you take on responsibility for managing plants, animals and an ecosystem.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:32:05):**  Can you talk about some of the things that you really learned and had to figure out for  
**[0:32:08-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:32:08):**  yourself as you moved up the scales to the homestead you have now?  
**[0:32:12-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:32:12):**  Right.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:32:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:32:14):**  So the first one is most homesteaders, I'm going to stereotype a little bit here, but  
**[0:32:19-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:32:19):**  most homesteaders have children.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:32:21):**  So, you know, designing your systems for children, I've seen it go either way.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:32:27):**  But a lot of people get frustrated with their kids not helping and or not being able to  
**[0:32:32-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:32:32):**  help at a small age.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:32:34):**  But from the beginning, I think because we were able to scale as we had more children,  
**[0:32:40-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:32:40):**  we don't have a ton.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:32:41):**  We have four so it's not like massive amounts of kids.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:32:45):**  But building things like it's simple things like fence latches, you know, at a height  
**[0:32:51-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:32:51):**  that like a five year old can reach versus an adult building chicken tractors that, you  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:32:59):**  know, an eight year old can move versus like the massive Joel Salatin one that I can barely  
**[0:33:04-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:33:04):**  move, you know, like that was one of the things was stepping back.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:33:10):**  Seeing how can I make it so that my kids feel successful at what they're doing?  
**[0:33:17-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:33:17):**  And how I think that's an important part in a challenge if I'm studying is including your  
**[0:33:24-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:33:24):**  kids letting them see that.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:33:25):**  I think that a lot of like you kind of alluded to a lot of second generation kids leave the  
**[0:33:31-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:33:31):**  farm.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:33:32):**  And I think it's multi layered, but I think some of it is that just non stop work or that  
**[0:33:38-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:33:38):**  non stop not able to help until they're older, like, you know, giving them ownership of what  
**[0:33:46-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:33:46):**  they have.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:33:47):**  Our kids are in charge of the chickens and sell the eggs down at our roadside market,  
**[0:33:53-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:33:53):**  you know, like so giving them an enterprise and letting them be part of that.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:33:58):**  The other big issue I see with people is not designing a system where they can leave if  
**[0:34:04-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:34:04):**  they want to.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:34:05):**  So homestead, and I feel like it's pretty much true of a farm also, you almost at some  
**[0:34:12-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:34:12):**  points feel like you're tied to it like pre pandemic, we love to travel and generally  
**[0:34:17-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:34:17):**  about every two months we traveled somewhere and we leave the homestead but we designed  
**[0:34:22-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:34:22):**  systems so that one person could stop by every like three days and take care of all of our  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:34:29):**  animals.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:34:31):**  You know what, that's the watering system the feeding system, the paddocks, all of that  
**[0:34:36-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:34:36):**  was simplified so that they had the ability to be able to do it quickly and easily.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:34:44):**  So you don't have to have like a farm hand on hand but thinking about those kind of things,  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:34:50):**  I think is very important and in has been challenges.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:34:54):**  I would say the other challenge is money I mean you hear that I feel like no matter what  
**[0:34:59-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:34:59):**  you're in right you run into very few people that feel like they have enough money, but  
**[0:35:05-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:35:05):**  being able to design and build things at a low cost is, I think, important, you see a  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:35:11):**  lot of homesteaders go into just crazy amounts of debt.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:35:16):**  And I'll poke that tractor bear again like, you know, getting a homestead and then going  
**[0:35:21-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:35:21):**  into debt.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:35:22):**  Someone literally said this on my post is the first debt you should take is on a tractor  
**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:35:28):**  on your homestead, and, you know, going into debt.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:35:32):**  I'm just kind of opposed to in general but like putting that as your first priority there's  
**[0:35:37-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:35:37):**  a lot you can do before you need to go into debt and as soon as you are, it makes spending  
**[0:35:43-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:35:43):**  money on other things really difficult.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:35:45):**  So I don't know.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:35:47):**  Yeah, I am generally have that same opinion I've heard some conflicting advice on like  
**[0:35:54-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:35:54):**  trying to debt finance the regeneration of places like I've seen people do that successfully,  
**[0:36:00-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:36:00):**  especially like Mark Shepherd, who had a chance to talk with back at our conference here in  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:36:05):**  Germany a couple of months ago, and he's got a whole model on how he does that but it's  
**[0:36:10-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:36:10):**  also very important to know that you have to have a very clear plan.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:36:16):**  Yeah, and a lot very well figured out before you start doing it that way.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:36:21):**  Well, and he's got like, he's an early founder in Organic Valley.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:36:26):**  Yes.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:36:27):**  So like I tell people, you know, like, if you can have another revenue stream like that,  
**[0:36:32-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:36:32):**  you know, I mean, that's like, then yeah, it makes sense.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:36:35):**  Like if you know, but if you're coming into it and going into just crazy debt.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:36:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:36:40):**  Well, so I'm on the section in the accredited professional for holistic management where  
**[0:36:45-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:36:45):**  we're focusing on holistic financial planning.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:36:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:36:48):**  So I'm really enjoying this part because I have no financial planning in the past.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:36:54):**  And it's about time I got some.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:36:56):**  But also, there's some really great just general principles in there such as planning profit  
**[0:37:02-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:37:02):**  first and growing the difference between investments that depreciate and those that generate money  
**[0:37:09-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:37:09):**  for you.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:37:10):**  And, you know, you, there is obviously a much larger conversation to have about whether  
**[0:37:16-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:37:16):**  a tractor makes sense in a different context.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:37:19):**  But ultimately, it comes down to is this resource going to make you more money?  
**[0:37:23-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:37:23):**  Or is it just going to, you know, be a source of maintenance and constantly putting in more  
**[0:37:30-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:37:30):**  fuel and like just depreciating over time, which I mean, vehicles are very well known  
**[0:37:35-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:37:35):**  for doing.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:37:36):**  Right.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:37:37):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:37:38):**  Whether it's a tractor or a truck or an ATV or something, right?  
**[0:37:42-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:37:42):**  How well can you do without it until it's absolutely necessary and guaranteed to actually  
**[0:37:47-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:37:47):**  make you some revenue and justify that cost.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:37:50):**  That goes for a whole lot of other financial planning, everything.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:37:54):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:37:55-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:37:55):**  The other one you see a lot is fences, you know, people will Hollywood planning to it's  
**[0:38:03-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:38:03):**  like that those fences have to make you money like you've got to plan that so that that  
**[0:38:09-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:38:09):**  fence is holding in livestock that you're gonna be able to sell to, you know, generate  
**[0:38:13-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:38:13):**  revenue.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:38:14):**  So yeah, there's some tough ones there.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:38:17):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:38:18):**  And in the practical planning and kind of preparation, especially if someone's getting  
**[0:38:24-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:38:24):**  into homesteading for the first time, how do you find a balance and all of the things  
**[0:38:29-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:38:29):**  that need to get done and the things that you want for your family and your quality  
**[0:38:32-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:38:32):**  of life?  
**[0:38:33-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:38:33):**  It seems like, of course, the the chore list is never ending.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:38:36):**  But this is something that you've put a lot of thought into about how to manage that time  
**[0:38:40-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:38:40):**  and stay on top of the necessary work.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:38:43):**  Yeah, um, so we definitely apply the permaculture principle of really not doing anything for  
**[0:38:50-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:38:50):**  the first year.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:38:52):**  In that that one gets a lot of flak, you know, somebody.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:38:58):**  I mean, somebody has waited a long time to get this piece of property and they want to  
**[0:39:02-0:39:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:39:02):**  hit the ground running.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:39:03):**  And the first thing I tell them is like, let's not do anything as far as moving things or  
**[0:39:08-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:39:08):**  you know.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:39:09):**  So that that's the generally the first rule that we apply.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:39:14):**  And then as far as time management, it's really a lot about prioritizing and falling into  
**[0:39:20-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:39:20):**  that holistic manner or holistic context.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:39:23):**  What do you want out of this land?  
**[0:39:25-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:39:25):**  Like, you don't need every homestead animal that is around to be on your homestead to  
**[0:39:31-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:39:31):**  enjoy that.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:39:32):**  So let's scale it back.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:39:34):**  The other thing is we like generally encourage people to wait three years before they get  
**[0:39:39-0:39:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:39:39):**  chickens.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:39:40):**  Because again, like learning how to manage chickens properly takes a little bit of time  
**[0:39:45-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:39:45):**  learning where they would do the best on your property takes a little bit of time.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:39:49):**  So we really like, it's a very like slow steps in that direction.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:39:56):**  And that way you can build up a chore list that meets your context of like, I only have  
**[0:40:03-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:40:03):**  an hour before in the morning before I go to work for the day.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:40:08):**  You know, do you want to spend that hour doing chores?  
**[0:40:11-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:40:11):**  Or do you want to spend that hour sitting in your garden, drinking coffee, you know,  
**[0:40:15-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:40:15):**  like, those are two completely different looking homesteads.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:40:18):**  And if you stop and think about that, you can design a beautiful homestead that maybe  
**[0:40:23-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:40:23):**  just you're growing flowers in a garden.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:40:27):**  And you know, that's all you have.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:40:29):**  It doesn't have to be.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:40:31):**  I think a lot of people think, let me get a homestead attractor, some goats, and fence,  
**[0:40:36-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:40:36):**  and their life's miserable.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:40:38):**  And you know, I heard stat not too long ago that most homesteads, most homesteaders fail  
**[0:40:44-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:40:44):**  within six years.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:40:46):**  So the first two years are kind of good.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:40:48):**  And then the next four years, it's kind of like, I hate homesteading, and then let me  
**[0:40:53-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:40:53):**  sell the homestead.  
**[0:40:54-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:40:54):**  So you know, the homesteader life is not very long.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:40:57):**  And I think it's because, again, you know, they haven't stopped to look at that holistic  
**[0:41:02-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:41:02):**  context and where do I want to spend my time and how do I want it?  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:41:06):**  My wife and I have this garden space that she's created outside our back.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:41:11):**  And every morning, we sit out there and drink coffee.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:41:15):**  But it's like, there's all these flowers and things.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:41:19):**  And we watch hummingbirds and you know, like migration of birds, and we have mulberry bushes  
**[0:41:24-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:41:24):**  and like trees out there.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:41:25):**  And it's like this little Garden of Eden.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:41:27):**  But that's what we want.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:41:28):**  That's what brings us happiness.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:41:30):**  So that's like number one priority.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:41:32):**  If I'm not able to do that, then I start looking at what's not allowing me to do that and start  
**[0:41:39-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:41:39):**  weeding out those things.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:41:41):**  I really like what you're talking about there with prioritizing that year of observation.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:41:45):**  And I generally agree as well, but I also wrote an article to accompany it for those  
**[0:41:49-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:41:49):**  people who are super antsy to get started about eight things that you can do while you're  
**[0:41:54-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:41:54):**  still observing your plot and before you actually finish your design.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:42:00):**  Things like starting a plant nursery, getting involved with your community, volunteering  
**[0:42:04-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:42:04):**  and things like that, that can set the base to really get running by the time you do start  
**[0:42:09-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:42:09):**  implementing things.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:42:11):**  So there is that balance in between, yeah, don't start any major projects, you're going  
**[0:42:15-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:42:15):**  to learn a lot in that first year.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:42:16):**  And it's going to be essential to informing not only how you're going to start the implementation  
**[0:42:22-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:42:22):**  process of a design, but also the balance of time and the lifestyle that you want to  
**[0:42:28-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:42:28):**  have around it.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:42:30):**  But there's still a lot of active things that you can do, which can advance that observation.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:42:34):**  It's also at the same time, not a matter of like sitting on your porch and just watching  
**[0:42:38-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:42:38):**  the clouds go by.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:42:39):**  Right.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:42:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:42:41):**  And I think that's the reason why people shy away from it, because it often gets framed  
**[0:42:46-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:42:46):**  in that way, like really touch anything and don't interact, you know.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:42:50):**  Whereas observation is very much a contact sport if you're doing it right.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:42:54):**  Exactly.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:42:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:42:56):**  I tell people, like every time it rains, you should be outside walking around, seeing where  
**[0:43:01-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:43:01):**  the rain's going, you know, following the puddles.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:43:03):**  And again, you know, same with the sun.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:43:07):**  And I will say, like, you inspired me with the nursery one after I listened to that podcast.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:43:13):**  I think it was with Akiva.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:43:14):**  Is that right?  
**[0:43:15-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:43:15):**  Yep.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:43:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:43:17):**  I told my wife, I was like, we got to we've got to start a nursery.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:43:19):**  I don't know why.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:43:20):**  That's not like on the list of your one thing.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:43:22):**  So that is on our list now also.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:43:25):**  Yeah, I totally agree.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:43:28):**  There's a lot you can do.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:43:30):**  We also have we call it the farmer mastermind.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:43:33):**  It's just a group of people that gets together once a month that's like everywhere from like  
**[0:43:39-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:43:39):**  aspiring gardeners to like full on market gardeners.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:43:44):**  And we encourage people that like don't have a homestead or don't have a farm come and  
**[0:43:48-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:43:48):**  sit in.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:43:49):**  We go around the room talking about, you know, each farm, what's going on and how can we  
**[0:43:53-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:43:53):**  help but we have a couple of aspiring homesteaders in that group.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:43:58):**  And they're like, man, this is like gold.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:44:01):**  And, you know, I was sitting there like last month thinking, I really wish I would have  
**[0:44:06-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:44:06):**  had this because I mean, the the knowledge that you get from hearing what people are  
**[0:44:11-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:44:11):**  dealing with in real life is just I mean, it's priceless.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:44:15):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:44:16):**  And that goes along with the importance of community.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:44:18):**  Not always is it just the people in your immediate area.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:44:21):**  Sometimes it's finding a way to connect with like minded people who are working with similar  
**[0:44:24-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:44:24):**  problems.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:44:25):**  And that's one of the reasons why I'm so involved with building the community for climate farmers  
**[0:44:29-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:44:29):**  to help people who are making that transition from conventional to regenerative agriculture  
**[0:44:33-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:44:33):**  here in Europe, because there are quite a lot of roadblocks here that I didn't realize  
**[0:44:38-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:44:38):**  until I started to understand the European context a little better.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:44:41):**  But now that I'm here, it's really obvious like, people don't speak the same language  
**[0:44:45-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:44:45):**  within a very short distance.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:44:47):**  Yeah, yeah, that is exchanging ideas and differences and regulations are really kind of bungled  
**[0:44:53-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:44:53):**  up by not having that ease of communication.  
**[0:44:55-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:44:55):**  There are still a lot of things that are advantages here.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:44:58):**  I mean, it's a it's a generally very wealthy area of the world.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:45:02):**  So access to resources is definitely above average.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:45:05):**  But like anywhere else that I've seen around the world, agricultural communities are really  
**[0:45:09-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:45:09):**  suffering.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:45:10):**  Those Yeah, those rural communities have been on the decline for a good hundred years now,  
**[0:45:17-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:45:17):**  where you have, you know, fully abandoned towns and crumbling infrastructure, not nearly  
**[0:45:22-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:45:22):**  as much access to markets and transportation when you get further out.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:45:26):**  It's really important to have support when you're trying out new things, especially in  
**[0:45:30-0:45:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:45:30):**  areas that are not traditionally very open to radical changes or straying away from the  
**[0:45:37-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:45:37):**  way things have been done for a long time.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:45:39):**  Have you noticed that that's one of the challenges for the homesteading communities you work  
**[0:45:44-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:45:44):**  with?  
**[0:45:45-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:45:45):**  It is in a lot of ways we've been kind of we've been toying within the past seven months,  
**[0:45:52-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:45:52):**  we've been messing with kind of this connection of local community connected by technology.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:45:59):**  So we have an online market that we've been doing.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:46:02):**  And it's because of the pandemic, you know, a lot of like, farmers markets shut down.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:46:09):**  But we were able to find like this app that we can basically host a farmers market online,  
**[0:46:15-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:46:15):**  and then anybody can shop it and then come to our farm store and pick up.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:46:21):**  So it's been an interesting, like, kind of getting out to the community and making them  
**[0:46:26-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:46:26):**  aware of this connection to it's like a convenience factor.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:46:31):**  And I think that's part of some of the tough, what has happened with rural is, you know,  
**[0:46:38-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:46:38):**  rural people can't necessarily it's a strange juxtaposition in my mind of, like, there's  
**[0:46:44-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:46:44):**  food deserts out here, right?  
**[0:46:46-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:46:46):**  I mean, like, you think that people growing food would have access to good quality food.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:46:50):**  But generally, it's going into the cities or in getting marked up at ridiculous prices.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:46:55):**  So how creating a market out here for the people growing the food to have access to  
**[0:47:02-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:47:02):**  like, our goal is to replace the grocery store.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:47:04):**  So you should be able to find everything you need within our market for this local community.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:47:10):**  And that so far, we I mean, we've had to connect with farmers like 45 minutes away, and closer,  
**[0:47:18-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:47:18):**  but it's, it's a challenge, like, that a lot of the rural people are not interested or  
**[0:47:25-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:47:25):**  haven't been educated on good quality food, and why it matters, you know, so there's,  
**[0:47:32-0:47:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:47:32):**  yeah, there's a lot of a lot of struggle within the rural community.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:47:37):**  For sure.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:47:38):**  And I guess that's one of the other things with the dichotomy of getting into homesteading  
**[0:47:43-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:47:43):**  that probably contributes to that high failure rate within those first six years is that  
**[0:47:51-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:47:51):**  there's these challenges in rural communities, but then there's often also this lack of understanding  
**[0:47:56-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:47:56):**  about whether or not they're getting full into a business enterprise, or whether it's  
**[0:48:00-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:48:00):**  going to be a hobby that they just do in their spare time and the level of intensity that  
**[0:48:05-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:48:05):**  either of those things require.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:48:08):**  With the homesteading communities that you interact with, is there a tendency towards  
**[0:48:14-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:48:14):**  trying to make all of the income off of the homestead?  
**[0:48:17-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:48:17):**  Or are they juggling off homestead income streams with managing the property itself?  
**[0:48:24-0:48:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:48:24):**  Generally most homesteaders we meet are funding their homestead from an off farm job, off  
**[0:48:32-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:48:32):**  homestead job.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:48:35):**  More and more, again, I feel like it's pandemic related people have started realizing, hey,  
**[0:48:40-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:48:40):**  I really like staying home with my family, you know, and like, how can I market what  
**[0:48:45-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:48:45):**  I have in a way that supports income off of the homestead but what we've run into is like,  
**[0:48:55-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:48:55):**  you said like, it's a business at that point, like you can no longer really call it a homestead,  
**[0:49:01-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:49:01):**  I guess like technically then it becomes a farm, right.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:49:05):**  And so now we need to look at marketing and holistic financial planning and this whole  
**[0:49:10-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:49:10):**  line of like, what are you doing?  
**[0:49:13-0:49:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:49:13):**  It's no longer just a hobby.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:49:17):**  And it's been an interesting journey with people in like that whole, my wife and I kind  
**[0:49:23-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:49:23):**  of nerd out on marketing, like we love it.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:49:25):**  But like, someone will bring like a carton of eggs and be like, hey, can I sell these  
**[0:49:30-0:49:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:49:30):**  at the market?  
**[0:49:31-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:49:31):**  And it's just like in a regular cardboard, smart egg holder with no kind of label or  
**[0:49:36-0:49:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:49:36):**  anything.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:49:37):**  And it's like, you know, there's this whole education factor.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:49:40):**  So the online market that we've been doing is like, that's like a kind of a passion project  
**[0:49:45-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:49:45):**  for us is like this, like, let's get farmers and homesteaders learning how to market and  
**[0:49:51-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:49:51):**  sell their products and, and maybe make some income to where they could cut back their  
**[0:49:57-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:49:57):**  hours or, you know, just supplement some of the cost of the homestead itself, which generally,  
**[0:50:04-0:50:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:50:04):**  I mean, you know, like, running a homestead is expensive.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:50:08):**  So unless you're justifying those expenses as high quality food for your family, which  
**[0:50:14-0:50:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:50:14):**  is kind of like how we do it is like, you know, I raise enough sheep that I don't need  
**[0:50:20-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:50:20):**  to buy lamb from the grocery store.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:50:21):**  I'm building my own, you know, grocery store at my homestead, basically.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:50:27):**  So there is elements of that.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:50:29):**  And then we encourage people to do education also, you know, there's always, everybody  
**[0:50:35-0:50:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:50:35):**  has kind of, especially, you know, there's the 10% expert role, if you know, 10% more  
**[0:50:41-0:50:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:50:41):**  than your audience, you're an expert.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:50:43):**  So you know, like helping people learn something that you know, is is a valuable skill and  
**[0:50:49-0:50:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:50:49):**  worth being paid for.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:50:51):**  So I think a lot of homesteaders don't value their time and themselves enough, and could  
**[0:50:57-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:50:57):**  be making some income that way also.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:51:00):**  For sure.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:51:01):**  There's a huge amount of opportunity here, especially with the online tools that can  
**[0:51:05-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:51:05):**  get a message out and different types of resources out to an audience or demographic that you  
**[0:51:10-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:51:10):**  never had access to just a couple of years ago.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:51:13):**  But of course, there's a learning curve that comes along with that, too.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:51:17):**  How to get a storefront up online, and you know, I'm not an expert in any of these things.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:51:22):**  I look and I'm constantly learning with these as well.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:51:26):**  But so you've been not only homesteading for quite a few years now, over a decade, but  
**[0:51:32-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:51:32):**  also creating a bank of educational resources that, you know, just like you're talking about  
**[0:51:38-0:51:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:51:38):**  can be utilized by other people going through a similar journey.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:51:42):**  How did you start to realize the need and start to fulfill what there is a demand for  
**[0:51:48-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:51:48):**  with the communities you're interacting with?  
**[0:51:51-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:51:51):**  A lot of it was we just kept getting the same questions over and over, especially like early  
**[0:51:56-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:51:56):**  2020, when, you know, grocery stores were empty, people all of a sudden really wanted  
**[0:52:01-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:52:01):**  to know where their food was coming from.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:52:04):**  And we have been developing things prior to that.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:52:06):**  I think before that a lot of it was people are just kind of like, what are those weird  
**[0:52:10-0:52:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:52:10):**  hippies doing, you know?  
**[0:52:11-0:52:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:52:11):**  And then, then it kind of like, you know, people would come out and be like, wow, that's  
**[0:52:15-0:52:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:52:15):**  really neat.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:52:16):**  I could never do that.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:52:18):**  And then all of a sudden, they're like, I probably do need to do that.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:52:20):**  How do I do that?  
**[0:52:21-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:52:21):**  And so we started answering those questions.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:52:26):**  And I found like, typing the same email was like, over and over wasn't as personable as  
**[0:52:32-0:52:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:52:32):**  like, let me just make a video about what I'm doing.  
**[0:52:36-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:52:36):**  And I actually took a challenge on recording a video of content every day for 365 days.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:52:44):**  So I did it.  
**[0:52:47-0:52:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:52:47):**  Every day, I go out there and just something new, something different.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:52:50):**  I mean, it would be, you know, maybe five minutes, but I would record what we were doing.  
**[0:52:54-0:52:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:52:54):**  And then we just kind of started putting that into a library.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:52:57):**  And if people had questions, like, you know, here's a library of different things.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:53:03):**  If it's not in there, let us know and we'll make a video about that.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:53:07):**  Nice.  
**[0:53:08-0:53:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:53:08):**  Yeah, that way it's kind of low pressure, it grows organically.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:53:11):**  And did you have a real objective of creating an educational database or online courses  
**[0:53:17-0:53:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:53:17):**  from the beginning?  
**[0:53:19-0:53:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:53:19):**  Or is that just how some of your offerings emerged as there was a clear desire for them?  
**[0:53:25-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:53:25):**  You know, it really was just kind of like an organic growth.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:53:28):**  It was kind of like, I don't think at first, it wasn't really the idea of selling it, it  
**[0:53:34-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:53:34):**  was more of the idea of just creating it, helping people out.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:53:38):**  And then as it kind of started getting to a larger size, I was like, you know, we should  
**[0:53:43-0:53:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:53:43):**  just charge a little something for people to have access to this.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:53:47):**  And yeah, it just kind of went from there.  
**[0:53:52-0:53:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:53:52):**  Now we kind of more, we have that library, but then we also will do just we call it like  
**[0:53:56-0:53:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:53:56):**  a homestead audit.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:53:57):**  So it's like a 45 minute call where you can talk with my wife and I and we just kind of  
**[0:54:02-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:54:02):**  like, open up the fire hose of like, here's what's going on, you know, so it's, it's a  
**[0:54:08-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/drew-grim-on-designing-for-the-homestead-scale-and-managing-your-time/#t=0:54:08):**  different approach.

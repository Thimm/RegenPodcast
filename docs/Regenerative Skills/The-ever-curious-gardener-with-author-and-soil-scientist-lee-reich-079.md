**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:02:20):**  as volunteer opportunities now at AbundantEdge.com.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:02:23):**  We're looking forward to seeing you here.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:02:26):**  In my focus and passion for designing beautiful, functional and holistic buildings and landscapes,  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:02:31):**  it's easy to get caught up in the macro and forget the micro.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:02:35):**  Or to put it in another way, for as important as the big picture is, the interactions at  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:02:39):**  the ground level and the beauty of the relationships that you can develop with the plants that  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:02:43):**  enrich the earth are certainly not to be forgotten.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:02:47):**  For insight on these relationships, I turn today to Lee Reich, a master gardener who  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:02:52):**  holds a graduate degree in soil science and a doctorate in horticulture and who has written  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:02:56):**  many books on gardening over the years, to talk about his new book, The Ever-Curious  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:03:01):**  Nature, in which he explores the observations he's made from his own experience with his  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:03:05):**  plants and some of the science behind why they behave the way they do.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:03:10):**  In this interview, we talk about soil science and compost, plant propagation, and restoring  
**[0:03:15-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:03:15):**  science to its rightful place in American society and much more.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:03:18):**  Though there's a good bit of science talk in this session, Lee has a remarkable way  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:03:22):**  of making it fun and engaging.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:03:25):**  So now I'll turn things over to Lee.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:03:27):**  Hey Lee, thank you so much for taking the time to be with us here today.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:03:30):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:03:31):**  Good, and thanks for having me here.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:03:32):**  Hey, it's my pleasure.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:03:34):**  Now I just got a chance to read through your book, The Ever-Curious Gardener, using a little  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:03:39):**  natural science for a much better garden, and I really enjoyed it and I would love to  
**[0:03:44-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:03:44):**  ask you a bunch of questions about it.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:03:45):**  So what do you say we just jump right on in?  
**[0:03:47-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:03:47):**  Let's do that.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:03:48):**  All right, so if you could start by telling our listeners a little bit about your background  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:03:52):**  and how you got interested in gardening and then started to pursue it as a career.  
**[0:03:57-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:03:57):**  Okay, it wasn't planned.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:03:59):**  This just sort of happened and I started out, I was, you know, took a somewhat standard  
**[0:04:04-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:04:04):**  route.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:04:05):**  I was in college and studying chemistry and then my plan was to go to graduate school  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:04:11):**  in chemistry and then become a professor of chemistry and I got as far as graduate school.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:04:17):**  Actually, I was studying quantum chemistry and about three semesters into it I was doing  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:04:22):**  really well, but I decided that it was becoming sort of meaningless to me and I thought maybe  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:04:27):**  I should do something more different.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:04:31):**  And to make a long story short, I moved to – I actually dropped out of school, moved  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:04:37):**  to Vermont for a year and basically pondered what I was going to be doing and did a lot  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:04:42):**  of other things, did a lot of hiking and playing pool and also read a lot about gardening.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:04:47):**  And after a year of that, I decided I really wanted to get into gardening and the way I  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:04:52):**  chose to do that was to go back to graduate school and get a graduate degree first in  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:04:57):**  soil science and then I got another graduate degree in horticulture.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:05:02):**  And besides taking classes and studying this, I also became like a mad gardener.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:05:09):**  I would just garden so intensively, that's all I wanted to do.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:05:13):**  And so I really was sort of in heaven because I was learning every day.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:05:19):**  I didn't come from an agricultural background at all, so I didn't know anything at all  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:05:23):**  about gardening and every day I was learning a lot in the classroom and then I'd go home  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:05:28):**  and I'd do my gardening and I did that for a number of years.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:05:34):**  I actually ended up getting a doctorate degree in horticulture, ended up working for the  
**[0:05:39-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:05:39):**  USDA Soil Conservation Service and the USDA Agricultural Research Service and then for  
**[0:05:46-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:05:46):**  Cornell University in Ag Research, all the time gardening quite intensively.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:05:53):**  And then the job at Cornell ended and I decided that it would be nice to be able to just work  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:05:58):**  from home and write about gardening and also do it.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:06:03):**  I could go right outside my back door and just keep doing it very intensively.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:06:08):**  So that's what I did.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:06:10):**  And just the sort of genesis of my property is so I used to have three-quarters of an  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:06:15):**  acre which is very feasible and since I wrote about gardening, this is what most people  
**[0:06:21-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:06:21):**  could do.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:06:22):**  And then I actually bought a couple more acres right adjoining my property to the south and  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:06:28):**  that's when I really went crazy because instead of having to say, you know, one fruit I grow  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:06:33):**  is pawpaws which are a native fruit.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:06:37):**  Not papayas which I know down in the tropics you also call papayas pawpaws.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:06:43):**  But so this is pawpaws but just as an example, so I previously for my three-quarters of an  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:06:47):**  acre I had two pawpaws trees and then I thought well since I have this acreage and since I  
**[0:06:53-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:06:53):**  write about it I should test a whole bunch of different varieties and see how to grow  
**[0:06:56-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:06:56):**  them better.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:06:59):**  So instead of two I planted 20 and then I also grow a hearty kiwi fruit instead of planting  
**[0:07:03-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:07:03):**  two I planted 20.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:07:04):**  So that was crazy and although I'm still doing it many decades later.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:07:10):**  And that's when I decided I can no longer call this a garden and this is what the average  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:07:15):**  normal person is going to do or perhaps should do.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:07:19):**  So I started calling this a farm den which is more than a garden, less than a farm.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:07:24):**  And when I have, I do a lot of workshops here and when I have workshops here the first thing  
**[0:07:29-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:07:29):**  I tell everybody is don't do this at home.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:07:32):**  This is just for demonstration and but hopefully some people do do it at home and they'll be  
**[0:07:38-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:07:38):**  in the same blind as I with tons of trees to take care of.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:07:41):**  But it is a lot of fun, very interesting and I get a lot of really good tasting healthful  
**[0:07:46-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:07:46):**  food.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:07:47):**  So that's how I got here.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:07:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:07:50):**  So I'm curious to know since you went so much deeper than the average gardener by actually  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:07:54):**  getting graduate degrees in soil science and horticulture how much of your formal learning  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:08:00):**  and your experimentation in the garden sort of percentage wise informed the way that you  
**[0:08:05-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:08:05):**  garden and how much you learned.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:08:06):**  Yeah, well I don't know if I could give you a percent but I know that was sort of the  
**[0:08:12-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:08:12):**  genesis for my book because one day I was making compost and I was thinking, you know,  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:08:19):**  I actually, since my first graduate degree was in soil science I really have a deep respect  
**[0:08:24-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:08:24):**  for the soil.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:08:25):**  I really, really take good care of it.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:08:28):**  And so I make a lot of compost which is really good for the soil.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:08:32):**  And so I was making compost and I make it very deliberately and I think I make very  
**[0:08:38-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:08:38):**  good, well it has been tested, the compost and it's been shown to be really good compost.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:08:45):**  So I was thinking when I add stuff to the compost pile really what I'm adding, how I'm  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:08:53):**  adding it, how much moisture I'm adding to it, all these different things that go into  
**[0:08:58-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:08:58):**  making my compost pile really speak to what I learned both academically and from years  
**[0:09:04-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:09:04):**  of experience and from speaking to a lot of other gardeners and scientists.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:09:10):**  And so then I was thinking, well there's a lot of things like that.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:09:12):**  You know, for instance when I'm pruning my fruit trees, you know, I put a lot of thought  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:09:18):**  into it but there's a lot of unconscious things going on too and this really reflects, I don't  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:09:24):**  know, as I said I don't know percentage wise but I think it's a large percentage of what  
**[0:09:29-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:09:29):**  I do speaks to the science that I learned in many different ways because I also read  
**[0:09:37-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:09:37):**  a lot still about gardening and read a lot of research articles.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:09:42):**  And I was thinking that most people if they learned a little of the science that's going  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:09:46):**  on at least, they would have a lot better garden.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:09:49):**  So that was sort of the beginnings of my book just to try and give some basic science of  
**[0:09:53-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:09:53):**  what's going on in the soil or when you're pruning or when fruit are ripening or, you  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:10:00):**  know, all these different aspects and then show how it can be practically applied, you  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:10:06):**  know, right then and there in the garden and then you get better plants.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:10:12):**  It's sort of interesting because, you know, a lot of people garden, they don't read anything  
**[0:10:15-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:10:15):**  about gardening which is fine and they get good gardens or good enough gardens.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:10:22):**  And the thing about gardening is you have millions of years of evolution backing up  
**[0:10:29-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:10:29):**  what plants want to do.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:10:30):**  They basically want to survive and multiply.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:10:32):**  So if you drop a seed into the ground and you don't know anything about it, what's happening,  
**[0:10:37-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:10:37):**  probably the seed will grow.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:10:40):**  So you know, you can get pretty far in gardening without knowing anything which is nice but  
**[0:10:46-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:10:46):**  I just like to push a little further and, you know, learn a little more and make the  
**[0:10:53-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:10:53):**  garden even better.  
**[0:10:54-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:10:54):**  And also one thing that I think is very pertinent is in these times of changing climate or if  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:11:00):**  you even move to a new garden site, you can – knowing more about what's going on can  
**[0:11:06-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:11:06):**  help you adapt your gardening to suit new climate conditions, a new gardening site,  
**[0:11:12-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:11:12):**  new soil, things like that.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:11:15):**  And then the final thing that I – reason I wrote the book is because I think it's very  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:11:18):**  interesting what's going on.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:11:22):**  I absolutely share that sentiment and that's a perfect segue.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:11:25):**  Let's start talking a little bit more about that book.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:11:27):**  So your book, The Ever-Curious Gardener, is really about understanding the way that nature  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:11:32):**  works and how to use natural processes to tinker and experiment to get better results.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:11:38):**  So my question for you is how has your own curiosity helped you to find success in gardening?  
**[0:11:44-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:11:44):**  Well, for instance, you know, I had a pest problem on my blueberries.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:11:51):**  Blueberries are one of my favorite fruits, perhaps my favorite fruit.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:11:55):**  And I've been very successful growing them.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:11:58):**  Every year I get enough to eat all through summer and to freeze and eat all through winter  
**[0:12:04-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:12:04):**  and never had any pest problems or anything.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:12:07):**  And then a new pest moved into the area called spotted wing drosophila and I started speaking  
**[0:12:14-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:12:14):**  to scientists at Cornell about it.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:12:16):**  I started reading about it.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:12:18):**  So now it's sort of interesting because we set up traps to monitor the pest to see  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:12:25):**  when it's coming and then working with Cornell, there's different ways of testing – of  
**[0:12:30-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:12:30):**  not testing, of controlling the pest.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:12:32):**  And once again, everything I do, you know, people sometimes ask, do you garden organically?  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:12:37):**  And I'm sort of speechless when they say it because I really feel like if you're  
**[0:12:41-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:12:41):**  in a garden well, you garden organically automatically.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:12:44):**  So you know, I'm not going to start spraying pesticides on my blueberries because that  
**[0:12:51-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:12:51):**  sort of takes the fun out of eating them and growing them.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:12:54):**  So I started researching and speaking to the scientists at Cornell.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:12:59):**  So now we have these traps that we're helping to test for Cornell that we hang in the blueberry  
**[0:13:06-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:13:06):**  planting and I have to renew it every year with – not every year, every week I spray  
**[0:13:11-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:13:11):**  this bait on it that has fairly low level pesticides, boric acid in the bait and it  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:13:20):**  attracts the insects and last year it was very successful.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:13:24):**  So that's one way I learned to control them, another way just researching it.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:13:28):**  If you harvest the fruit really quickly, you know, as soon as it's ripe and you put it  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:13:33):**  in a refrigerator for two days, it kills the larvae.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:13:37):**  So that's another way and you know, so just researching different ways of controlling  
**[0:13:41-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:13:41):**  this pest and it makes it really interesting and we controlled it.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:13:47):**  So that's good.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:13:48):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:13:49):**  Now let's move back to something that you mentioned earlier with your graduate degree  
**[0:13:53-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:13:53):**  in soil science.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:13:55):**  It leads me to this quote that I've always found extremely useful and I'm probably  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:13:59):**  butchering it and I've honestly forgot the person to credit but it's that a smart farmer  
**[0:14:05-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:14:05):**  grows soil not plants.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:14:08):**  Plants grow themselves.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:14:10):**  And so let's start at the beginning.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:14:12):**  How can you diagnose your soils and improve them effectively with natural and organic  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:14:16):**  methods because I know that this is where pretty much all of the illnesses and issues  
**[0:14:22-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:14:22):**  in a garden originate.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:14:23):**  Right.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:14:24):**  So I agree with the person who said that and I have heard that quote and I also can't  
**[0:14:31-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:14:31):**  remember where it came from.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:14:33):**  But I do think that fundamentally good soil, you know, like house built on a good foundation  
**[0:14:39-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:14:39):**  is important.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:14:41):**  Same with good soil and as I said, since my first learning in agriculture was in soil,  
**[0:14:48-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:14:48):**  gave me a really deep respect for it.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:14:49):**  An editor, a magazine editor was once visiting my garden for some photos for an article and  
**[0:14:55-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:14:55):**  when he saw my compost pile, he said, he jokingly accused me of just having a garden as a vehicle  
**[0:15:02-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:15:02):**  for all the compost because I really like to make compost.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:15:05):**  I mean I have maybe 2, I have maybe 2,500 square feet of vegetable garden which gets  
**[0:15:13-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:15:13):**  most of my compost.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:15:14):**  And I have about, probably let me think, 5, 10, maybe a dozen compost piles that are each  
**[0:15:23-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:15:23):**  more than a cubic yard.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:15:25):**  That's 12 tons of compost, 12 plus tons of compost.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:15:31):**  And it's really nice because I make so much that I really have more than, you know, I  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:15:35):**  have to make sure I use it because compost is a dynamic material and it's always breaking  
**[0:15:40-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:15:40):**  down which is good, except it's good if it's in a garden, not just in a compost pile.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:15:46):**  So it literally will disappear if I don't use it, so I have to keep using it.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:15:50):**  So I do think that soil is the very fundamental to a good garden.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:15:55):**  Although I have to say, I don't totally agree that all problems lie in the soil, you know,  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:16:01):**  any problems that arise lie in the soil because there's a lot of factors.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:16:05):**  There's another thing that I find very interesting about gardening is that it's a biological  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:16:09):**  system with so many things, so many inputs that it's hard to sift out, you know, what's  
**[0:16:15-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:16:15):**  doing what.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:16:16):**  Yeah, how do you narrow it down to just one or two variables?  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:16:19):**  You have to take in so many things into consideration when you're dealing with living systems.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:16:24):**  What's one thing about knowing about what's going on and observing and then making good  
**[0:16:30-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:16:30):**  guesses?  
**[0:16:31-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:16:31):**  But, you know, say if you have a pest problem that arises, you can't always blame it on  
**[0:16:35-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:16:35):**  the soil.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:16:36):**  You know, the environment changed, might be a different humidity, different temperature.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:16:41):**  It might be the pest was never there and just came in and it doesn't have any predators.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:16:46):**  So there's all sorts of things going on.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:16:48):**  I had a pest problem, not to digress, but in my greenhouse, I have a small greenhouse,  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:16:52):**  right, consider it small, 400 square feet.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:16:56):**  And one thing I grow in there, I grow stuff year round in there, so it's slightly heated,  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:17:03):**  marginally heated, so it doesn't freeze, but it doesn't get heated much above freezing.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:17:08):**  So I grow figs in the greenhouse because I'm too far north to grow figs outdoors.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:17:14):**  And I've always grown them very successfully.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:17:17):**  And then about four years ago, I started getting mealybugs on the figs.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:17:24):**  And it was really just sort of taking away my whole crop almost because as the figs start  
**[0:17:31-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:17:31):**  to ripen, I think it just puts more stress on the plants.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:17:34):**  And this is conjecture, it's not 100% true, puts more stress on the plants.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:17:39):**  And then, you know, they start to weaken and then the figs get attacked by the mealybugs  
**[0:17:44-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:17:44):**  also, besides they're attacking the leaves.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:17:47):**  So I was really bummed out.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:17:49):**  And then a couple years ago, or maybe it was last year, I did some research, looked up  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:17:53):**  that there is a fig mealybug and there are predators for that.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:17:58):**  So in my greenhouse, for my greenhouse, I ordered the predators and it was quite successful.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:18:04):**  I ordered them in April and they seemed to do a good job.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:18:07):**  Then I noticed in mid-summer before the figs started ripening, they were starting to build  
**[0:18:13-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:18:13):**  up again.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:18:14):**  So I ordered them again.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:18:15):**  It's sort of funny that the predators were quite expensive.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:18:20):**  It turned out to be $80 for each shipment.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:18:23):**  So it's $160 for four fig trees.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:18:28):**  They were a type of lacewing and a special type of ladybug, Cryptomeria it's called,  
**[0:18:35-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:18:35):**  a special type of ladybug that's really just for the figs, well not only, but it is for  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:18:40):**  fig scale or mealybugs.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:18:44):**  And I figured that I was harvesting at least 160 figs, so it was $160, so it was $1 a fig.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:18:51):**  So I justified in my mind at least that it was still worth it.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:18:55):**  But then I was thinking maybe I could get the insect over winter in the greenhouse.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:19:00):**  So I put fine screening over every entranceway and the roll-up walls.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:19:06):**  And then this spring, I was thinking also, well what's the difference – because I  
**[0:19:10-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:19:10):**  grow figs outdoors in pots also that I bring to my cold basement in winter because figs  
**[0:19:16-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:19:16):**  do like some cold weather.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:19:18):**  And I was thinking what's the difference?  
**[0:19:19-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:19:19):**  Why don't I ever get it outside?  
**[0:19:20-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:19:20):**  But I do get it inside the greenhouse.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:19:22):**  I was thinking maybe it's the environment, maybe it's like more moisture or maybe just  
**[0:19:28-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:19:28):**  spritzing of water on the fig trees would sort of knock them off.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:19:31):**  So then this year, I did not order the beneficial insects but every week, not every week, every  
**[0:19:39-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:19:39):**  day I would give the figs a pretty hard spray of water which would perhaps knock the insects  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:19:45):**  off or perhaps would increase the humidity.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:19:50):**  And or the insects, if they did overwinter, they also like high humidity, not the beneficial  
**[0:19:56-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:19:56):**  insects, not the mealy bugs.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:19:59):**  So there's a good example of this, a lot of things going on and I'm not sure if it's  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:20:04):**  the beneficial insects surviving.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:20:09):**  I'm not sure if they were there anyway and what I'm doing has nothing to do with success.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:20:15):**  The fact is every day almost I look at my figs very carefully and I do not see any mealy  
**[0:20:22-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:20:22):**  bugs on them.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:20:23):**  So I would say thus far it's 100% success and you know I can guess what's doing it but  
**[0:20:30-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:20:30):**  I do not know for sure.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:20:32):**  See what I love most about this and it's really well reflected in your book is a window into  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:20:37):**  your decision making and kind of troubleshooting process within your living systems.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:20:41):**  I can see how you kind of came to the conclusions and narrowed down some of the options that  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:20:46):**  have helped you find success in dealing with issues that have come up.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:20:50):**  So one of the things about soil that I'm really interested these days and that we're doing  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:20:54):**  a lot of experimentation on here at the farm is remineralizing the soil and we're using  
**[0:21:00-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:21:00):**  different types of beneficial bacteria and ferments to try and break it down in order  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:21:04):**  to make it more accessible to the plants at their root system faster than would happen  
**[0:21:09-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:21:09):**  through sort of regular biological processes.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:21:12):**  Is there any recommendations that you can give us or to our listeners on ways that you've  
**[0:21:17-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:21:17):**  found to help remineralize the soil within kind of an accelerated time point?  
**[0:21:24-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:21:24):**  So I guess you're probably not going to like this answer but I think that when it comes  
**[0:21:29-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:21:29):**  to you know soil has always been a great unknown and now people are discovering new things  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:21:34):**  about the soil and I think there's a certain hubris that people have that they think they  
**[0:21:39-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:21:39):**  are doing things.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:21:40):**  You know when people talk about you know I want to make a compost that is more fungal  
**[0:21:44-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:21:44):**  active versus more biologically active.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:21:48):**  You put a soil that's got a lot of say wood material, I mean you put material into a soil  
**[0:21:54-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:21:54):**  that's got a lot of woody type stuff in it so you know presumably this will make it more  
**[0:21:58-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:21:58):**  fungal but you know once the fungi are finished with their work it becomes bacterial.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:22:06):**  And so getting back to your remineralization, I think that except in certain cases soils  
**[0:22:12-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:22:12):**  have plenty of minerals, they have plenty of organisms and the way you increase the  
**[0:22:18-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:22:18):**  organisms is really by giving them food not by, this is my opinion based you know on some  
**[0:22:24-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:22:24):**  knowledge.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:22:27):**  So the way you increase the organisms isn't by seeding the soil with them, it's by feeding  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:22:33):**  them what they like and basically what these organisms like, what they need for energy  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:22:38):**  or carbohydrates which are bulky organic materials.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:22:43):**  So I say that if you like just add a lot of organic matter to your soil and you know compost  
**[0:22:49-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:22:49):**  is one of the best ones, you know this is like 90% of being of good soil care and you  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:22:56):**  don't have to even be a scientist to know that but you know so I'm not a big fan of  
**[0:23:00-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:23:00):**  a special ferments, you know somebody sometime maybe will do a study and see you know somebody  
**[0:23:08-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:23:08):**  makes all these ferments and see what the soil is like a week after that and my guess  
**[0:23:14-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:23:14):**  is that it's not going to have much effect as opposed to you know just adding as I said  
**[0:23:20-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:23:20):**  a lot of bulky organic materials you know which is somewhat easier though it involves  
**[0:23:28-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:23:28):**  more muscle I guess but less you know concocting of materials.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:23:35):**  Yeah for sure it seems like bacterial stimulation is the same around a lot of different practices  
**[0:23:41-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:23:41):**  I know I've been looking into like the health aspect and assisting the health of your microbiome  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:23:48):**  inside of a human body and that's the same thing you have to give it a lot of prebiotic  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:23:52):**  material which is their food source and gives them sort of the nutrition that they need  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:23:57):**  to propagate naturally and in a healthy sort of homeostasis within the rest of the biology  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:24:02):**  in the body.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:24:04):**  Yeah and it goes back to that quote that you were trying to remember about you know you  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:24:09):**  feed the soil you take care of the soil basically you feed the soil and feeding the soil doesn't  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:24:14):**  mean spreading 10 10 10 of course it means you want to feed the organisms in the soil  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:24:19):**  you want to feed them what they need and mostly the thing they need the most is carbon second  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:24:24):**  thing they need the most is nitrogen and then everything else and if you feed them a wide  
**[0:24:29-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:24:29):**  variety of materials you know there's a whole spectrum of nutrients in there and getting  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:24:36):**  back to your soil I guess there are soils that could be deficient in certain minerals  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:24:41):**  I mean the first thing I would do is do a soil test to see if in fact there is a deficiency  
**[0:24:45-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:24:45):**  of certain minerals and if there is you know I would add those materials or add you know  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:24:54):**  materials that have those minerals and one thing I am a big fan of sort of just to you  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:25:00):**  know I don't have a farm so it's not a it's not a farm that I'm trying to make big money  
**[0:25:04-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:25:04):**  from so I can do things that aren't necessarily economical but one thing I do think is just  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:25:10):**  to you know my compost pile gets a whole spectrum of materials added to it you know the more  
**[0:25:16-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:25:16):**  diversity the better in my opinion and just to make sure I sometimes add kelp to my compost  
**[0:25:23-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:25:23):**  pile to my soil because I figure very unscientifically that we all came from the sea so the sea has  
**[0:25:29-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:25:29):**  everything that we need.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:25:30):**  I like that. So let's talk now about the first topic in your book because that's one of the  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:25:36):**  ones that I'm really new to and fascinated by and of course that's plant propagation.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:25:41):**  We've been experimenting a lot with grafting cutting seed savings and cloning here on our  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:25:46):**  farm in Sununna and as we start to plant out our living fences and prepare for planting  
**[0:25:51-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:25:51):**  out the orchard this year could you give us some example by hang on let me say that again  
**[0:26:00-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:26:00):**  you give me some insight in how can someone tell by observing a plant what the best way  
**[0:26:05-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:26:05):**  of propagating it might be and start to breed for better genetic selection.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:26:12):**  Well some plants as far as propagation is basically two broad categories of propagation  
**[0:26:18-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:26:18):**  sexual and asexual. So asexual is cloning sexual is where you you don't cross two plants  
**[0:26:23-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:26:23):**  or they naturally cross or they self-pollinate and they make plants that are different from  
**[0:26:29-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:26:29):**  the mother plant. So if you know of a plant that is really good a certain clone or maybe  
**[0:26:37-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:26:37):**  it's a variety that's available commercially you could just propagate that asexual or by  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:26:45):**  cloning and different cloning methods would be grafting. I do a lot of grafting. I'm sort  
**[0:26:50-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:26:50):**  of addicted to cloning plants. What I do is every year I'm you know I'm just as another  
**[0:26:57-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:26:57):**  example I grow a lot of blackhearts which is awesome one of my favorite fruits and they're  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:27:02):**  very easy to propagate by cloning so and they have to be pruned every year fairly heavily.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:27:08):**  So every year I prune them and I have all these stems and I'm thinking geez I can make  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:27:13):**  each one of these stems into a whole new plant. I know isn't that amazing I get such a kick  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:27:18):**  out of that too. But the thing is I have enough plants but I can't help myself. But then you  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:27:22):**  can sell them or give them to friends. You can't have too many plants. Right once you  
**[0:27:27-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:27:27):**  well actually you can I think but maybe within a space. Yeah but but uh well also also I  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:27:35):**  do find that if I have too too many plants I won't be able to give really really good  
**[0:27:40-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:27:40):**  care to those that I have and I really like to try and keep it down and that's hard to  
**[0:27:46-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:27:46):**  somewhere I could really you know focus on every plant and give it the best possible  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:27:50):**  care you know whether it's pruning whether it's soil treatment or whatever. But uh but  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:27:55):**  so anyway this is the stem so you're right I do propagate a whole bunch of them because  
**[0:28:00-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:28:00):**  I can't help myself because it's you know it's like a disease and uh and then some I  
**[0:28:06-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:28:06):**  give away and some once a year I have a plant sale here and it's sort of like this is this  
**[0:28:12-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:28:12):**  the outlet for my my mania so once a year I have a plant sale for two and a half hours  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:28:17):**  and a whole bunch of people come two and a half hours and clean everything out and then  
**[0:28:21-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:28:21):**  I can start propagating then. But anyway going back to your question so how would you um  
**[0:28:27-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:28:27):**  do that so if you have a plant that you know is a good plant you you could propagate it  
**[0:28:31-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:28:31):**  and as you might guess I'm really uh a big fan of researching things beforehand because  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:28:37):**  a lot of these things have been done by people before and there's no reason to reinvent the  
**[0:28:41-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:28:41):**  wheel so say like where you are uh if you had a really good papaya and um and you wanted  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:28:48):**  more of this papaya you research you know how do you propagate a papaya and I happen  
**[0:28:53-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:28:53):**  to uh grow some tropical plants I know that papaya is not propagated readily by cloning  
**[0:28:59-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:28:59):**  it is propagated by seeds but some plants uh the seeds are fairly homozygous it's called  
**[0:29:05-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:29:05):**  where they'll they'll uh reproduce pretty uh accurately pretty well from seed and papaya  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:29:12):**  is one of those and it's very easy to grow from seed and bears quickly I've actually  
**[0:29:16-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:29:16):**  tried it up this far north and uh so that that's one way to do it and then as far as  
**[0:29:22-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:29:22):**  breathing you could take you know if you had a different plant and you were looking for  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:29:25):**  some characteristic and you say you had two different plants one had some of the characteristics  
**[0:29:30-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:29:30):**  you like but it's lacking some another had other characteristics you could like but lacking  
**[0:29:35-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:29:35):**  them you could cross them and then the the seedlings might have all the good characteristics  
**[0:29:41-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:29:41):**  or they might have all the bad characteristics I have to say I don't do uh I don't really  
**[0:29:46-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:29:46):**  dip into breeding that much I think there's so many good plants that uh mostly I just  
**[0:29:53-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:29:53):**  try and grow them really well and I and also I have to admit that breeding is one area  
**[0:29:58-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:29:58):**  of science that I don't know a lot about fair enough it's one of these things that we're  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:30:02):**  really starting to experiment with as our good friend and neighbor here Shad Goodsy  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:30:07):**  with Atitlan Organics is starting to push forward with this community service project  
**[0:30:12-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:30:12):**  in which we're helping to reforest the valley where we live in while preserving the rare  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:30:17):**  breed of native avocados that grows around here and are absolutely fantastic and what  
**[0:30:22-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:30:22):**  we've done is we've gone around and selected from the native trees that are already growing  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:30:27):**  here and producing really good fruit we're starting to take the cuttings and the scions  
**[0:30:32-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:30:32):**  off of those and graft them on to other root root stock that we then go into mostly what  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:30:40):**  was called coffee tile which is where they grow coffee here in the highlands and it's  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:30:45):**  a great sort of synergistic relationship because the upper story of the avocados can bring  
**[0:30:51-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:30:51):**  a lot of extra economic benefit while shielding the coffee which does much better in the shade  
**[0:30:57-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:30:57):**  anyway and helps to contribute more mulch to the soil with the leaf droppings and all  
**[0:31:04-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:31:04):**  of these sort of synergistic benefits so that's one of the reasons why I've gotten so into  
**[0:31:08-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:31:08):**  propagating plants lately.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:31:10):**  Well that sounds like a great thing and I'm very jealous because avocados, there's a number  
**[0:31:15-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:31:15):**  of tropical fruits that I wish I could grow and avocado is one of them. I actually have  
**[0:31:19-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:31:19):**  grown them. I had some people in the north in cold regions they often plant avocado seeds  
**[0:31:26-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:31:26):**  and get their avocado trees and then they're sort of decorative so I've done that but then  
**[0:31:31-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:31:31):**  I decided I'd really like to try and grow avocados so I've gotten sign wood named varieties  
**[0:31:40-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:31:40):**  and also the nice thing about when you graft, this is one thing that I find very interesting  
**[0:31:46-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:31:46):**  is that if you're looking at your avocado trees and you find a good wild one and then  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:31:52):**  you have something to graft it on, maybe a seedling avocado that you planted or maybe  
**[0:31:57-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:31:57):**  an existing one that you sort of lot back and just top work, that graft will bear much  
**[0:32:04-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:32:04):**  more quickly than if you just planted, took a seed from the plant and had it grow.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:32:11):**  Yeah exactly, it's a great way to accelerate the maturity of the plant so that you start  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:32:16):**  getting a harvest much faster than if you had just started it from seed, right?  
**[0:32:21-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:32:21):**  Right, well not to be a stickler but I always like to have the terms exactly right. It actually  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:32:27):**  does not accelerate the maturity, it accelerates the fruiting because when you take, the whole  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:32:32):**  thing is and I have a little thing in my book about the juvenile versus maturity so if you  
**[0:32:36-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:32:36):**  plant from seed, it has to go, when you first plant it, it's in a vegetative state and then  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:32:43):**  at a certain age, depending on the plant, it could vary, it becomes mature and then  
**[0:32:48-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:32:48):**  it's in a sexual phase and then it can reproduce and flower and fruit and you know, for some  
**[0:32:54-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:32:54):**  plants like a radish plant, this will happen in a month but for an apple tree for instance,  
**[0:32:59-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:32:59):**  this for in the north, you plant the seed and it might just make leaves for 10 years  
**[0:33:05-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:33:05):**  and then it will change and become mature and bear fruit but when you take a stem off  
**[0:33:13-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:33:13):**  a plant that has been bearing fruit that is mature and you graft that, that wood is already  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:33:19):**  mature so that's one reason to bear so quickly because it is mature, it just has to grow  
**[0:33:24-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:33:24):**  a certain amount to get, build up a certain amount of energy and then it fruits but getting  
**[0:33:29-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:33:29):**  back to the avocado that I did graft, I did get flowers on it.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:33:32):**  Oh fantastic.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:33:33):**  But I've never gotten a fruit, yeah but I never got a fruit and I know about pollination  
**[0:33:37-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:33:37):**  and I took care of that too but I had been told.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:33:41):**  There are still some limitations to your place, right?  
**[0:33:43-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:33:43):**  Yeah, exactly but yeah so that's a great thing to be developing good avocados and the other  
**[0:33:50-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:33:50):**  advantage especially from what you're doing of planting them from seed, allow them from  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:33:56):**  seed even though it might take longer to bear or and you can shorten the bearing from seed  
**[0:34:01-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:34:01):**  too if you put it on existing rootstock because it will grow faster and so one advantage of  
**[0:34:07-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:34:07):**  that is you have a lot of genetic diversity there so you know I know that, I know that  
**[0:34:12-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:34:12):**  coffee gets stopped.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:34:13):**  We're going to try and find a balance between those, yeah exactly, like hanging on to the  
**[0:34:17-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:34:17):**  really good genetics of the trees that we know are going to bear really well but every  
**[0:34:21-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:34:21):**  so often propagating a few from seed to make sure that we don't end up with kind of a shallow  
**[0:34:26-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:34:26):**  gene pool that's more susceptible to pests and disease I suppose.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:34:32):**  Right, sounds like a great plan.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:34:34):**  And let me ask you a question, just out of curiosity of these wild avocados what percentage  
**[0:34:40-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:34:40):**  make good tasting and you know reasonably sized and you know with a reasonable amount  
**[0:34:45-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:34:45):**  of flesh in them fruit?  
**[0:34:48-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:34:48):**  Well so it's hard to say exactly because I haven't been working on this project.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:34:52):**  This is mostly being spearheaded by Atitlan Organics and we're offering some support and  
**[0:34:56-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:34:56):**  consultation but having lived here in this valley I can tell you that one of the reasons  
**[0:35:01-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:35:01):**  why we came up with this program is because there's tons of avocado trees already.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:35:08):**  Fortunately this valley isn't too terribly deforested but it continues to be kind of  
**[0:35:13-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:35:13):**  cut down for small milpa which is mostly corn and bean and squash production especially  
**[0:35:20-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:35:20):**  on the steep slopes can cause terrible erosion and we've had you know mudslides blocking  
**[0:35:25-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:35:25):**  roads and things like that and especially in those vulnerable areas we need stuff with  
**[0:35:30-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:35:30):**  deep root systems to prevent us just losing all the topsoil and the avocados that are  
**[0:35:36-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:35:36):**  here are mostly pretty old and a lot of them have kind of stopped fruiting and there haven't  
**[0:35:40-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:35:40):**  been that much replacement as time goes on because a lot of them as they get older just  
**[0:35:47-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:35:47):**  get chopped down for firewood because it's still kind of the main fuel source for a lot  
**[0:35:51-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:35:51):**  of the locals here and we just want to make sure that we don't start to lose this amazing  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:35:56):**  genetic diversity of one of these areas of the world where like avocados are native to  
**[0:36:01-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:36:01):**  here and so they naturally do really well but the ones that have started to be planted  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:36:07):**  are almost all Haas because people can get kind of a better market value for it and it's  
**[0:36:12-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:36:12):**  easier to sell but the trees that are producing really well here are actually tastier much  
**[0:36:20-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:36:20):**  larger and growing without any maintenance than the Haas in comparison which need to  
**[0:36:25-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:36:25):**  be babied a lot and so we really want to try and bring back this genetic diversity and  
**[0:36:31-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:36:31):**  these you know really high performing really high fruit bearing trees that are starting  
**[0:36:36-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:36:36):**  to kind of fall out of fashion because so far there's been less of a market for them  
**[0:36:40-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:36:40):**  yeah I'm surprised there's not some government agency supporting this you know maybe there  
**[0:36:45-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:36:45):**  is we might have to look around a little bit more but we're kind of trying to spearhead  
**[0:36:49-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:36:49):**  it at least for our community first right yeah and planting corn and beans you know  
**[0:36:53-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:36:53):**  telling tropical soils is always like not a great idea to do it you know you obviously  
**[0:36:59-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:36:59):**  might have to do it somewhat but that really degrades the soil quickly yeah definitely  
**[0:37:07-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:37:07):**  exactly now let's switch gears again a little bit here because I really want to get into  
**[0:37:12-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:37:12):**  the nuts and bolts of this book and one of the main things which you're trying to promote  
**[0:37:16-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:37:16):**  which namely your attention to the science behind each of these aspects of gardening  
**[0:37:20-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:37:20):**  in your book is surprisingly fun to read because even the drier information kind of comes paired  
**[0:37:26-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:37:26):**  with interesting anecdotes and stories that made the facts and the data much easier to  
**[0:37:30-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:37:30):**  see the practicality in you seem to have a really wonderful way of seeing the poetry  
**[0:37:35-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:37:35):**  and the magic within the natural world but through a scientific lens so my question is  
**[0:37:41-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:37:41):**  what balance between sort of intuition mysticism and science understanding do you kind of recommend  
**[0:37:48-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:37:48):**  for the average person maybe somebody who doesn't have advanced degrees to sort of inform  
**[0:37:53-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:37:53):**  them in the back in order to find success within plant care wow that's that's a question  
**[0:37:59-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:37:59):**  that can I don't know I guess I could give answers that could rile people up but I'm  
**[0:38:05-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:38:05):**  not gonna try and get anybody to write so so so for as far as intuition you know intuition  
**[0:38:12-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:38:12):**  I think is based on things that you know and and that you sort of put together subconsciously  
**[0:38:20-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:38:20):**  I don't think intuition just comes out of the clear blue and but I think the important  
**[0:38:25-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:38:25):**  thing is you know even if people aren't schooled in all you know in you know very deeply in  
**[0:38:32-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:38:32):**  the science that's going on I think a lot of it has to do with your perspective and  
**[0:38:36-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:38:36):**  how you look at what's going on and one example I think I give somewhere in the book is why  
**[0:38:43-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:38:43):**  not I've had a little epilogue about the scientific method so you know a lot of times people do  
**[0:38:48-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:38:48):**  things in the garden and they and then then they get a result because you know there's  
**[0:38:54-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:38:54):**  also you know gardens are not the same everything else that's one thing also I like about gardening  
**[0:38:58-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:38:58):**  it's it changes somewhat every year so somebody would do something in a garden and then in  
**[0:39:04-0:39:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:39:04):**  their garden very deliberately maybe for a problem and then maybe the problem will go  
**[0:39:11-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:39:11):**  away and they'll say to themselves you know well I guess I guess that's I made the problem  
**[0:39:17-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:39:17):**  go away or you know maybe they'll do something just by intuition and they'll get a result  
**[0:39:23-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:39:23):**  and I think you know people should really take a more objective view of like everything  
**[0:39:28-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:39:28):**  that's going on affecting plants and be very careful I guess not just in gardening a lot  
**[0:39:37-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:39:37):**  of things in life just making cause and effect just because you know X happened and Y happened  
**[0:39:45-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:39:45):**  after that doesn't mean that X caused Y.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:39:48):**  Yeah the difference between correlation and causation.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:39:53):**  Right and this is something that I know I'm always on top of my wife because she does  
**[0:39:58-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:39:58):**  this she doesn't do it that much anymore only because I you know what was it to us some  
**[0:40:04-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:40:04):**  some of them are ducks that I don't know and it wasn't cause and effect necessarily oh  
**[0:40:11-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:40:11):**  I know if I can tell a little story she was saying she was trying to get our she was trying  
**[0:40:16-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:40:16):**  to get our dog to go in the water to swim our dog likes water likes likes to wade in  
**[0:40:20-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:40:20):**  the water and stuff like that and she was saying how she once had a dog that she went  
**[0:40:25-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:40:25):**  and took to the beach then and it had never swam and then she took it into deep water  
**[0:40:30-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:40:30):**  and then it was swimming and how she taught it to swim and I just had a roll in my eyes  
**[0:40:37-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:40:37):**  I said you know the dog was the dog ever in swimmable water and she sort of sheepishly  
**[0:40:44-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:40:44):**  said no before it had never been in swimable water and you know there's different breeds  
**[0:40:50-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:40:50):**  of dogs some and different temperaments of dogs some like to swim some don't so to say  
**[0:40:54-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:40:54):**  for her to say that she taught the dog to swim she sort of laughed after I said that  
**[0:41:00-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:41:00):**  acknowledged what I said but you know so in the garden stuff like that happens all the  
**[0:41:04-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:41:04):**  time I mean I'm sure a ton of it happens within our own experiments here on the farm and it's  
**[0:41:09-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:41:09):**  it's it can be really hard to diagnose whether it was something that you did that caused  
**[0:41:13-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:41:13):**  that change or that was kind of incidental and the change happened on its own you kind  
**[0:41:18-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:41:18):**  of have to go through a couple of seasons and be very uh... observative of what's actually  
**[0:41:22-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:41:22):**  going on in order to try and figure out what the the kind of the key ingredient was that  
**[0:41:27-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:41:27):**  caused the change right and sometimes you know gardening garden is a complex biological  
**[0:41:33-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:41:33):**  system and and you might not be able to you know to to figure out exactly what the cause  
**[0:41:39-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:41:39):**  and effect is and I think the one thing that I'm ready to do at least is just accept that  
**[0:41:45-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:41:45):**  okay so that you know for instance my figs with the mealy bugs I mean I got a great result  
**[0:41:51-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:41:51):**  I did something but other things I know are going on I'm not saying that my spraying the  
**[0:41:57-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:41:57):**  plants every year that does seem like it did cause that you know I hope that I'm going  
**[0:42:03-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:42:03):**  to keep spraying it and perhaps it's not needed but uh you know it happened.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:42:09):**  Yeah I mean we've got a similar story like that here we've been testing a lot of different  
**[0:42:13-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:42:13):**  bio ferments and kind of compost teas lately trying out different recipes and such and  
**[0:42:19-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:42:19):**  we've been having trouble with our kind of green pole beans growing in between the heritage  
**[0:42:24-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:42:24):**  corn in our kind of permaculture milpa system here in the market garden and we've recently  
**[0:42:30-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:42:30):**  sprayed all over our nice compost soil and have seen a lot of these uh bean plants sort  
**[0:42:36-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:42:36):**  of spring back however it also kind of corresponded with the time when we started to get a whole  
**[0:42:41-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:42:41):**  lot more sun and it's hard to say if those additions to the soil were really what caused  
**[0:42:47-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:42:47):**  it to to do better or if it was the increase in sunlight that just you know gave it a little  
**[0:42:52-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:42:52):**  extra boost so we're going to have to keep experimenting over time and try out a couple  
**[0:42:57-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:42:57):**  of different variables like perhaps next season we'll only spray a portion and leave another  
**[0:43:02-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:43:02):**  one alone you know there's a lot of different ways where you can investigate deeper which  
**[0:43:06-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:43:06):**  I'm sure you know.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:43:07):**  Yeah and actually I think I read was reading your blog before we spoke and it mentioned  
**[0:43:13-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:43:13):**  something about your ferments or some article on your website and mentioned something about  
**[0:43:18-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:43:18):**  the ferments and the good results and I was thinking that exact thing I was thinking that  
**[0:43:23-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:43:23):**  you know maybe it was just time or age of plant or as you said it could have been sunlight  
**[0:43:28-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:43:28):**  happening then too and one problem is that a lot of people especially with compost tea  
**[0:43:33-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:43:33):**  I found a lot of people start off believing that this is a good thing so basically they  
**[0:43:41-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:43:41):**  sort of see it they see everything in that light and you know so they start to believe  
**[0:43:46-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:43:46):**  your own placebo effect essentially.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:43:48):**  Right yeah and the problem is so you said you know maybe you wouldn't spray it certain  
**[0:43:55-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:43:55):**  parts of the planting next year which is a good thing that's like the you know sort of  
**[0:43:59-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:43:59):**  a bare minimum you know experiment that might sift out what the cause and effect is but  
**[0:44:06-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:44:06):**  most people if they really believe something they're not ready to not treat all the plants  
**[0:44:12-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:44:12):**  I mean if you think compost tea really is definitely going to benefit all your plants  
**[0:44:17-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:44:17):**  how could you not spray half of them because the other half is going to suffer.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:44:22):**  Right exactly potentially yeah exactly leaving them to not do so well.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:44:25):**  Now you've mentioned to me in the past that you're really passionate about bringing science  
**[0:44:29-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:44:29):**  back to its rightful place in our society and this is one of the things that I would  
**[0:44:33-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:44:33):**  love to hear kind of more of your opinion on where do you see the threats to science  
**[0:44:38-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:44:38):**  or the scientific understanding coming from and how can we do our part to separate myths  
**[0:44:43-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:44:43):**  or bad science from the real deal.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:44:46):**  Yeah well I definitely think that science is threatened now and a lot of it's you know  
**[0:44:49-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:44:49):**  based in politics here in the US at least I don't know how common this is elsewhere  
**[0:44:55-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:44:55):**  of people like distrusting science because you know it's you can't trust a scientist  
**[0:45:01-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:45:01):**  or the government is you know pushing an agenda which isn't science so there's a lot going  
**[0:45:07-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:45:07):**  on and also because people are sort of you know in some ways they get freaked out by  
**[0:45:13-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:45:13):**  science they think it's like beyond them and it's not beyond them anybody can learn  
**[0:45:17-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:45:17):**  a certain amount of science it's just a question of how deep do you want to get and especially  
**[0:45:21-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:45:21):**  if you have that you know that address talking about of just really trying to just be effective  
**[0:45:26-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:45:26):**  whether or not you know science you know whether you know when I guess I tend to doubt almost  
**[0:45:35-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:45:35):**  everything so if I see a sign you know some finding that somebody said and just doesn't  
**[0:45:41-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:45:41):**  ring true from you know my experience and what I've learned academically you know what  
**[0:45:48-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:45:48):**  I'll do is doubt it and then I won't just sit there doubting it I'll actually try and  
**[0:45:53-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:45:53):**  find the original paper that was published just because I have been trained in this and  
**[0:45:57-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:45:57):**  read it and see if there's some something that doesn't ring true and often that happens  
**[0:46:04-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:46:04):**  and so that's one thing I think it's just cultivate an attitude of not necessarily believing  
**[0:46:09-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:46:09):**  everything that's written but not necessarily disbelieving something yeah but not necessarily  
**[0:46:15-0:46:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:46:15):**  disbelieving everything just because it's science I mean I find it interesting that  
**[0:46:19-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:46:19):**  there's certain science that you know people say you know a lot of I give a lot of lectures  
**[0:46:26-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:46:26):**  at organic farming conferences and at organic farming conferences just the people that go  
**[0:46:33-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:46:33):**  to it so generally people like the idea just as an example of compost tea and if you read  
**[0:46:41-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:46:41):**  a lot of the literature on compost tea it's not as beneficial as definitely beneficial  
**[0:46:51-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:46:51):**  as people would think I mean there's a lot of studies that show it has no effect a lot  
**[0:46:56-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:46:56):**  of studies that shows no effect and some studies that show it has a negative effect but people  
**[0:47:01-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:47:01):**  love to love something like that so they embrace it but it's interesting if you want to if  
**[0:47:07-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:47:07):**  you go to the same conference the same people for instance you know people doubt the theory  
**[0:47:13-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:47:13):**  of evolution too some people think the whole world began universe began 6,000 years ago  
**[0:47:20-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:47:20):**  and it's I find it interesting that the same people that would embrace compost tea  
**[0:47:25-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:47:25):**  would doubt would would of course not embrace this other unsubstantiated science so I don't  
**[0:47:35-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:47:35):**  know if that made sense but no I think so objectivity is not something bad I think objectivity  
**[0:47:44-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:47:44):**  and knowing the science I mean it's like you know people when people talk about say not  
**[0:47:53-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:47:53):**  to keep harping on compost tea say the benefit of compost tea I mean to me it's not like  
**[0:47:58-0:48:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:47:58):**  I'm dissing compost tea but you know I make a lot of compost and when I put it on the  
**[0:48:03-0:48:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:48:03):**  ground the rain falls or the irrigation goes on and basically I have compost tea but even  
**[0:48:09-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:48:09):**  more than compost tea going to the soil because I have all the things that are in the compost  
**[0:48:13-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:48:13):**  going to the soil not just what you can leach out by aerating it or not aerating it with  
**[0:48:20-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:48:20):**  water for a while so that's an example of something I'm skeptical about but I actually  
**[0:48:27-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:48:27):**  did do some testing here not as rigorous as I hoped to someday but on compost tea and  
**[0:48:35-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:48:35):**  I did find I had a problem with peas in my garden in the last few years there's some  
**[0:48:41-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:48:41):**  root problem and I think it's a fusarium rot and then I did read that compost tea from  
**[0:48:51-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:48:51):**  reading a lot of research articles on compost tea it seemed like the most benefit would  
**[0:48:55-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:48:55):**  come by using compost tea watered right into the soil which sort of makes sense to me because  
**[0:49:02-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:49:02):**  compost organisms microorganisms if they're going to be beneficial they thrive in dark  
**[0:49:08-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:49:08):**  moist nutrient rich environments whereas you know in the leaf you have the exact opposite  
**[0:49:13-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:49:13):**  conditions so I figured maybe this would work for the fusarium and it didn't have to be  
**[0:49:20-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:49:20):**  aerated compost tea a lot of research showed that you just make a tea and just mix it with  
**[0:49:25-0:49:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:49:25):**  water and then strain it out so I did try that with my peas for the last few years and  
**[0:49:31-0:49:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:49:31):**  I think although I haven't tested it rigorously enough as I said I think there might be a  
**[0:49:38-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:49:38):**  benefit so it's worthy of further investigation.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:49:42):**  Exactly I think it's a process and you know as you mentioned earlier these living systems  
**[0:49:47-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:49:47):**  are dynamic they're constantly shifting there's always new variables being introduced so it  
**[0:49:52-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:49:52):**  makes it quite a difficult task to narrow down things and find real answers but it's  
**[0:49:57-0:50:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:49:57):**  sure a lot of fun and potentially extremely nutritious to do these experiments so there's  
**[0:50:02-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:50:02):**  really no loss.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:50:04):**  Basically you get good food every year anyway.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:50:07):**  Yeah exactly so now before I let you go I know you've written a number of books aside  
**[0:50:12-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:50:12):**  from your most recent one the Ever Curious Gardener which we've talked about today could  
**[0:50:17-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:50:17):**  you tell our listeners where they can find your books for purchase and any other resources  
**[0:50:21-0:50:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:50:21):**  that you'd like to share with us?  
**[0:50:23-0:50:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:50:23):**  First of all they can find them on my usual outlets you know Amazon and those things but  
**[0:50:28-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:50:28):**  you can get them on the website which is at www.leerich.com and that also the website  
**[0:50:39-0:50:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:50:39):**  also has blog posts that I do every week to say what's happening here on the forum and  
**[0:50:47-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:50:47):**  you know talk about sometime soon I'll talk about my fig successes.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:50:50):**  I keep thinking all of a sudden maybe the mealybugs are just waiting somewhere in the  
**[0:50:54-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:50:54):**  wings and they're going to come in just as the figs are ripening.  
**[0:50:57-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:50:57):**  I guess it's always a risk.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:50:59):**  Right right I would have seen them so that's one place to get good information.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:51:03):**  The other place that I really turn to for information is on the web but I think you  
**[0:51:09-0:51:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:51:09):**  have to be as everyone knows now very selective in what you believe that's written on the  
**[0:51:14-0:51:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:51:14):**  internet and I generally do believe some university research sites and so whenever I do a search  
**[0:51:25-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:51:25):**  on the web I put after the search site colon edu and I get a university site or site.gov  
**[0:51:33-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:51:33):**  and then I get a government site.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:51:34):**  I think that's a good starting point for good information not that it's always to be trusted  
**[0:51:40-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:51:40):**  and one example of that is when I started out which was decades ago when I had moved  
**[0:51:44-0:51:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:51:44):**  into agriculture at that time organic gardening was really pooh-poohed.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:51:49):**  I have a textbook from back then which is a great textbook but they have just a very  
**[0:51:54-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:51:54):**  short section organic gardening and basically saying how it's just folly.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:52:00):**  So you take that into account, I learned a lot in my graduate studies and they were not  
**[0:52:09-0:52:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:52:09):**  promoting organic in any way shape or form even when I first started working for Cornell  
**[0:52:14-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:52:14):**  they would pooh-poo organic but you just take that into account.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:52:19):**  So they don't like organic but there's a lot of solid information besides that.  
**[0:52:25-0:52:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:52:25):**  You learn about nitrogen soil.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:52:29):**  Here's different forms of nitrogen soil that doesn't relate to organic or non-organic it's  
**[0:52:34-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:52:34):**  just nitrogen soil.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:52:37):**  You can do with it what you want.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:52:39):**  And when you learn more about how nitrogen is transformed in the soil which is one of  
**[0:52:44-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:52:44):**  my special interests is then it really does relate to organic agriculture as opposed to  
**[0:52:52-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:52:52):**  conventional agriculture.  
**[0:52:54-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:52:54):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:52:55-0:52:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-lee-reich/#t=0:52:55):**  Well hey Lee it was such a pleasure talking to you today I really appreciate the insights

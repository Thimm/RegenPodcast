**[0:00:00-0:00:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:03-0:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:00:03):**  Here we dive deep into the worlds of permaculture, natural building, and regenerative living  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:00:07):**  as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself, for your community,  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:00:12):**  and for this beautiful planet that we all share.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:00:14):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I have a great session for you in this week's  
**[0:00:18-0:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:00:18):**  episode, so let's jump right in!  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:00:30):**  Are you looking for the best resources to help you build a regenerative lifestyle?  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:00:34):**  New Society Publishers has been a leader in sustainable publishing for over 30 years.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:00:39):**  They publish good news and solutions for individuals and organizations seeking to change their  
**[0:00:43-0:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:00:43):**  lives so that they may change the world for the better.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:00:46):**  Their company mandate goes far beyond the single bottom line of profit.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:00:50):**  They care deeply not only about what they publish, but also how they do business.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:00:55):**  They believe in the authors that they take on and the works that they bring to the marketplace.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:00:59):**  From sustainable living to progressive parenting, New Society Publishers has the books you need  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:01:04):**  to help build a better world.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:01:06):**  Buy your print and ebooks online at www.newsociety.com or at fine bookstores near you.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:01:13):**  Okay, good morning and welcome.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:01:16):**  This is a very special episode.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:01:17):**  I'm joined with by two friends of mine, Zach Lokes and Shad Goodsy from Atitlan Organics,  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:01:24):**  and this is a rare opportunity to speak to them both in person because they're both busy  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:01:29):**  fellas and Zach lives in Canada and is just visiting for a short time.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:01:33):**  So we're going to make the most out of their experience and their stories today and talk  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:01:38):**  a little bit about a lot of different topics, but let's start by checking in on how the  
**[0:01:43-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:01:43):**  Permaculture Design Certification course is going.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:01:46):**  Shad, tell me how it's been going for you.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:01:49):**  Yeah, thanks Oliver for having us here.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:01:53):**  It's great to be here with you guys.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:01:55):**  Yeah, so far we're almost a full week into the PDC right now and it's the first time  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:02:03):**  I'm working together with Zach and it's just been great.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:02:08):**  Absolutely we have 16 participants on the course from eight different countries and  
**[0:02:13-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:02:13):**  as always Lake Atitlan and the farm, Atitlan Organics tends to attract like quite a diverse  
**[0:02:21-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:02:21):**  group of people from all over the world.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:02:22):**  So you see a lot of people within the group just sharing their experiences, which is super  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:02:27):**  awesome and I've been sitting in on basically all of Zach's lectures and really just expanding  
**[0:02:32-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:02:32):**  my knowledge base as well.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:02:34):**  He's super talented and it's been a pleasure to listen to you man for sure.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:02:39):**  For me, part of my intention always with these PDCs is to really continue to respect the  
**[0:02:44-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:02:44):**  diversity of permaculture and just try to introduce students to as many different interpretations  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:02:51):**  of the permaculture principles and the practices depending on your climates and your topography  
**[0:02:57-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:02:57):**  and all the other parameters that you're working with in a site.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:03:00):**  So we just had a field trip yesterday just kind of going around the valley and seeing  
**[0:03:04-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:03:04):**  all the awesome stuff that's happening here.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:03:06):**  So just really trying to expose all of ourselves to all the different diverse interpretations  
**[0:03:12-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:03:12):**  of permaculture.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:03:13):**  I mean, sweet.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:03:14):**  What do you think Zach?  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:03:16):**  Yeah, you know, I'd echo a lot of that and thanks again Oliver for having us here this  
**[0:03:21-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:03:21):**  morning.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:03:22):**  Having a nice cup of coffee, sitting around with the sun on our backs and beautiful view.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:03:27):**  Yeah, the course has been going great and we've been covering a lot of topics kind of  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:03:33):**  starting with the basics of just grounding all the students in the natural reality.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:03:38):**  You know, understanding that our world is an atmosphere and a hydrosphere and a lithosphere  
**[0:03:42-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:03:42):**  and that biosphere is right there at the middle of it.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:03:46):**  And really looking into soil is kind of a constant case study throughout the course  
**[0:03:50-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:03:50):**  this week.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:03:51):**  You know, so always referring back to it regardless of where we are in our day and practicing  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:03:57):**  a little bit of, you know, putting on your ecological goggles as I like to say.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:04:02):**  So getting the students to, you know, go through their day when they're not in class and just,  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:04:07):**  you know, observe wind and observe water and observe soil to get a sense of how we can  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:04:13):**  see those connections between them all.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:04:16):**  And I think that everybody's getting a really good feel for it.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:04:19):**  You know, we've gone out for the field trip now after getting, you know, three days of  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:04:23):**  classes and they've been working on some side projects which we're actually going to go  
**[0:04:27-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:04:27):**  down and hear some presentations this morning.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:04:29):**  So looking forward to see how they're interpreting a lot of the knowledge sharing that's been  
**[0:04:32-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:04:32):**  going on.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:04:33):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:04:34):**  I know both of you now just mentioned the field trips that you came off of the other  
**[0:04:39-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:04:39):**  day.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:04:40):**  Now I've been living here for a year and a half and I feel horrible that I haven't made  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:04:44):**  it out to Kishaya and some of these other amazing sites that you guys get to visit on  
**[0:04:48-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:04:48):**  the courses.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:04:49):**  Could each of you tell me a little bit about the places that you went to and the impression  
**[0:04:53-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:04:53):**  that you got because both of them are phenomenal examples of how permaculture is taking root  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:05:00):**  among other communities here in Guatemala and it's not just coming from us.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:05:05):**  What were your impressions, Zach?  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:05:07):**  You know, both sites we went to were incredible.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:05:11):**  Kishaya was just a little slice of paradise.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:05:16):**  It was a valley, very abundant in water resources, very rough land on the sides.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:05:23):**  But really being maximized in so many different ways with the production of watercress and  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:05:30):**  the growth of tilapia and a lot of food forest production and an overstory of their coffee  
**[0:05:36-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:05:36):**  and also just the community dynamic, the story behind that, which is also quite phenomenal.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:05:43):**  But it was really great to see that being held and really the connection to the local  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:05:49):**  traditional culture and practices, but also there's a lot of movement forward with that  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:05:54):**  younger generation bringing the community together to create more profitable avenues  
**[0:06:00-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:06:00):**  for the sale of their products.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:06:02):**  And it's a great site.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:06:04):**  It was incredible.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:06:06):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:06:09):**  Kishaya, which is basically a thousand meters lower in elevation than where we're at here  
**[0:06:15-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:06:15):**  in Lake Atilan.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:06:16):**  So it's a different ecosystem, a different climate, much more tropical, you know, dominant  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:06:22):**  species being like mangoes and cacao and avocados, things like that.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:06:26):**  And yeah, basically everything that Zach said, I've been going to Kishaya for six years now.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:06:31):**  I've probably been there about 50 times.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:06:33):**  And every time I go, I just get some new inspiration, something new to try.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:06:38):**  They're raising snails now and they're use the taro root leaves to feed the snail.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:06:44):**  And naturally they eat the root crop.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:06:46):**  They take the eggs from the snails and feed them to their hens to increase egg production.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:06:51):**  And they're really good at creating cycles and not bringing in outside inputs.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:06:58):**  So they're really good at just doing what they need to do with what they have on site.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:07:03):**  And you never get the feeling that they're lacking something.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:07:09):**  That's what I think is most amazing is like they're, you know, by any maybe developed  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:07:13):**  country standards, they would be considered, you know, in a poverty region, a poor, poor  
**[0:07:19-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:07:19):**  community, but you go in there and all you see is richness and you get this, I get this  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:07:23):**  feeling like I, like they don't, they're not lacking anything.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:07:26):**  They have all the food they want.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:07:27):**  They have natural spring fed swimming pools with clean water and just like, just a beautiful  
**[0:07:33-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:07:33):**  life they built.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:07:34):**  And then, uh, we started that day in the market actually in Santiago and just exploring a  
**[0:07:38-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:07:38):**  local open air market is always awesome.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:07:41):**  And seeing the genetics of the plants, the food crops, uh, meeting the local farmers.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:07:46):**  And then, then we went to the Mesoamerican Institute of Permaculture, uh, and just got  
**[0:07:50-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:07:50):**  to see their project.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:07:51):**  And, you know, I think every student bought some heirloom seeds.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:07:54):**  They have an amazing seed bank.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:07:55):**  So people are spreading these genetics around and you guys think all around, it was a great  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:07:59):**  day, visiting Guatemalan projects on this day, all Guatemalan founded Guatemalan run.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:08:05):**  Um, just seeing, seeing their interpretation of permaculture.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:08:11):**  Yeah that's been my impression, even though I haven't visited these sites directly from  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:08:16):**  hearing the stories that you bring back and that Neil brings back from these courses,  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:08:21):**  the Guatemalan interpretation of what we're trying to promote through permaculture has  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:08:26):**  been something that really far exceeds what we could have brought on our own.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:08:30):**  Like what we've learned from our own countries is definitely valuable and has brought some  
**[0:08:35-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:08:35):**  insights and some learning to certain aspects and contexts here.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:08:39):**  But really the understanding of the local ecology and the cultural knowledge that they  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:08:45):**  put into these projects just completely supersedes anything that we could have helped them set  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:08:49):**  up and it's really inspiring.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:08:52):**  Now, um, Zach and I talked the other day about some of the kind of unique factors that we  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:08:58):**  have here and on our, our two different landscapes.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:09:02):**  Yours obviously is a lot more developed cause you've been up there for what, nearly eight  
**[0:09:06-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:09:06):**  years now?  
**[0:09:07-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:09:07):**  Eight and a half years.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:09:08):**  And so your systems are quite a bit more mature, but we're just slightly down the hill from  
**[0:09:13-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:09:13):**  you.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:09:14):**  And in a very similar ecosystem, perhaps we get a little bit more sun exposure where we  
**[0:09:18-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:09:18):**  are.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:09:19):**  And um, of course there are different microclimates, but the amendments that have to be done to  
**[0:09:24-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:09:24):**  such rocky soil here can be a real challenge.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:09:27):**  Could each of you talk a little bit about some of the things that have been most challenging  
**[0:09:31-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:09:31):**  in your respective farms?  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:09:34):**  Just to kind of work around in order to bring more abundance on the site.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:09:39):**  Yeah, thanks.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:09:43):**  For sure the, the, the land here, I think the best way that I found to describe it is  
**[0:09:47-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:09:47):**  it's just broken.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:09:49):**  It's broken land.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:09:50):**  It's a very little soil.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:09:52):**  It's rocks everywhere.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:09:53):**  There's really no flat spots.  
**[0:09:56-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:09:56):**  I call our farm the chicken tractor graveyard.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:09:59):**  That's the place where chicken tractors go to die.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:10:02):**  Um, I've built probably 20 or so different variations of chicken tractors with, you know,  
**[0:10:08-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:10:08):**  someone's stilts and all different things I could think of.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:10:10):**  And you know, there's not ever enough flat space to even rest a small chicken tractor.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:10:16):**  Um, so growing up in New Jersey, kind of near the coast, these flat sandy soils, it was  
**[0:10:21-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:10:21):**  much more difficult coming here.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:10:23):**  Um, I think, I think we do focus, one of our main, uh, kind of cash crops is, is salad  
**[0:10:31-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:10:31):**  and cooking greens.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:10:32):**  And so we are slowly making these terraces and you know, maybe every 10 square meters  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:10:39):**  of terrace is just hours and hours of labor, of moving rocks and breaking rocks and bringing  
**[0:10:44-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:10:44):**  in compost.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:10:45):**  Uh, so that alone, it just, it's a big time and energy investment just to make a farmable  
**[0:10:52-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:10:52):**  land.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:10:53):**  Uh, I would say also that despite being on the farm for eight years, and this is something  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:10:59):**  I encourage anyone that I work with or teach to, I always say, you know, just, just get  
**[0:11:04-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:11:04):**  the seed in the ground.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:11:06):**  This is my motto.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:11:07):**  Like just, just get the seed in the ground and then you'll learn a lot more than trying  
**[0:11:11-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:11:11):**  to wait for everything to be perfect.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:11:12):**  And I think the flip side of that advice is you do all this stuff at the beginning and  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:11:18):**  then you start to see the patterns of the land and the energy flows.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:11:22):**  And no matter how much you should wait a year before you do anything permanent on the land,  
**[0:11:27-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:11:27):**  that's a really hard principle to, to stick to.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:11:29):**  And so a lot of what I see now, eight years into our farm is really like re gathering,  
**[0:11:36-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:11:36):**  re integrating all my observations from the past eight years and then kind of forcing  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:11:42):**  myself to overcome the hesitation to make big dramatic changes and actually do that  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:11:47):**  change things where I need to take out things that aren't working, input things that can  
**[0:11:53-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:11:53):**  be working better.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:11:54):**  And really I feel in a sense like I'm starting fresh again, which, which is a bit scary,  
**[0:11:58-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:11:58):**  but also really exhilarating.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:12:01):**  Yeah, it's, um, it's been interesting to see just the, the rawness of the land here, the  
**[0:12:07-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:12:07):**  steep slopes, all the rock.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:12:09):**  Um, I definitely have a lot of rock that I deal with on my property as well, but it's  
**[0:12:13-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:12:13):**  concentrated along the ridge.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:12:16):**  Um, my farm has a glacial moraine ridge that goes down the middle, uh, with clay fields  
**[0:12:21-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:12:21):**  on either side.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:12:22):**  Um, so a lot of the process there has been gaining a greater understanding of the different  
**[0:12:27-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:12:27):**  soils that are on the property and how to farm them more appropriately.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:12:33):**  So, uh, focusing on the, the ridge lines, um, I've developed a method of pit and mound  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:12:38):**  orcharding, uh, because there's all these natural depressions.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:12:42):**  So instead of doing the work of, you know, going in there and, um, you know, making contours  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:12:47):**  and and making, um, you know, swales and berms, I'm actually using the natural swales and  
**[0:12:52-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:12:52):**  berms that are occurring within the property.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:12:54):**  I'm planting fruit trees there because the soil is actually very rich there.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:12:59):**  There's a lot of organic matter that has accumulated on the ridge line because it hasn't been farmed  
**[0:13:04-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:13:04):**  as much because the land was so raw.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:13:07):**  So in a way, sometimes I feel like, you know, rocks are almost like this blessing that we  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:13:11):**  have because a lot of the land that's really rocky has actually seen a little less abuse  
**[0:13:15-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:13:15):**  in some senses.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:13:17):**  So um, yeah, so starting on that ridge, you know, farming that more appropriately by doing  
**[0:13:21-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:13:21):**  this pit and mound orchard technique.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:13:23):**  Um, and then, you know, I have this really deep gray clay, um, and that's been a challenge,  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:13:28):**  uh, you know, in a different way because it's so heavy, it compacts so easily, uh, can really  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:13:34):**  easily get waterlogged and then at the same time become completely impermeable to water.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:13:39):**  So then it can actually dry out, you know, just days after a rain.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:13:44):**  It's a, it's, it's quite interesting phenomena.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:13:46):**  So I've been working to create, you know, raised beds that are really high to get as  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:13:50):**  much organic matter in, uh, using a sandwich bedding technique of growing cover crop and  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:13:55):**  letting it self sow and then raising the path material on top and sandwiching that down  
**[0:14:00-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:14:00):**  and then letting cover crop grow.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:14:01):**  So creating space that has like a long term intention towards garden in order to have  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:14:07):**  the slow improvement of that heavy clay.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:14:09):**  Uh, the best soil on the farm is like a, a kind of a clay loam.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:14:15):**  Um, it's got some rocky phases and some stony phases, but, uh, focusing the most of my production  
**[0:14:21-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:14:21):**  there as I've been slowly improving the areas that have a less ideal, uh, agricultural soil.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:14:28):**  So kind of seeing that longterm intention has been a big part of the land improvement  
**[0:14:32-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:14:32):**  on my farm.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:14:33):**  Yeah, I think it's remarkable that a lot of the limiting factors for farming, uh, coming  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:14:40):**  from my perspective of specializing a bit more on the building side, usually the soils  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:14:44):**  that are awful for agriculture are phenomenal for building in some way or another.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:14:49):**  And that's definitely what we've tried to make use of here because basically we're in  
**[0:14:52-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:14:52):**  an earlier stage of what you're trying to, or what you've already accomplished up on  
**[0:14:55-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:14:55):**  your farm shed.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:14:57):**  And that's like sifting a lot of the stones and the rocks out of the soil so that you  
**[0:15:01-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:15:01):**  are left with like the sandy loam that we do have here as much as it's in smaller quantities.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:15:07):**  And in that process, since we have to do it anyway, we're just separating out the gravel  
**[0:15:12-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:15:12):**  or the things that are of like size to use as gravel.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:15:15):**  And when we get to avoid having to import it from down further in the river or anywhere  
**[0:15:19-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:15:19):**  else, really, uh, the bigger rocks we're using to make dry walls for terraces.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:15:25):**  And quite frankly, we've got big enough boulders that we were actually able to completely avoid  
**[0:15:29-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:15:29):**  using any cement in the construction of all of our buildings, including the goat house  
**[0:15:34-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:15:34):**  and the main house.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:15:35):**  So you know, if you've got to go through those processes anyway, like in your case, Zach,  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:15:42):**  with the really heavy clay soils, if I were over there, you know, I'd just be like making  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:15:46):**  adobe bricks or mixing cob out of those things.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:15:49):**  And you know, during that process, you can amend the soil for agriculture with the leftovers  
**[0:15:54-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:15:54):**  and stuff, but all the stuff that you're trying to take out, I always see as opportunities  
**[0:15:57-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:15:57):**  to make building material too.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:16:00):**  So could each of you talk a little bit about some like unforeseen, but creative solutions  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:16:06):**  that you came up with over the time on your farm, just due to observation and you know,  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:16:12):**  possibly some insights that you wouldn't have seen going into it as a designer, but came  
**[0:16:18-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:16:18):**  up as you interacted with those living systems.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:16:21):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:16:24):**  You know, definitely like whenever I think about living systems, I start to think about  
**[0:16:28-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:16:28):**  like the ecosystem services, this idea of maximizing the wind and the water and the  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:16:35):**  earth and the things that the ecosystem does on its own on a piece of property and through  
**[0:16:40-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:16:40):**  observation being able to find creative solutions to how we can harness that power.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:16:47):**  One example I like to give is that on the back of my property, there's a really old  
**[0:16:51-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:16:51):**  heritage maple and oak bush lot area and it's got these beautiful sugar maples.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:16:58):**  They're you know, 150 plus years old, really big, very sweet and I wanted to have more  
**[0:17:04-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:17:04):**  of these growing and be able to spread them into the community.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:17:08):**  I was noticing that because the bush lot is not a dense forest, a more kind of naturalized  
**[0:17:13-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:17:13):**  forest but rather a remnant on the edge of the glacial moraine, that the young germinating  
**[0:17:19-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:17:19):**  sugar maples were not surviving a year.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:17:23):**  So they would grow down in the leaf litter but they wouldn't make it.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:17:26):**  They would burn out or they'd get eaten.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:17:28):**  They weren't surviving.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:17:29):**  It was getting too dry.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:17:32):**  So I started to think about, okay, how can I better cultivate an understory?  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:17:37):**  And I started watching the really prevalent westerly winds and seeing that I had an opportunity  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:17:42):**  to actually create a catchment for these sugar maples downhill.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:17:46):**  So I built a few beds on contour and on the southern bed, I planted some fast growing  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:17:53):**  birch and some currents to create a bit of a shelter because the sugar maple, as we know,  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:17:58):**  doesn't actually like to grow in full sun, especially when it's young.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:18:02):**  So the first bed downhill that was on the southern side was a sun block for the germinating  
**[0:18:09-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:18:09):**  sugar maples.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:18:10):**  And the second bed, I rolled out a small, sorry, a round bale of hay to create a moist  
**[0:18:17-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:18:17):**  environment.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:18:19):**  And in the depressions between these beds, what happened was the wind was blowing the  
**[0:18:23-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:18:23):**  sugar maples down there.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:18:25):**  But whereas before they were sprouting thousands of sugar maples and dying within the year,  
**[0:18:30-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:18:30):**  now what was happening is the sugar maples were getting caught in the hay.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:18:34):**  The water was collecting in the depressions and they were able to grow and flourish even  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:18:40):**  through the dry season and have this protection from the birch and the current to shelter  
**[0:18:45-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:18:45):**  and shade them.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:18:47):**  And over the years, what happened is I now have about 6,000 heritage sugar maples that  
**[0:18:52-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:18:52):**  are growing along a line.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:18:56):**  And it was just that initial investment of bed making and a bale of hay.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:19:00):**  I couldn't have done it any better.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:19:02):**  It would only have cost more money to create any other model than I've done.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:19:06):**  And they're getting big.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:19:08):**  I've got these big clumps now that I'm able to pull out with 16 foot sugar maples at the  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:19:13):**  center and then a handful of 5 foot sugar maples and then a whole bunch of babies underneath.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:19:18):**  So they're like little sugar maple micro ecosystem bombs that I can pull out and drop somewhere  
**[0:19:24-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:19:24):**  else to start that sugar maple layer within any northern food forest design.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:19:33):**  So it's a really great thing that I like to go back to.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:19:37):**  I did say this to the students this week too, just to show that you can find resources all  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:19:42):**  around you like seeing that bush and thinking about using that seed and then you can maximize  
**[0:19:47-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:19:47):**  the services of wind and water in order to create a design that's affordable and effective.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:19:53):**  Yeah, I like that.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:19:57):**  That actually never occurred to me at all like just to create a bed to capture airborne  
**[0:20:02-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:20:02):**  seeds of any sort.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:20:03):**  I really think that's a great great application of kind of like minimum work for maximum return,  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:20:11):**  minimum input for a lot of output and solving a problem that the ecology is throwing at  
**[0:20:16-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:20:16):**  you that these maples weren't germinating.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:20:18):**  This is a great, great example.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:20:21):**  Yeah, for me, you know, loads of stuff just you know, things that come to mind right at  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:20:27):**  the top of my head is just novel combination of plants.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:20:32):**  Just you know, we plant a lot of passion fruits, we have five varieties of passion fruits on  
**[0:20:35-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:20:35):**  the farm.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:20:36):**  And just always looking for living trellises and I think the general approach is you grow  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:20:41):**  passion fruit unlike a tree preferably maybe a non fruiting tree.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:20:46):**  But a lot of times you don't have a tree where you want to plant the passion fruit.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:20:49):**  And there's a plant that I've noticed growing wild in the valley, they call it wild Daga  
**[0:20:54-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:20:54):**  is in the bee balm.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:20:56):**  It looks like a massive bee balm basically spiky flower with these little orange like  
**[0:21:01-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:21:01):**  flower petals coming out of it.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:21:03):**  And what I learned actually is the passion fruits which we generally propagate from cuttings  
**[0:21:08-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:21:08):**  will grow really slowly they'll leaf out but they won't really leap up for a couple months.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:21:14):**  Whereas the wild Daga in a seed will just leap you know in a month or two it'll be a  
**[0:21:19-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:21:19):**  couple of feet tall.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:21:20):**  So I've come I've started basically whenever we plant out a passion fruit cutting, we just  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:21:25):**  throw a few wild Daga seeds there.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:21:28):**  And by the time the passion fruits ready to climb on something the wild dog is already  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:21:31):**  two or three feet tall with a decent enough stem.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:21:34):**  So I use that system just to like get passion fruits up to a trellis or up above a wall  
**[0:21:39-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:21:39):**  something like that.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:21:40):**  So lots of novel combinations of plants.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:21:44):**  Also just for me a big one was just watching my chickens you know like I think I went through  
**[0:21:50-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:21:50):**  I think a lot of people managing animals will will start to really observe the nuanced impacts  
**[0:21:57-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:21:57):**  that animals have on the landscape.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:22:00):**  Just just today actually Oliver and Neil and Jeremy here have our goats so they're taking  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:22:05):**  care of our goats for basically 15 months while we really focus on honing in the production  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:22:10):**  and packaging and marketing of our other products.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:22:14):**  And I was just commenting to Zach before this podcast that over five years the goats really  
**[0:22:19-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:22:19):**  transitioned all the area they grazed from like bushy kind of like brush type material  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:22:27):**  to a beautiful pasture that now you could actually probably put sheep up there or cattle  
**[0:22:31-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:22:31):**  whereas before it wouldn't have supported that that sort of livestock.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:22:34):**  So just watching animals and their their impacts on the land and definitely making loads of  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:22:39):**  mistakes I kept too many chickens on one piece of land for too long and they just destroyed  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:22:45):**  the land and kind of created like a bit of a desert like you know it's prone to erosion  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:22:51):**  and a lot of like soil moving where it shouldn't be moving and very little nutri nutritional  
**[0:22:57-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:22:57):**  feedstock left for the chickens.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:23:00):**  Naturally they eat what they prefer and if you don't give the ground time to rest it  
**[0:23:05-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:23:05):**  never grows back.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:23:06):**  So then eventually they're the only things that are growing there are things that the  
**[0:23:09-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:23:09):**  chickens don't like.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:23:11):**  So even just that idea that that the chicken that animals will shift the composition of  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:23:17):**  plant species on a land has really like wow I never really understood that until I saw  
**[0:23:22-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:23:22):**  it and now that influences all my animal design systems.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:23:28):**  Growing out of that observation I was I was felt called to look for a way to keep my chickens  
**[0:23:34-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:23:34):**  inside.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:23:36):**  There's loads of reasons and situations across the world where chickens might not be able  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:23:40):**  to go outside maybe it's an urban setting where they're not allowed to range or in a  
**[0:23:44-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:23:44):**  suburban setting maybe where all your backyard is already garden and you don't want your  
**[0:23:48-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:23:48):**  chickens to destroy your garden or even somewhere like here in rural Guatemala where chickens  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:23:53):**  outdoors usually give their eggs to the dogs and you don't end up capturing that manure  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:23:57):**  which is a super important resource in a place like this.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:24:01):**  So we've ended up out of all those observations creating our deep bedding chicken house which  
**[0:24:07-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:24:07):**  basically realized that hey instead of moving the animal to a fresh ecosystem instead of  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:24:15):**  moving the chickens to a fresh piece of grass with a chicken tractor or a feather net type  
**[0:24:20-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:24:20):**  thing we actually decided to bring the ecosystem to the animal and so by building a healthy  
**[0:24:26-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:24:26):**  hot compost pile under our chickens it solved a lot of our problems so for me that's a big  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:24:32):**  one is just realizing the actual impacts that animals have on the landscape and I think  
**[0:24:38-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:24:38):**  Oliver will be doing a whole podcast dedicated to animal systems so look out for that because  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:24:44):**  we'll get a lot more details for that as well.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:24:49):**  Fantastic yeah I want to revisit something that you mentioned earlier I know that you've  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:24:53):**  rented your goats out to us for about 15 months and there's a number of benefits for both  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:24:58):**  of us in that case you get to cut down on the maintenance and the chores that are required  
**[0:25:03-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:25:03):**  for kind of one of the more minor enterprises of your farm and we get to bring in basically  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:25:09):**  just world class bio digesters to convert a ton of organic matter into useful soil and  
**[0:25:15-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:25:15):**  compost while we're building up our bed system.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:25:18):**  So I would love to hear from both of you a little bit more about some ways that community  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:25:24):**  has really helped in the development of your enterprises and your landscape management  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:25:29):**  aside from maybe just the obvious of like sharing seeds and advice.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:25:34):**  How has the community come through for you in your development in your education and  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:25:41):**  give me some stories about how it's sort of enriched your experience and help you to move  
**[0:25:45-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:25:45):**  forward faster?  
**[0:25:49-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:25:49):**  Well you know fundamentally you know any successful farm or ecological business is going to need  
**[0:25:56-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:25:56):**  to take into account you know your personal goals your personal skills you know your community  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:26:03):**  what they can offer you what you can offer them and your land and the ecology that exists  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:26:08):**  there so creating that holistic balance between those three parts is going to create a really  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:26:12):**  strong ecological business that will be successful far into the future.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:26:17):**  In my case it's been a really interesting experience going into a community where initially  
**[0:26:24-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:26:24):**  you know I was the first ecological farmer using words like CSA community supported agriculture  
**[0:26:30-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:26:30):**  and bringing a lot of food varieties it's very traditional area in that part of Canada  
**[0:26:36-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:26:36):**  so it was it was a bit of a challenge at first and I had to actually bring a lot of my products  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:26:42):**  into more urban areas to sell even though I really wanted to actually serve the more  
**[0:26:46-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:26:46):**  local community initially so you know it was about you know slowly you know hearing from  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:26:52):**  the community members what they liked you know and understanding that you know you can  
**[0:26:56-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:26:56):**  offer some some strange or different food products in small amounts but then to really  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:27:03):**  listen to what they like a lot of and then grow more of that so you know I started to  
**[0:27:07-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:27:07):**  grow a lot of carrots and I built an alternative root cellar that actually you know in terms  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:27:13):**  of ecosystem services is run on on ice power so you know that actually involved the community  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:27:18):**  too because I'd get friends and other people out and they would help me make ice in the  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:27:22):**  winter to put into the root cellar so getting them involved within the farm holding tree  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:27:27):**  planting days there was a great day one year where we did a tree planting and everybody  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:27:33):**  got to you know plant trees and even you know name the trees after say a grandparent or  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:27:37):**  a loved one or a kid creating a bit of a little like you know community lane way through the  
**[0:27:43-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:27:43):**  farm so having that kind of connection to the community as well and you know creating  
**[0:27:51-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:27:51):**  those opportunities as they came to always have involvement between the community that's  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:27:58):**  around the farm and the community that's within the farm so cultivating community over the  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:28:04):**  years with the people who have worked on the farm and come to learn on the farm and just  
**[0:28:09-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:28:09):**  constantly you know having that learning experience from them as well you know I had one guy Matt  
**[0:28:15-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:28:15):**  who's been working on the farm for about seven years and honestly you know it's been an invaluable  
**[0:28:21-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:28:21):**  experience to have him working on the farm the the kind of constant that he's brought  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:28:28):**  to the farm and his attention for detail has always been really rewarding for me to learn  
**[0:28:33-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:28:33):**  from that because I've had to personally learn to tighten up myself you know coming with  
**[0:28:39-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:28:39):**  a lot of you know ideology to farming initially and and then you know learning to streamline  
**[0:28:45-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:28:45):**  and to keep focused on enterprises so it's been great to have people on the farm that  
**[0:28:51-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:28:51):**  you know expanded on the creative side of the permaculture farming as well as people  
**[0:28:55-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:28:55):**  that helped you know focus down on a clear vision for the farm and just getting some  
**[0:29:00-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:29:00):**  good work done so no matter what community is critical if you don't have people to buy  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:29:06):**  your products you have nothing to sell you know and if you don't have people to work  
**[0:29:11-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:29:11):**  with on a property and to cooperate with they can be a very daunting task so I really recommend  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:29:18):**  that I also think just on a side note that a cooperative farming is a is a great way  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:29:23):**  to go it's often difficult initially to get going there's a lot of decision making and  
**[0:29:28-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:29:28):**  communication that needs to be done but however I'd like to say that like looking back on  
**[0:29:34-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:29:34):**  some some examples of this I know one farm in particular that is just doing phenomenal  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:29:40):**  things now because they've been able to specialize a lot within the farm there's the guy that  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:29:45):**  just knows the tools and the machinery and there's the guy that knows you know the seeds  
**[0:29:50-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:29:50):**  and the crop planning guy there's the there's the gals that are really good in the in the  
**[0:29:56-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:29:56):**  greenhouse work and the marketing and the community networking and now they're able  
**[0:30:01-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:30:01):**  to you know go off from the farm and come back you know so time back into our other  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:30:05):**  discussions about lifestyle you know you can cultivate a really good lifestyle if you can  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:30:09):**  cultivate a farm community so you can be based on the land working hard you know engaging  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:30:14):**  with your environment but still be able to participate in some of those other lifestyle  
**[0:30:19-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:30:19):**  activities that we all want to engage in.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:30:21):**  Marvis, those are some great observations.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:30:24):**  Shad, tell us a little bit about how your interactions with the community here have  
**[0:30:29-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:30:29):**  helped out your enterprises.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:30:31):**  Obviously we're in quite a unique sort of circumstance being part of a very small indigenous  
**[0:30:37-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:30:37):**  Mayan community as well as having access to kind of the gringo community the expat community  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:30:43):**  that's settled around the lake mostly retirees and people who have set up retreat centers  
**[0:30:48-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:30:48):**  and tell me how that's sort of tied into the development of your own farm.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:30:55):**  Yeah for sure so you know it is unique in the sense that Lake Atilan is you know is  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:31:04):**  considered one of the most beautiful lakes on the planet surrounded by volcanoes and  
**[0:31:09-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:31:09):**  just the climate this eternal spring weather is naturally prone to attract a lot of international  
**[0:31:18-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:31:18):**  people people from other places who want to come here to vacation or to settle down but  
**[0:31:24-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:31:24):**  I think so so we have this this clear like distinction between the international people  
**[0:31:31-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:31:31):**  who come to settle here like like ourselves and then the local community that's been here  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:31:37):**  for many hundreds if not thousands of years and so I think that that yeah it is unique  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:31:43):**  but I want to kind of just draw a comparison to I think kind of what you touched on as  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:31:47):**  well as that being the first person using this this new language the first ecological  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:31:52):**  farmer in your area talking about CSA is or possibly the only one talking about permaculture  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:31:57):**  or any of these sorts of things or possibly even things like compost might be foreign  
**[0:32:01-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:32:01):**  to a lot of foreign communities even in a developed country and I think that that if  
**[0:32:07-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:32:07):**  you're considering starting a farming venture and you're listening to this this is something  
**[0:32:11-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:32:11):**  really worth like putting some thought into and having a kind of a solid approach because  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:32:17):**  no matter where you go if you buy land somewhere in a farming community chances are you will  
**[0:32:23-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:32:23):**  be an outsider and you'll be surrounded by people who have been there for generations  
**[0:32:28-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:32:28):**  who who just because you're new you'll be at some sort of disadvantage in a way and  
**[0:32:37-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:32:37):**  so kind of my advice or advice and kind of my experiences that I share that I would just  
**[0:32:42-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:32:42):**  encourage people to understand they're not just applicable if you're moving to another  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:32:45):**  country but even if you're moving just a couple miles down the road but to a more agrarian  
**[0:32:50-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:32:50):**  focused community for me first and foremost is like always be a good neighbor that was  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:32:56):**  like my advice to myself like be a good neighbor and what does that mean it means ask for help  
**[0:33:01-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:33:01):**  when you need it and offer help when it's needed you know and just being able to do  
**[0:33:06-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:33:06):**  that and kind of be willing to say hey I need a hand with something I think that's one thing  
**[0:33:13-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:33:13):**  people may not ever want to ask for help and then you're constantly putting yourself at  
**[0:33:16-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:33:16):**  a disadvantage it might be because you think you just know better than your neighbor who's  
**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:33:20):**  spreading chemicals chances are you may not know better especially about things like localized  
**[0:33:25-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:33:25):**  ecology or things like that or maybe it's because you don't want to be a bother to them  
**[0:33:30-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:33:30):**  but I don't think either of those things are actual turn out to be a legitimate concern  
**[0:33:35-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:33:35):**  people if they're too busy will just politely say no but similarly you know here just to  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:33:41):**  not assume that everyone is needs help like yes this is Guatemala this is a developing  
**[0:33:46-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:33:46):**  country and by a lot of standards say from from a developed country this might look like  
**[0:33:52-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:33:52):**  everyone's poor for example but I think starting with this mentality of we need to help everyone  
**[0:33:57-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:33:57):**  in this valley is actually doing everyone in this valley a big disservice so again I  
**[0:34:03-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:34:03):**  go back to this advice of ask for help when I need it and then offer help when it looks  
**[0:34:10-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:34:10):**  needed and don't just assume that everyone needs help I also like to say that you know  
**[0:34:16-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:34:16):**  whether it's building and natural building or farming versus organic farming and permaculture  
**[0:34:21-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:34:21):**  I think about 60% of the conventional building for example or conventional farming is extremely  
**[0:34:29-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:34:29):**  relevant and applicable and and necessary to understand in a natural building setting  
**[0:34:36-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:34:36):**  or in a permaculture or profitable organic farm setting so you can learn a lot from your  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:34:42):**  neighbor who's who's planting GMO soybean and spraying roundup you know you can still  
**[0:34:46-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:34:46):**  learn a lot and maybe you don't want to dedicate your time to helping him spray roundup but  
**[0:34:52-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:34:52):**  fixing a fence post or something like that going out and helping your neighbor and then  
**[0:34:56-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:34:56):**  also learning to put aside those those ideological differences momentarily and learn something  
**[0:35:04-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:35:04):**  from each of your neighbors and I think that I think that's a big challenge for new farmers  
**[0:35:08-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:35:08):**  like they have this dream I'm gonna make this amazing organic farm and regenerate the landscape  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:35:14):**  all around me and I'm gonna show all my neighbors that they don't need chemicals but it's like  
**[0:35:18-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:35:18):**  hey like okay that's great and keep your vision but also keep your mouth shut when you're  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:35:23):**  around them and learn something because these guys or women have something to teach you  
**[0:35:27-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:35:27):**  for sure so for me kind of to wrap this up in just a few little examples you know even  
**[0:35:34-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:35:34):**  when I had a market garden I had a half acre market garden in New Jersey and I didn't have  
**[0:35:38-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:35:38):**  any tools starting from scratch and even have a hose or a hoe or anything and basically  
**[0:35:43-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:35:43):**  my neighbor who was you know just your traditional farmer you know came over he he disked my  
**[0:35:49-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:35:49):**  field he plowed my field he harrowed my field three passes on a half acre and he charged  
**[0:35:54-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:35:54):**  me 60 bucks you know and it's just like you know that sort of tool like otherwise it'd  
**[0:35:58-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:35:58):**  be at best renting a rototiller from somewhere and spending all my time doing it so sharing  
**[0:36:04-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:36:04):**  tools sharing knowledge sharing like skills we still don't have a chainsaw on our farm  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:36:10):**  I just ask people and hire them for the day and then they're happy that makes their chainsaw  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:36:15):**  pay for itself they get a little bit of work out of it so so sharing tools and and most  
**[0:36:20-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:36:20):**  importantly for me here in Guatemala just valuing and respecting the indigenous knowledge  
**[0:36:26-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:36:26):**  of plants of natural cycles of how to use a machete for example you know I've learned  
**[0:36:32-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:36:32):**  like insane amounts of stuff just about valuing resources resourcefulness about being able  
**[0:36:38-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:36:38):**  to to identify wild plants that might have some unique function in a farm setting so  
**[0:36:45-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:36:45):**  I often say when people move here and settle in as a foreigner say you know the biggest  
**[0:36:50-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:36:50):**  thing foreigners do wrong is they think they know better and you don't know better you  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:36:54):**  know these guys know pretty much everything why don't you learn it and then just tweak  
**[0:36:59-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:36:59):**  it a teeny bit to meet your ideological and personal or business goals and that has worked  
**[0:37:05-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:37:05):**  for me really well.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:37:07):**  Marvis I love so many of the things that you guys brought up I was just trying to recap  
**[0:37:13-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:37:13):**  a little bit including the observation and insights not only of the landscape as we're  
**[0:37:22-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:37:22):**  all taught to do from permaculture courses and the like but the interactions in the community  
**[0:37:28-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:37:28):**  and the resources available to you aside like within the human capital not just the landscape  
**[0:37:33-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:37:33):**  capital is absolutely essential like you said anywhere you go and I love that you pointed  
**[0:37:39-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:37:39):**  out that conventional agriculture conventional building have tons of things of value and  
**[0:37:46-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:37:46):**  that when you transition into permaculture or natural building if you throw out the whole  
**[0:37:52-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:37:52):**  thing because there are parts of it that are broken you lose so much that kind of throw  
**[0:37:57-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:37:57):**  out the baby with the bathwater concept usually what we're trying to accomplish only requires  
**[0:38:03-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:38:03):**  a couple of tweaks and while there are some unenviable aspects of those other practices  
**[0:38:10-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:38:10):**  I know from my experience especially with building having almost eight to 10 years of  
**[0:38:15-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:38:15):**  conventional construction experience was probably the most valuable thing that I learned to  
**[0:38:19-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:38:19):**  become a natural builder and then I took about a year of apprenticeship to learn more natural  
**[0:38:24-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:38:24):**  building techniques and make use of unprocessed local materials but honestly when I've worked  
**[0:38:29-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:38:29):**  with a lot of other natural builders who don't come from a conventional building background  
**[0:38:34-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:38:34):**  their organization skills are horrible their project planning and you know sourcing of  
**[0:38:39-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:38:39):**  materials and design and schematic reading skills are really below par and those are  
**[0:38:48-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:38:48):**  some of the things that have created these successful industries that with only a few  
**[0:38:53-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:38:53):**  tweaks can really be made into something positive and regenerative but the majority of those  
**[0:38:59-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:38:59):**  practices are still incredibly valuable.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:39:02):**  So we got to wrap up here but before we go Zach can you tell us a little bit about how  
**[0:39:07-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:39:07):**  our listeners can get in touch with you follow you on social media?  
**[0:39:12-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:39:12):**  Yeah for sure.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:39:14):**  You can find me on Facebook and Instagram at Zach Lokes Z-A-C-H-L-O-E-K-S and just yeah  
**[0:39:24-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:39:24):**  give a shout out you can reach me by email same name at gmail anyone who's interested  
**[0:39:28-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:39:28):**  in you know some free PDFs I have some infographics on creating edible ecosystems and compost  
**[0:39:37-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:39:37):**  guilds from scratch as well as one on my perma bed system for an integrated pattern efficient  
**[0:39:43-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:39:43):**  food forest design so I'd be happy to help anyone or hear from them who's interested  
**[0:39:48-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:39:48):**  that's been listening to the podcast.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:39:52):**  Marvelous thank you and we'll definitely continue to be in touch I love following your travels  
**[0:39:57-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:39:57):**  and all of your different projects on social media.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:40:00):**  Now Shad can you tell our listeners how they can get in touch with you and possibly even  
**[0:40:04-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:40:04):**  come out here and volunteer and participate in these projects that we're doing.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:40:09):**  Yeah thanks Oliver and thanks Zach.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:40:12):**  Yeah for sure we are at Atitlanorganics.com or Facebook.com backslash Atitlan Organics  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:40:19):**  Instagram as well at Atitlan Organics also a great YouTube channel our mildly famous  
**[0:40:24-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:40:24):**  YouTube channel with over 75 videos super educational but also fun and pretty informal  
**[0:40:30-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:40:30):**  but but really really informative.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:40:34):**  YouTube.com backslash Atitlan Organics.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:40:37):**  Yeah you know Lake Atitlan is a great destination to get away to experience some alternative  
**[0:40:43-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:40:43):**  lifestyle regenerative living.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:40:46):**  We do we have a volunteer program and actually right now or that's in transition as well.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:40:51):**  I would have liked to talk a bit more about the community because I think what you guys  
**[0:40:55-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:40:55):**  would Oliver here and Jeremy and Neil are doing working together on a piece of land  
**[0:41:01-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:41:01):**  is something that I just find so incredibly challenging like the concept of that of like  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:41:07):**  sharing everything amongst three different like autonomous people just seems so overwhelming  
**[0:41:12-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:41:12):**  and and like you said Zach it takes a lot of discussion a lot of talking at the beginning  
**[0:41:17-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:41:17):**  but once things start moving it's actually an incredibly like solid model and it does  
**[0:41:23-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:41:23):**  allow for this lifestyle that trying to do everything on your own doesn't allow for so  
**[0:41:28-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:41:28):**  so maybe we'll get into that a little more later but I'm really really like excited for  
**[0:41:32-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:41:32):**  what you guys are doing here and and just seeing it you know from a different different  
**[0:41:37-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:41:37):**  approach than just like my wife and myself doing it on our own with with like a help  
**[0:41:42-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:41:42):**  of a team and the community you guys are actually a community within one site and that brings  
**[0:41:47-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:41:47):**  a lot of some challenges but a lot of benefits as well so because of that because I think  
**[0:41:52-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:41:52):**  it's such an exciting model and just that you guys are like starting out on the land  
**[0:41:56-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:41:56):**  the way I look at it you know right now the kind of decisions we struggle with on the  
**[0:42:00-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:42:00):**  farm are like kind of more tweaks to details and in a sense it's a bit less exciting to  
**[0:42:06-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:42:06):**  a volunteer maybe then like in a new site kind of like a decision you make will actually  
**[0:42:11-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:42:11):**  impact like the next 10 years for example if you decide to do something one way versus  
**[0:42:16-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:42:16):**  a different way so we've transitioned our volunteer program to now actually have volunteers  
**[0:42:21-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:42:21):**  come and stay at the bamboo guest house but then work at abundant edge on developing this  
**[0:42:27-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:42:27):**  new site and I think that's a really great opportunity for people to see a new homestead  
**[0:42:31-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:42:31):**  small scale profitable little farm slash consulting business really get off the ground and so  
**[0:42:38-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:42:38):**  there's opportunities to get involved as a volunteer you could shoot us a message on  
**[0:42:42-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:42:42):**  any of those platforms I mentioned Facebook Instagram the website also we do courses we  
**[0:42:48-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:42:48):**  always have our intro to permaculture and intro to natural building courses they're  
**[0:42:52-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:42:52):**  usually aligned back to back so you can come for two weeks and get both courses and actually  
**[0:42:57-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:42:57):**  you know talking to both you guys Oliver and Zach you guys have been really kind of saying  
**[0:43:01-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:43:01):**  and I'm seeing this that there's really is a demand to go deeper to get these like deeper  
**[0:43:06-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:43:06):**  knowledge and get a bit more advanced in the course material and I still believe that the  
**[0:43:10-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:43:10):**  intro courses are just a great like doorway into regenerative living but now we're really  
**[0:43:15-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:43:15):**  talking about doing some more advanced stuff so Oliver you have two two week kind of advanced  
**[0:43:20-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:43:20):**  natural building courses planned out for for the coming high season 2018 2019 and I think  
**[0:43:26-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:43:26):**  that's going to be super exciting and I don't know if I mentioned it I should mention it  
**[0:43:30-0:43:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:43:30):**  but there's been talk of how to maybe do natural building PDC like how we could actually get  
**[0:43:36-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:43:36):**  a certification around a natural building course so I think that's in the works and  
**[0:43:39-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:43:39):**  that's going to be super exciting and then also just really hitting it off with you Zach  
**[0:43:44-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:43:44):**  and just I feel like we work really well together and so now we're talking about having this  
**[0:43:48-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:43:48):**  advanced course following up probably towards the end of this year so we have a lot of like  
**[0:43:53-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:43:53):**  the kind of traditional courses we've been offering but also some new things in the work  
**[0:43:58-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-shad-and-zach-l/#t=0:43:58):**  that I think will be really exciting for people who haven't been down here yet and also for

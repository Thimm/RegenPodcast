**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:02:34):**  In keeping with the theme of water regeneration this month, I spoke with Rob Aves, the co-author  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:02:39):**  along with Michelle Aves of their book in the New Society Essentials series called Rainwater  
**[0:02:44-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:02:44):**  Harvesting.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:02:45):**  Now, Rob and Michelle founded Verge Permaculture, an award-winning design consulting and education  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:02:50):**  company in Calgary, Alberta after years of international training in renewable energy  
**[0:02:55-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:02:55):**  and regenerative design.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:02:57):**  Since its founding, Verge has helped more than a thousand students and clients to design  
**[0:03:01-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:03:01):**  and create integrated systems for shelter, energy, water, waste, and food, all while  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:03:07):**  supporting their local economy and regenerating the land.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:03:10):**  Through their design and consulting, they create havens that produce their own energy  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:03:13):**  and food, harvest water, cycle nutrients, and restore the surrounding ecosystems, enabling  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:03:18):**  property owners to thrive no matter what.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:03:22):**  With such a broad range of knowledge, experience, and expertise, we focused mainly on rainwater  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:03:26):**  harvesting techniques and systems in this episode as an entry into the larger concept  
**[0:03:31-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:03:31):**  of watershed regeneration and revival.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:03:33):**  In this session, Rob explains some of the key components of rainwater harvesting systems  
**[0:03:38-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:03:38):**  and the ways that you can treat and filter water for various uses.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:03:41):**  We talk at length about why expensive filters and disinfectants are often unnecessary, even  
**[0:03:46-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:03:46):**  for most potable water uses.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:03:48):**  And the different ways you can keep your stored rainwater clean.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:03:51):**  Rob also speaks about how rainwater harvesting systems fit into a larger system aimed towards  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:03:56):**  water resilience in multiple living contexts from urban to rural applications.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:04:00):**  I've been a fan of Verge Permaculture and all their great work for some time now, and  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:04:05):**  I'm intending to create a larger series of in-depth talks with Rob and Michelle in  
**[0:04:09-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:04:09):**  the future.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:04:10):**  So, if you enjoy this episode and have further questions that you'd like to hear us cover  
**[0:04:14-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:04:14):**  in future talks, then by all means send your questions and feedback to me at info at abundantedge.com  
**[0:04:20-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:04:20):**  or in the comments in the show notes on the website.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:04:22):**  I hope you get as much out of this talk as I did, so I'll turn things over now to Rob.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:04:26):**  Hey Rob, thanks so much for taking the time to be with me today.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:04:29):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:04:30):**  Yeah, yeah man, I'm doing great.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:04:32):**  Thanks for having me on the show.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:04:33):**  Hey, it's my pleasure.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:04:34):**  Look, I've got a ton of questions for you about rainwater harvesting in particular and  
**[0:04:39-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:04:39):**  the book that you recently wrote from New Society Publishers.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:04:41):**  But before I get to all of that, let's start with what inspired you to work on rainwater  
**[0:04:46-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:04:46):**  harvesting systems as a part of a much larger strategy for security, resilience, and regeneration?  
**[0:04:53-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:04:53):**  Yeah, great question.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:04:55):**  Well, I think that it all started off when we started going down the permaculture path  
**[0:05:02-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:05:02):**  and we started recognizing that the world was a lot less black and white than it originally  
**[0:05:09-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:05:09):**  appeared.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:05:10):**  We both cut our teeth in the oil and gas industry as pipeline engineers and we were designing  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:05:17):**  facilities and pipelines to bring natural gas and oil into cities so that humans could  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:05:23):**  operate cars and buildings in the cold climate that is Canada and really North America and  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:05:28):**  the world.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:05:31):**  What we found there was this concept that humans require these resources and this is  
**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:05:41):**  the cultural myth that existed and that there was really no alternative to the way that  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:05:47):**  we are currently operating.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:05:50):**  That was the cultural myth that was going on in Calgary at the time.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:05:53):**  I started to kind of uncover things like peak oil and climate change and even little bits  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:05:59):**  about soil erosion and water depletion and it really got us thinking that if this is  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:06:04):**  the cultural myth and it's true, then we're hooped.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:06:09):**  So luckily I ended up getting a three minute video in my inbox, Greening the Desert, which  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:06:14):**  most permaculturists have seen at this point and called my wife up and said, we need to  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:06:19):**  quit our jobs and travel and learn about this thing called permaculture and learn about  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:06:23):**  renewable energy and see if there are other cultural narratives out there that allow humans  
**[0:06:29-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:06:29):**  to be just as positive as they are negative.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:06:31):**  And so we ended up spending about six months in Australia, three of which I lived on Jeff  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:06:37):**  Lawton's farm and we visited as many different permaculture operations down there as we could  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:06:41):**  find and they were all living on rainwater.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:06:45):**  And so another cultural myth that existed in our society was that rainwater starts as  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:06:50):**  dirty and at best it can be used for toilet flushing and subsurface irrigation, yet so  
**[0:06:56-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:06:56):**  much of the world relies on the annual fall of rainfall in order to survive.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:07:04):**  And so this really got us questioning why we have these cultural myths and narratives  
**[0:07:12-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:07:12):**  around both the energy, the water, the food, and we really started to question everything.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:07:18):**  And that was a bit of a ball of wax because when we came back to Canada, all of a sudden  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:07:23):**  we couldn't just operate in the way that we had been operating because now we knew that  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:07:29):**  there were other ways and that really kind of thrust us onto our current journey.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:07:35):**  Remarkable.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:07:36):**  Now let's start from the beginning and talk about some of the ways that rainwater can  
**[0:07:41-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:07:41):**  be utilized in a home or even in a garden in a residential situation.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:07:47):**  I mean any way that you typically use what you would classify as potable grid-based water  
**[0:07:53-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:07:53):**  can be replaced by rainwater if it's harvested and managed correctly.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:07:59):**  And in a lot of cases, rainwater is a superior resource to grid-based water.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:08:06):**  And we could kind of get into all the reasons why that is, but I mean you can use it for  
**[0:08:11-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:08:11):**  drinking, you can use it for washing your hands, showering, bathing.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:08:19):**  Basically if you're harvesting rainwater, you recognize how dear it is and you're not  
**[0:08:24-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:08:24):**  flushing toilets with it.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:08:27):**  And then within the garden, any kind of irrigation works that you might have absolutely benefits  
**[0:08:32-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:08:32):**  from rainwater.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:08:34):**  The advantages of irrigating with rainwater is that it's very light on the mineral side  
**[0:08:39-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:08:39):**  of things.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:08:40):**  And so you're not going to plug up irrigation points with it like drip irrigators.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:08:47):**  You're not going to salt the soils.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:08:50):**  And especially in the Northern hemisphere, this is kind of an unknown fact, but 50% of  
**[0:08:54-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:08:54):**  our nitrogen comes in the form of rainwater through this really interesting interaction  
**[0:09:00-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:09:00):**  with lightning.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:09:01):**  So as lightning interacts with air and rain follows, it actually changes the chemical  
**[0:09:09-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:09:09):**  composition or the compound, the nitrogen compound in the air to be a soluble nitrate.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:09:15):**  And then the rainwater will pick it up and bring it down to the ground.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:09:18):**  So rainwater actually ends up being a fertilizer as well as this wonderful hydration element.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:09:27):**  All right.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:09:28):**  So in your professional opinion, now you alluded to this a second ago, is it usually necessary  
**[0:09:33-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:09:33):**  to install a disinfection and sterilization equipment in a rainwater harvesting or storage  
**[0:09:39-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:09:39):**  system?  
**[0:09:40-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:09:40):**  So what I'll say is that depending on where your jurisdiction is will depend on what your  
**[0:09:47-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:09:47):**  codes require you to do.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:09:50):**  And every jurisdiction is going to have a different take on what is and is not required.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:09:58):**  The other thing that I'm going to say to you though, is that currently, and for the last  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:10:02):**  hundred plus years in Australia, over 3 million Australians drink rainwater without any end  
**[0:10:07-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:10:07):**  of line treatment.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:10:10):**  And the research that we uncovered as a result of writing the book that we're talking about  
**[0:10:15-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:10:15):**  right now showed that there are even slight statistical significant observations that  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:10:23):**  showed that children that drank rainwater are actually marginally healthier than children  
**[0:10:29-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:10:29):**  that drank chlorinated grid-based water.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:10:32):**  So yes, as an engineer, you have to be careful about telling people that they have to  
**[0:10:40-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:10:40):**  follow the code.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:10:42):**  However, we have a huge epidemiological case study that we can draw from, which is Australia  
**[0:10:50-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:10:50):**  and even places like where you're calling in from today, where people are drinking rainwater  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:10:56):**  successfully without end, we'll call it end of line treatment.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:11:00):**  Now the other important thing to notice or recognize or acknowledge is that just because  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:11:06):**  you don't have a UV filter or a particulate filter or a carbon filter on the back end  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:11:11):**  of a rainwater system, it doesn't mean that there is not filtration and water quality  
**[0:11:17-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:11:17):**  improvement mechanisms occurring within a rainwater harvesting system, which I'll refer  
**[0:11:24-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:11:24):**  to as a treatment train.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:11:25):**  Okay, well let's explore that a little bit.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:11:27):**  Walk me through some of the options from the point of contact where rain first enters until  
**[0:11:32-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:11:32):**  the end point of use, that a rainwater harvesting system can clean the water without using expensive  
**[0:11:39-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:11:39):**  filters or disinfectant appliance.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:11:41):**  So as part of this, I'll send you over an infographic that you can link in your show  
**[0:11:48-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:11:48):**  notes which kind of has a visual representation of this treatment train.  
**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:11:54):**  But I mean the treatment train really starts right from the roof and so a properly designed  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:12:00):**  collection system is going to make sure that there's not a lot of vegetation hanging over  
**[0:12:05-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:12:05):**  top of it, that the roof is clean and that it's generally going to be an impervious surface  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:12:13):**  which most roofs are, but not like an impervious surface without a lot of roughness essentially.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:12:18):**  So water is free to flow over top of the roof and the roof doesn't accumulate massive amounts  
**[0:12:23-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:12:23):**  of sediment or dirt on it.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:12:25):**  The water then flows through properly sloped gutters and in a lot of the books that ironically  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:12:31):**  they talk about the importance of keeping gutters clean, but some of the research has  
**[0:12:35-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:12:35):**  actually shown that gutters that have debris in them actually produce better rainwater  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:12:41):**  because there's a biological cleaning mechanism going on in those gutters.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:12:45):**  Now my recommendation is still to keep those gutters clean because we want efficient and  
**[0:12:49-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:12:49):**  effective conveyance.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:12:51):**  We don't want the water overflowing the gutters because we want to collect the resource.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:12:54):**  So we can find other ways to enhance those biological functions which we're going to  
**[0:13:01-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:13:01):**  talk about here shortly.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:13:03):**  So the water moves through those gutters.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:13:05):**  Now there's all sorts of products out there that put these screens on top of gutters to  
**[0:13:11-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:13:11):**  try and keep the debris out of the gutter itself and reduce maintenance and it turns  
**[0:13:17-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:13:17):**  out that those are not really great solutions.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:13:20):**  One of the most important components in an effective treatment train and collection system  
**[0:13:26-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:13:26):**  is actually UV light.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:13:28):**  We want our roofs to have access to UV light.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:13:31):**  We want our gutters to have access to UV light.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:13:33):**  UV is the ultimate disinfectant and when we put these screens over top of gutters we end  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:13:41):**  up removing that UV component from our gutters.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:13:46):**  The other interesting thing that happens is that one of my contractors that I use up here,  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:13:51):**  he's an exterior specialist, has removed more of these systems than he's put in because  
**[0:13:56-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:13:56):**  he says it moves the problem four inches up.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:13:59):**  So you end up getting this beautiful collection surface for organics which can actually compromise  
**[0:14:09-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:14:09):**  the sheathing layer underneath the roof and causing all sorts of dry rot.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:14:12):**  Yeah, I can imagine.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:14:14):**  We actually want to keep things transparent and open to the sun up there.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:14:20):**  So then once we collect it we want to make sure that the water is then coming down a  
**[0:14:24-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:14:24):**  downspout.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:14:25):**  The downspout's typically vertical.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:14:28):**  If it's not then it'll be at an angle so we got to make sure we have the right slopes  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:14:34):**  and things on there to make sure that we have good conveyance.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:14:37):**  And then we want to send all the water through something called a rain head or an inline  
**[0:14:43-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:14:43):**  filter and this is a fine meshed filter.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:14:46):**  Typically it's got a 45 degree angle on the mesh itself and so any debris that collects  
**[0:14:52-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:14:52):**  on that filter is going to be automatically cleaned off and I can send you a link to what  
**[0:15:00-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:15:00):**  one of these filters looks like so you can put it in the show notes.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:15:03):**  There's a bunch of products that come right out of Australia that kind of perfected this  
**[0:15:07-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:15:07):**  technology and they're very inexpensive.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:15:09):**  They're about $50-$60 and they fit right into your water harvesting system.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:15:17):**  Now a lot of people in the rainwater sphere talk about the importance of first flush diverters  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:15:23):**  and it turns out that they're really not as important as everybody makes them out to be.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:15:28):**  If you're going to use one there's a lot of controversy around how many litres or gallons  
**[0:15:33-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:15:33):**  you should be diverting from your stream.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:15:36):**  And basically for folks who have never heard of this, a first flush diverter basically  
**[0:15:39-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:15:39):**  takes the first flush off the roof and basically diverts it away from the tank before it goes  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:15:48):**  into the tank with the idea that this first flush is going to have the most debris in  
**[0:15:52-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:15:52):**  the water.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:15:54):**  And we'll talk about why it's not really all that important but more often than not I see  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:15:58):**  first flush diverters that are not maintained and so they get filled with debris, they plug  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:16:03):**  off and they go septic and so they can end up kind of being more detrimental to the system  
**[0:16:09-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:16:09):**  than positive.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:16:11):**  But if you're going to use one the rule of thumb is generally around 10-20 litres is  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:16:15):**  the first amount of volume that you want to divert.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:16:20):**  Anything more than that and you get massive diminishing results.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:16:23):**  So you want to make sure that if you're going to put one in that you're doing maintenance  
**[0:16:25-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:16:25):**  on a regular basis and cleaning the system out and making sure that it's functioning.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:16:29):**  If you're not the type of guy or person to want to do that kind of maintenance then just  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:16:34):**  avoid it altogether and you can save the cost of that first flush diverter.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:16:38):**  The water then goes into the tank and we send it into the tank into a pipe that depowers  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:16:46):**  the flow of water and we call this the quiet inlet.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:16:50):**  And we're doing this because we want to make sure that when the water goes into the tank  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:16:54):**  that it's not stirring up all sorts of sediment, that it's literally quietly being introduced  
**[0:17:00-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:17:00):**  into the existing water column.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:17:03):**  Now there's a couple of reasons for this.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:17:05):**  It turns out, and the Romans, I'll just back up a second, the Romans were able to observe  
**[0:17:11-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:17:11):**  that water when stored in storages, tanks, for long periods of time would improve in  
**[0:17:18-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:17:18):**  quality.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:17:20):**  They were able to observe that but they weren't able to understand what was actually or what  
**[0:17:24-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:17:24):**  the mechanism of that quality improvement actually was.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:17:27):**  We now have the science to understand that mechanism which is incredible.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:17:33):**  This is probably the biggest insight from writing the book was being able to dig into  
**[0:17:36-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:17:36):**  this research because we had observed it as well in Australia but no one could really  
**[0:17:43-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:17:43):**  tell us what the scientific mechanism actually or mechanisms actually was.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:17:51):**  This is one of the reasons that a well-designed system is so effective at filtering water.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:17:56):**  So number one, in a large rain tank where you have slow movement of water and long periods  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:18:03):**  of time where that water is kind of sitting in that tank, you get sedimentation.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:18:08):**  That sedimentation is going to form a sludge layer over time.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:18:11):**  Now rainwater itself is actually very low in nutrient and there are microbes that are  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:18:18):**  picked up through the process of raining, through running over the roof and through  
**[0:18:22-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:18:22):**  the gutter and through the pipes.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:18:25):**  And so all those microbes that are in the water are super hungry because there's not  
**[0:18:28-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:18:28):**  a lot of food available.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:18:31):**  And so these microbes will end up, some of them will get dropped out in the sediment  
**[0:18:37-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:18:37):**  and that sludge layer in the bottom.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:18:40):**  And so as water slowly moves across that sludge layer and as that sediment drops out, those  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:18:45):**  microbes are super, super hungry and they will grab onto anything that they can.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:18:50):**  And so when scientists in Australia did independent research and studies on this sludge layer,  
**[0:18:55-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:18:55):**  they found that when they looked at heavy metal concentrations as one example, that  
**[0:19:02-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:19:02):**  there were concentrations as high as 350,000 times that of the center water column in that  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:19:09):**  sludge layer, which was a very strong indication that the sludge layer was actually acting  
**[0:19:14-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:19:14):**  as a bioremediation mechanism.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:19:16):**  And they tested a whole suite of heavy metals.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:19:18):**  They tested pathogens, bugs, microbes.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:19:21):**  And so it turns out that these sludge layers are actually held together with polysaccharides,  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:19:27):**  which are essentially just complex sugars that are exuded by the microbes themselves.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:19:31):**  And those polysaccharides create this matrix that actually pulls and bioremediates that  
**[0:19:37-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:19:37):**  water.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:19:38):**  And the same mechanisms are actually going on on the sides of the tanks as well where  
**[0:19:40-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:19:40):**  the biofilms are forming.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:19:42):**  And so the tank itself is one of the most effective mechanisms for cleaning this rainwater.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:19:49):**  And you can see massive improvements in rainwater in as little as two weeks.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:19:54):**  So large storages create very effective bioremediation mechanisms themselves.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:19:59):**  And I'll just quickly go through the other two mechanisms.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:20:03):**  There's a series of other ones there, but the two main ones are going to be when you  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:20:08):**  take water from that tank and you pressurize it, that instantaneous increase in pressure  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:20:13):**  is going to destroy life, destroy some of the negative life.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:20:18):**  And then if you're running water into a hot water tank, there's actually a process called  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:20:22):**  tindalization, which moves water from one temperature to another temperature really  
**[0:20:26-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:20:26):**  rapidly.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:20:28):**  And so what goes on there is that as you have this aqueous solution, the rainwater tank  
**[0:20:33-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:20:33):**  itself, things like spores and microbes are in a non dormant stage because they're in  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:20:40):**  an environment where they can kind of express themselves and be alive as opposed to being  
**[0:20:44-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:20:44):**  dry and dormant.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:20:46):**  And so when you take a live organism like a spore and you change its pressure and then  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:20:51):**  you change its temperature really quickly, you end up destroying it.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:20:56):**  And so all throughout this system, there are little mechanisms that improve the water from  
**[0:21:04-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:21:04):**  source, sorry, from the rain cloud basically right to the faucet.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:21:10):**  And so those are the primary mechanisms that we see in the treatment train essentially.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:21:19):**  All that is fascinating and I can't help from a natural building perspective, wonder if  
**[0:21:24-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:21:24):**  you have any recommendations or observations on what type of roof you're using to catch  
**[0:21:29-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:21:29):**  the rainwater and how that might affect the water quality itself.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:21:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:21:34):**  So I mean from a natural building perspective, I don't know how much research is being done  
**[0:21:39-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:21:39):**  on thatched roofs and things like that, but generally speaking, we talk about materials  
**[0:21:48-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:21:48):**  that have fairly low roughness surfaces.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:21:55):**  So metal roofs are great.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:21:58):**  They do have a lot of embodied energy in them because they're metal, but they're fully recyclable  
**[0:22:03-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:22:03):**  and they last for really long periods of time.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:22:04):**  So we generally tend to recommend those and I'm a really big fan of standing seam roofs  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:22:10):**  because the fasteners are not exposed.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:22:15):**  But I suspect clay roofs, in fact, I've read research on clay roofs and they can be like  
**[0:22:19-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:22:19):**  clay tiles can be really effective as well.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:22:25):**  Generally speaking, we want to avoid natural materials like cedar shakes.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:22:29):**  And so I suspect that thatched roofs would be similar to that.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:22:34):**  Cedar for sure can leach tannins and generally introduce all sorts of additional things that  
**[0:22:40-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:22:40):**  we're trying to avoid.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:22:41):**  I mean, we really want to keep the nutrient load inside of our rain tank low so that we  
**[0:22:46-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:22:46):**  can get those microbes working in our favor.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:22:50):**  We don't want to create or collect a soup of nutrients in that tank.  
**[0:22:56-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:22:56):**  It's one of the mechanisms that's occurring there.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:22:58):**  I'm trying to remember the scientific name for it, but the microbial exclusion, I think  
**[0:23:06-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:23:06):**  is what it's called.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:23:07):**  So because the microbes are hungry, they really work hard for us.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:23:11):**  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense and that supports what I've heard around in the natural building  
**[0:23:15-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:23:15):**  community for as many benefits as natural material roofs have.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:23:21):**  For one thing, I've never seen a gutter system on a thatched roof and the preservatives that  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:23:26):**  are naturally in cedar shakes in particular can have a toxic effect on water if you end  
**[0:23:31-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:23:31):**  up storing it.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:23:33):**  And I've really only had the most success from corrugated metal or other type of laminates.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:23:39):**  And I've also heard that asphalt tiles or asphalt shingles can also leach petroleum  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:23:44):**  into your water storage tank over time.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:23:47):**  Yeah, ironically you can actually collect rainwater off of asphalt shingles.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:23:52):**  I think the big issue that you got to look for there are what they impregnate the asphalt  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:23:57):**  with itself.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:23:58):**  It's funny, asphalt itself is kind of a natural material, which is kind of a strange thing  
**[0:24:04-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:24:04):**  to say.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:24:05):**  It's the fungicides and the biocides that they put into it that can be problematic.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:24:10):**  The other big issue with asphalt is again, it's a rough surface and so it's going to  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:24:16):**  accumulate more debris than a smooth surface.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:24:21):**  And then of course there are other problems with asphalt.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:24:24):**  I mean, at best you're going to get a 10 to 30 year life cycle on that thing before you're  
**[0:24:30-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:24:30):**  creating an enormous amount of waste and then you've got to replace it versus a metal roof  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:24:34):**  is really there for the life of the building as long as it's maintained properly.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:24:38):**  And I mean, there's going to be some exceptions to that, but yeah, I mean, metal is the best  
**[0:24:44-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:24:44):**  I think.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:24:45):**  Yeah, I'm in favor of it too.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:24:46):**  It may not be an entirely natural material, but with its infinite recyclability, I think  
**[0:24:52-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:24:52):**  it makes up for it in a lot of other ways.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:24:54):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:24:55):**  Let's talk a little bit about the maintenance on a system like this.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:24:58):**  Do rainwater harvesting systems require quite a bit of attention or is there a pretty big  
**[0:25:03-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:25:03):**  spectrum on the maintenance cycle depending on the system that you install?  
**[0:25:07-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:25:07):**  A lot less than you probably think.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:25:09):**  So a properly sited and designed system needs to be inspected.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:25:12):**  You should be going up and inspecting gutters and your roof and stick your head into the  
**[0:25:17-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:25:17):**  tank.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:25:18):**  So there's a very interesting misconception about actually getting into tanks and de-sludging  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:25:24):**  and cleaning biofilms and things like that off of the walls.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:25:29):**  Ironically, when you add mains water, so chlorinated or sterilized water that's sterilized with  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:25:37):**  some sort of a sterilant in it, you end up killing or damaging the biofilms and the sludge  
**[0:25:42-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:25:42):**  layer which detrimentally affects the quality of the tank.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:25:45):**  So we actually want to leave it alone.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:25:47):**  We like, it's kind of a bit of a loner and it doesn't really want to be messed around  
**[0:25:53-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:25:53):**  with because doing that will affect its ability to do what it does really best.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:26:01):**  So we want to look in there, make sure there's no dead animals or anything like that inside  
**[0:26:06-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:26:06):**  the tank or any other kind of things that could potentially knock off the ecosystem.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:26:14):**  And so inspecting it once or twice a year is probably a good idea.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:26:19):**  Making sure all the pipes are functioning and not cracked or anything like that.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:26:24):**  And then if you are going to put any kind of end of line treatment, which you can do,  
**[0:26:28-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:26:28):**  there are some very simple filters that can make a difference and improve the overall  
**[0:26:34-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:26:34):**  water quality.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:26:36):**  Those would be other mechanisms or components of the system that you'd want to change on  
**[0:26:42-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:26:42):**  a semi-regular basis.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:26:43):**  And so those filters would typically be something like a carbon filter if you want to be sure  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:26:49):**  there's no SOCs or VOCs in the water, if you've got that kind of a load around you, which  
**[0:26:54-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:26:54):**  let's be honest everywhere on the planet has that floating around in the air now.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:27:00):**  And potentially a particulate filter as well, which would typically, you typically have  
**[0:27:05-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:27:05):**  a particulate filter before the pump, which wouldn't be super granular, but enough to  
**[0:27:11-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:27:11):**  protect the pump itself, the impeller.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:27:14):**  And then you might have a finer filter before it goes to your tap.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:27:19):**  And so, you know, a 0.5 micron filter would kind of be something that we'd recommend.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:27:27):**  And you might have a pre-filter in front of that 0.5 micron filter.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:27:30):**  So just to kind of go through the train, you have a pre-filter for the pump.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:27:34):**  Then you'd have a spun filter, like a 25 to 5 micron spun filter, which are very inexpensive  
**[0:27:42-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:27:42):**  and easy to change.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:27:44):**  And then you would go to something like a Dalton 0.5 micron ceramic filter, which is  
**[0:27:51-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:27:51):**  cleanable and lasts for very long periods of time.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:27:53):**  So you don't, it's not disposable, not for a very long period of time anyways.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:27:57):**  And then you might hit a carbon filter up just before it goes to your drinking tap.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:28:01):**  So I don't know if I'd carbon filter the entire house, but maybe the water that I consume,  
**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:28:05):**  I might carbon filter depending on what the kind of pollutant loads are around me.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:28:09):**  Sure.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:28:10):**  And that's a very cautious system, but may be required depending on the regulations where  
**[0:28:14-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:28:14):**  you install it, right?  
**[0:28:16-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:28:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:28:17):**  So in North America now, we've got the new CSA NSF Rainwater Harvesting Code, which just  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:28:23):**  came out just at the end of last year, the official code.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:28:28):**  And they're going to want a double barrier system.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:28:31):**  So something like I just described, plus they probably want a UV lamp as well.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:28:35):**  So they're being very, very cautious or potentially an ultra filter, which will actually go below  
**[0:28:41-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:28:41):**  0.5 micron.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:28:44):**  And what they're trying to do there is take out any viruses or harmful microbes.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:28:49):**  But in reality, when we look at the Australian case again, there'd be no major outbreaks  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:28:55):**  in spite of the fact that 3 million people drink without any end of line treatment.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:28:59):**  6 million people in Australia are actively using rainwater and yet there have been no  
**[0:29:03-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:29:03):**  outbreaks.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:29:04):**  And what's really interesting about that number is that we cannot make the same claim about  
**[0:29:09-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:29:09):**  centralized water systems.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:29:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:29:11):**  Yeah, that's incredible.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:29:12):**  And it definitely shifts the perspective and some of the criticism of the things that we're  
**[0:29:17-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:29:17):**  putting in the main line systems, especially disinfectants, chlorinators and things like  
**[0:29:23-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:29:23):**  that can actually do a lot more damage in some cases than the microbes that they're  
**[0:29:29-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:29:29):**  in there to protect again.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:29:31):**  Totally.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:29:32):**  Well, I mean, chlorine plus organic matter in water creates chloroform, which is a known  
**[0:29:36-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:29:36):**  carcinogen.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:29:38):**  So when you look at the bias of Maine's water systems, their bias is managing short term  
**[0:29:45-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:29:45):**  risk over long term risk.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:29:47):**  So they'd rather give people cancer than have E. coli breakouts, basically.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:29:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:29:54):**  No, that makes sense from a liability perspective.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:29:56):**  It's a lot harder to look retroactively and be like, this is what caused the cancer, whereas  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:30:00):**  the E. coli outbreak might be a lot more easy to identify and put blame on.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:30:05):**  Now, let's take a step back.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:30:07):**  There's probably something we should have talked about from the beginning, but walk  
**[0:30:09-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:30:09):**  me through some of the basics of sizing and calculating the needs for your own system  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:30:15):**  and how much you could potentially harvest with roof size or the space that you have  
**[0:30:20-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:30:20):**  available.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:30:21):**  All right.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:30:22):**  So starting with what's possible on your site, just a really simple formula for folks.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:30:28):**  If you take the area of your roof in square meters and you multiply it times the annual  
**[0:30:35-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:30:35):**  rainfall in millimeters, and I know not everybody uses millimeters, but we should move to metric  
**[0:30:41-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:30:41):**  as a society living in the 21st century.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:30:44):**  Yeah, I'm totally on board with that.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:30:47):**  We can end up with liters.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:30:50):**  So you can end up figuring out how many liters you have available to you in a year.  
**[0:30:56-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:30:56):**  And this is a really enlightening number for a lot of people.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:30:59):**  Enlightening in the sense that we typically have a lot less water than we're used to using.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:31:06):**  And so in Calgary, the typical Calgarian uses somewhere between 250 and 400 liters a day,  
**[0:31:14-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:31:14):**  which is just unbelievable.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:31:15):**  It's an enormous amount of water.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:31:19):**  And so that equates to, you know, when I look at the rainwater resource and the typical  
**[0:31:26-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:31:26):**  house size in Calgary, in order to live entirely off of rainwater here, you'd pretty much have  
**[0:31:34-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:31:34):**  to move your, we'll go to the extreme, your 400 liters per day down to about 50 liters  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:31:38):**  per person per day to kind of live within our rainwater budget.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:31:43):**  And so one of the hard parts about rainwater system design is that it's really difficult  
**[0:31:50-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:31:50):**  to optimize a system where rainfall is constantly changing.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:31:56):**  So year from year, you know, you never know how much you're going to get.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:32:00):**  We've got long-term averages, but those long-term averages mean that there are tail events.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:32:07):**  We've got really extreme years where, you know, in 2013, we had twice the amount of  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:32:12):**  rainfall that we typically get in a year in the first month of the spring.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:32:17):**  Whereas last year we had no rainfall at all.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:32:19):**  Literally we had zero millimeters of rain all year long.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:32:21):**  That's remarkable.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:32:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:32:23):**  And those types of variables must make it really difficult to figure out the calculations  
**[0:32:27-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:32:27):**  for this.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:32:28):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:32:29):**  And so you need to build a risk matrix into the way that you do that calculation.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:32:35):**  Now, the other interesting thing is that, so you've got this fixed roof size, you've  
**[0:32:40-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:32:40):**  got a fairly consistent consumption rate.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:32:43):**  Like you can predict that fairly consistently.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:32:46):**  And so you're trying to balance your collection surface with your consumption.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:32:51):**  But the thing is, is that because your consumption is consistent and your rainfall is not, you've  
**[0:32:55-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:32:55):**  got this kind of difficult transient mathematical problem that you've got to solve.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:33:00):**  And that's where the tank comes in.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:33:01):**  So the tank basically acts as this intermediary buffer that allows us to consume water on  
**[0:33:08-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:33:08):**  a daily basis, which is what we need as humans, in spite of the fact that it only rains for  
**[0:33:13-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:33:13):**  a very small percentage of the year.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:33:15):**  And so the tank itself, especially in our climate, but pretty much in every climate  
**[0:33:20-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:33:20):**  is usually the most expensive component in the system.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:33:24):**  In our climate especially, because we typically, if we want to use rain year round, we have  
**[0:33:28-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:33:28):**  to go below grade.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:33:29):**  And our frost line goes as deep as eight feet here, even further when you go north 12 to  
**[0:33:34-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:33:34):**  15 feet sometimes.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:33:36):**  Which means that your tank has to be below that level on the ground so that it doesn't  
**[0:33:40-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:33:40):**  freeze through the winter time.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:33:43):**  We just put in a 5,000 gallon, 20,000 litre tank, not that long ago for a client and it  
**[0:33:49-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:33:49):**  was literally, you know, $20,000.  
**[0:33:52-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:33:52):**  So you do the math on that and it's not inexpensive to have freeze protected water in this ecosystem.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:34:02):**  So we really have to do a lot of, make a lot of intelligent decisions and we need a process,  
**[0:34:10-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:34:10):**  a robust process that allows us to iterate between supply, demand and storage.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:34:17):**  And so we spent a considerable amount of time in our book detailing that out.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:34:23):**  And one of the things that really irritated me when I got back from Australia and over  
**[0:34:29-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:34:29):**  the last decade is that as an engineer, you know, I can use spreadsheets and I can run  
**[0:34:36-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:34:36):**  as many scenarios as I want.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:34:39):**  I'm very proficient with math, I'm very proficient with Excel.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:34:43):**  And so I can do those iterations and I can interpret and interpolate the data in order  
**[0:34:49-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:34:49):**  to come up with a best fit scenario.  
**[0:34:51-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:34:51):**  But trying to provide that to someone who's not proficient in Excel and not necessarily  
**[0:35:00-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:35:00):**  trained in the same way that I am is challenging.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:35:04):**  And so all of the books that I looked for over the last decade had no real good process  
**[0:35:13-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:35:13):**  for optimizing tank size.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:35:15):**  I even bought a $150 textbook from Wiley on rainwater harvesting and to be honest, it  
**[0:35:22-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:35:22):**  was garbage.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:35:23):**  I mean, the book itself was garbage.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:35:26):**  And when it got to tank optimization, they had this like breakout box on the book basically  
**[0:35:31-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:35:31):**  saying like rainwater harvesting optimization, the optimization of rainwater harvesting tanks  
**[0:35:37-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:35:37):**  is something that engineering and architecture companies do and they have proprietary algorithms  
**[0:35:40-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:35:40):**  to do it.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:35:41):**  I was like, this is BS.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:35:42):**  So we actually spent about a month, Michelle and I, kind of taking all of my other spreadsheets  
**[0:35:50-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:35:50):**  and trying to distill down a process that anybody could follow so that they could find  
**[0:35:57-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:35:57):**  an optimized tank.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:35:58):**  And by optimized, what you're really trying to do in your rainwater harvesting system  
**[0:36:02-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:36:02):**  is minimize the tank size and maximize the utility.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:36:08):**  So how do you get the most amount of your system by making your system as small as possible?  
**[0:36:13-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:36:13):**  Because as we shrink the system down, we're able to shrink the cost down.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:36:19):**  And so you want to minimize the system without compromising.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:36:22):**  And you started this interview off with resilience.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:36:25):**  We don't want to compromise on the resilience.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:36:27):**  And so every person is going to have their own context with regards to what resilience  
**[0:36:30-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:36:30):**  means to them or what risks they're trying to mitigate.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:36:34):**  So we want to build that into that iterative process.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:36:37):**  And that's really important.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:36:38):**  And so one chapter in the book is actually dedicated and we've actually delineated out  
**[0:36:44-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:36:44):**  how to build your own Excel spreadsheet to run this process.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:36:49):**  We've also built a professional, beautiful looking tool that you can download.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:36:53):**  I think it's 30 bucks.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:36:54):**  And so we've taken that whole chapter, which you can do for free if you want, but if you  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:36:59):**  can't be bothered, we've built it into an Excel spreadsheet as well that has all of  
**[0:37:04-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:37:04):**  the rainfall data for the US and Canada, and then you can put other rainfall data into  
**[0:37:08-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:37:08):**  it as well if you're in a different country.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:37:11):**  And it takes you through stepwise to get to that resilient, minimized system.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:37:16):**  Wow, that's a phenomenal resource.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:37:19):**  Now let's talk about how someone can prepare to go through the coding and regulatory process  
**[0:37:25-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:37:25):**  where they are.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:37:26):**  Like you said, there's only a certain amount of recommendations that you can make because  
**[0:37:30-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:37:30):**  these rules change quite significantly depending on where you go around the world or sometimes  
**[0:37:35-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:37:35):**  even within the same country.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:37:37):**  So how would someone in a city or a suburb perhaps get started researching what the local  
**[0:37:43-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:37:43):**  codes and permits allow for in their area as far as rainwater harvesting systems?  
**[0:37:49-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:37:49):**  Yeah, so I guess the short answer is, I had a mentor at the beginning of my engineering  
**[0:38:02-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:38:02):**  career and he said, you can get any answer within three phone calls.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:38:06):**  And so that's the simple answer, but depending on where you live in the world, you need to  
**[0:38:17-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:38:17):**  basically be able to figure out what your local municipality, state, province, federal  
**[0:38:23-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:38:23):**  government has stated about this resource.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:38:30):**  And there could be health concerns associated with rainwater because they're uninformed.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:38:36):**  There could be other kind of more opaque reasons why they're not allowing rainwater to be harvested.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:38:45):**  And one of the ones that we're coming up against here in Canada is that there's all sorts of  
**[0:38:55-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:38:55):**  water regulations that exist between, like basically treaties that exist between the  
**[0:39:01-0:39:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:39:01):**  United States and Canada.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:39:03):**  And so there's a lot of concern that if the large adoption of rainwater harvesting occurs,  
**[0:39:09-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:39:09):**  that it's going to change river flow rates crossing the border, which is a little bit  
**[0:39:14-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:39:14):**  ridiculous because eventually all the water ends up in the sink anyways.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:39:18):**  All we're doing is just slowing it down.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:39:21):**  So you kind of have to get to the bottom of that.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:39:23):**  And the best way to do it is just to, if you've never dealt with codes or regulatory systems,  
**[0:39:31-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:39:31):**  start by calling your local municipality and they will basically provide you with a chain  
**[0:39:37-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:39:37):**  of phone calls or conversations that you have to have in order to figure out who's the kind  
**[0:39:44-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:39:44):**  of code official that owns that code or those regulations.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:39:49):**  And from there you can start to make some informed decisions about what you can and  
**[0:39:53-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:39:53):**  can't do in your local municipality.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:39:56):**  I think, this is my personal opinion, that when rainwater harvesting is not allowed,  
**[0:40:04-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:40:04):**  we rapidly enter into a sovereignty issue.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:40:09):**  And as water becomes the kind of predominant issue in the 21st century, which it's in the  
**[0:40:17-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:40:17):**  midst of doing right now, it's important that we are having these conversations with our  
**[0:40:22-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:40:22):**  regulatory authorities.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:40:25):**  Because I mean, when you look at Australia, Australia developed the way that it did because  
**[0:40:28-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:40:28):**  they don't have a water resource.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:40:30):**  You cannot live in that country, in large portions of that country without rainwater.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:40:34):**  And it appears that we're moving into a similar paradigm in other parts of the world as well.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:40:40):**  And so, the more people that call our regulatory authorities where rainwater is not necessarily  
**[0:40:48-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:40:48):**  legal, the more pressure that's placed upon them to start thinking about this as a form  
**[0:40:52-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:40:52):**  of sustainable development.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:40:53):**  Yeah, it's interesting to see as we move forward and water scarcity and sovereignty becomes  
**[0:40:59-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:40:59):**  a larger issue that is more actively addressed by local municipalities all the way up to  
**[0:41:04-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:41:04):**  federal levels, what kind of reaction they're going to have by incentivizing or disincentivizing  
**[0:41:11-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:41:11):**  the public to take control of their own water resilience.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:41:15):**  And up until now, I've mostly seen a disincentivization by governing bodies to people who are trying  
**[0:41:23-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:41:23):**  to move off grid in all kinds of ways and not just become more resilient with their  
**[0:41:29-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:41:29):**  watershed.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:41:30):**  Yeah, there's a lot of fear.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:41:32):**  I think it's the 11th monkey or something like that, that concept that these massive  
**[0:41:39-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:41:39):**  systems that we've created actually require users.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:41:43):**  And there'll be some kind of unspecified number of users that remove themselves from that  
**[0:41:51-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:41:51):**  system, and then the next person in line ends up being the reason that the whole system  
**[0:41:57-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:41:57):**  collapses.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:41:59):**  One example is toilet flushing.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:42:01):**  And so, as we move to low flow toilets, our sewers are struggling to manage with the lower  
**[0:42:10-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:42:10):**  flow rates of water in them because they were all built at half a percent slope.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:42:15):**  And so, as you remove liquid, the solids increase in percentage and the system stops operating.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:42:23):**  So it's not even a matter of, you know, like small little things like that have massive  
**[0:42:30-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:42:30):**  impacts on these grid-based systems.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:42:33):**  And so, I think from the regulatory agent's perspective, they're very concerned about  
**[0:42:40-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:42:40):**  collapse of these grid-based systems, which are so necessary for humans to co-exist in  
**[0:42:48-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:42:48):**  cities.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:42:49):**  I think the elephant in the room here though, I just got an article that I was reading this  
**[0:42:54-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:42:54):**  morning actually before we hopped on this call from the Post Carbon Institute.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:43:01):**  The article is called The Future is Rural.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:43:04):**  And I think the elephant in the room that very few people are wanting to talk about  
**[0:43:08-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:43:08):**  is that cities are not providing us with the sustainable future that we need to move to  
**[0:43:16-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:43:16):**  if we're going to continue to have humanity on the earth.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:43:22):**  I mean, basically what's in the balance right now is, this is going to sound really dire,  
**[0:43:28-0:43:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:43:28):**  but human extinction is like, we're facing that, we're looking at that in the face right  
**[0:43:34-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:43:34):**  now based on how we're currently operating on this planet.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:43:38):**  And a lot of the urbanist, pro-urbanist people on the planet right now are looking at cities  
**[0:43:44-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:43:44):**  as ways of reducing the energy intensity of humanity.  
**[0:43:51-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:43:51):**  But cities can only operate with high energy density resources, which allows us to basically  
**[0:44:01-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:44:01):**  turn cities into organisms.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:44:04):**  And so if you think about plumbing, sewage, water, electricity, natural gas, I mean, these  
**[0:44:10-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:44:10):**  are basically the veins and arteries of a giant organism that just happens to be built  
**[0:44:14-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:44:14):**  up of humans.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:44:17):**  And those arteries require enormous hearts, pumps, in order to send those resources into  
**[0:44:22-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:44:22):**  the city and then extract them back out.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:44:26):**  If in fact, and I would argue there is no if, but a lot of people are arguing that these  
**[0:44:31-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:44:31):**  days, if in fact we do have a looming peak oil issue on the horizon, then as you start  
**[0:44:42-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:44:42):**  to move down the other side of that oil curve, and it really doesn't matter whether it's  
**[0:44:47-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:44:47):**  now or 50 years from now, these massive systems start to decompose.  
**[0:44:57-0:44:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:44:57):**  They no longer operate.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:44:59):**  Yeah, the maintenance on them is enormous as well, to say nothing of the operating costs,  
**[0:45:04-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:45:04):**  especially if fuel prices start to soar.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:45:06):**  Yeah, I mean, you cannot fix water mains at eight feet underground without massive amounts  
**[0:45:14-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:45:14):**  of diesel fuel.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:45:16):**  So sovereignty becomes a big issue, and so that's kind of where this article is going.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:45:21):**  The future is rural.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:45:22):**  We need low energy, decentralized solutions that allow people to take responsibility for  
**[0:45:27-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:45:27):**  their own actions, which is fundamentally the basis of what Mollison was talking about  
**[0:45:31-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:45:31):**  when he wrote the design manual for permaculture.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:45:35):**  Now, local water resilience, as we're talking about, is obviously a much larger concept  
**[0:45:40-0:45:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:45:40):**  than merely harvesting and storing rainwater.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:45:43):**  So what are some of the other essential changes in habits and understanding of water that  
**[0:45:49-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:45:49):**  you'd like to see developed around the world and embraced?  
**[0:45:53-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:45:53):**  So we need to have a more holistic view of waste.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:45:57):**  One of the early experiments we did here on our site was we started harvesting our greywater  
**[0:46:01-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:46:01):**  from our showers and our washing machine.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:46:04):**  And because I'm a bit of a loudmouth, I got in trouble pretty quickly and got a court  
**[0:46:09-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:46:09):**  order with a cease and desist order for our greywater system.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:46:14):**  Again, when we look at the embodied energy of bringing potable water to houses and removing  
**[0:46:21-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:46:21):**  the wastes away, it represents a massive amount, up to 25 to 30% of the energy expenditure  
**[0:46:28-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:46:28):**  of a city is just invested in those two functions.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:46:34):**  And so the other kind of big elephant in the room is that 2030, 2033 is kind of what we're  
**[0:46:40-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:46:40):**  slating for peak phosphorus globally.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:46:43):**  Now, phosphorus is on the periodic table of elements, which means it's atomic and it's  
**[0:46:47-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:46:47):**  a base element, which means that it can be cycled indefinitely into the future with properly  
**[0:46:54-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:46:54):**  designed systems.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:46:55):**  So part of looking at water in a more holistic way means that we're finding ecological systems  
**[0:47:03-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:47:03):**  to cycle our nutrients, to collect our rainwater, cycle our nutrients, grow our food.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:47:12):**  And essentially, the ultimate metaphor to a permaculture system, large or small, is  
**[0:47:22-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:47:22):**  that of a pinball machine.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:47:24):**  So if we think of water as steel pinballs, our job as designers is to look at all of  
**[0:47:31-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:47:31):**  the water resources that we have access to, rain, grey, black, dark grey, stormwater,  
**[0:47:42-0:47:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:47:42):**  and figure out how to put paddles into the system to keep those balls in play as long  
**[0:47:48-0:47:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:47:48):**  as possible on our sites.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:47:50):**  And that's ultimately how we're going to ensure long-term resilience and sustainability and  
**[0:47:56-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:47:56):**  regeneration, which is really what we should be aiming for.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:48:00):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:48:01):**  Now, I really look forward to exploring the larger concept of water resilience and regenerative  
**[0:48:07-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:48:07):**  water systems with you at a later time.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:48:10):**  But since we focus so much on rainwater harvesting, can you tell our listeners how they can get  
**[0:48:14-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:48:14):**  in touch with you directly and where they can go to buy the book?  
**[0:48:18-0:48:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:48:18):**  So folks can connect with us at verge permaculture.ca.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:48:23):**  And we've got a ton.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:48:24):**  I've been writing blogs there for the last 10 years.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:48:27):**  We've also got a YouTube channel with tons of free resources there.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:48:30):**  You can go to YouTube and search verge permaculture.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:48:36):**  And then New Society Publishers has access to our book and we can provide you with a  
**[0:48:41-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:48:41):**  link to that in the show notes below.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:48:44):**  And it's available in both hard copy and e-copy.  
**[0:48:47-0:48:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:48:47):**  And if you do end up getting your copy or if you don't, on the Verge Permaculture website,  
**[0:48:52-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:48:52):**  we actually have a rainwater harvesting toolkit with a ton of free resources, as well as all  
**[0:48:56-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:48:56):**  of the hundreds of research papers that go to support a lot of the claims or statements  
**[0:49:03-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:49:03):**  that we've made in this particular podcast.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:49:05):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:49:06):**  And yeah, like you said, all of those will be on the show notes for this episode on the  
**[0:49:09-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:49:09):**  website at abundantedge.com.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:49:10):**  Rob, it's been such a pleasure talking to you.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:49:13):**  I really look forward to continuing to collaborate and for doing a follow up on the larger nuances  
**[0:49:19-0:49:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:49:19):**  of resilient water systems, especially in the residential context.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rob-avis/#t=0:49:23):**  Thanks so much, man.

**[0:00:03-0:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:00:03):**  Here we dive deep into the worlds of permaculture, natural building, and regenerative living  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:00:07):**  as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself, for your community,  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:00:12):**  and for this beautiful planet that we all share.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:00:14):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I have a great session for you in this week's  
**[0:00:18-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:00:18):**  episode, so let's jump right in.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:00:29):**  Are you looking for the best resources to help you build a regenerative lifestyle?  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:00:34):**  New Society Publishers has been a leader in sustainable publishing for over 30 years.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:00:39):**  They publish good news and solutions for individuals and organizations seeking to change their

**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:00:46):**  Their company mandate goes far beyond the single bottom line of profit.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:00:50):**  They care deeply not only about what they publish, but also how they do business.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:00:54):**  They believe in the authors that they take on and the works that they bring to the marketplace.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:00:59):**  From sustainable living to progressive parenting, New Society Publishers has the books you need  
**[0:01:03-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:01:03):**  to help build a better world.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:01:05):**  Buy your print and ebooks online at www.newsociety.com or at fine bookstores near you.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:01:14):**  Bread has been a passion of mine for years.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:01:17):**  Ever since we tried making it for ourselves when I worked on trail crews in the national  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:01:20):**  parks, I've been fascinated by how much better tasting homemade bread is compared to the  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:01:25):**  majority of what's available on supermarket shelves.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:01:29):**  I eventually worked as a baker for a small artisan bakery in Seattle and have been making  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:01:33):**  my own bread for years now and even building earthen ovens to bake in.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:01:38):**  This interview with Victoria Redhead Miller, author of the new book From No Need to Sour  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:01:42):**  Dough A Simpler Approach to Handmade Bread, was really exciting for me.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:01:47):**  In this interview, we start with a brief history of how we got from homemade bread in every  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:01:51):**  household to Wonder Bread and factory produced pre-sliced loaves.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:01:56):**  Victoria walks us through the whole process, starting from selecting flours and mixing  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:02:00):**  ingredients all the way to finished bread fresh from the oven.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:02:04):**  We also go in depth about the topic of gluten and why many people's aversion to this simple  
**[0:02:08-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:02:08):**  protein might be unfounded.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:02:10):**  This is another information dense interview, so grab your notebooks and I'll turn things  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:02:14):**  over to Victoria.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:02:15):**  Hey Victoria, thank you so much for taking the time to be with me today.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:02:19):**  I'm really looking forward to asking you so many questions about bread because it's been  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:02:23):**  a few years since I left the bakery that I used to work at in Seattle and I can't wait  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:02:27):**  to dive in deep with you again.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:02:28):**  How are you doing today?  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:02:29):**  Oh, I'm doing great and thanks so much for inviting me to be part of this podcast.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:02:33):**  Hey, it's my pleasure.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:02:35):**  So what do you say we just jump right into the questions?  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:02:37):**  I've got lots I'd love to ask you.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:02:39):**  You bet.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:02:40):**  All right, so if you could get us started by telling us a little bit about your personal  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:02:43):**  background, how you became passionate about doing so many of these things for yourself  
**[0:02:48-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:02:48):**  and what sort of opened up your world to the intricacies and the delicious aspects of making  
**[0:02:55-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:02:55):**  your own bread?  
**[0:02:56-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:02:56):**  Okay.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:02:57):**  Yeah, I grew up in Seattle and actually lived there the first 45 years of my life and 12  
**[0:03:04-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:03:04):**  years ago in 2006, my husband and I moved to our off-grid farm about two and a half  
**[0:03:11-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:03:11):**  hours from Seattle.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:03:14):**  And so that's kind of my life story in about two sentences there.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:03:20):**  But as far as the bread goes, my mother started making bread when I was about in eighth grade  
**[0:03:26-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:03:26):**  and I remember just the clearest memories I have of that were of just kind of being  
**[0:03:34-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:03:34):**  fascinated watching this whole process happen, how she would put flour, salt, yeast and water  
**[0:03:42-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:03:42):**  in various combinations in a pot and mix it all up and knead it.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:03:48):**  And I didn't understand the course at all.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:03:50):**  I was in eighth grade.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:03:52):**  I was probably 13 or 14 years old.  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:03:54):**  I didn't understand at all the mechanics of what was happening in that bowl there and  
**[0:04:00-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:04:00):**  why that bread was kind of magically rising.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:04:03):**  And then somehow or other these really simple ingredients, when you stick them in the oven  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:04:09):**  at a certain point, it turns into this wonderful, delicious thing.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:04:14):**  And I think part of my fascination with that was because there's eight kids in our family  
**[0:04:21-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:04:21):**  and my mom was a pretty busy stay-at-home mom and we were always encouraged to find  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:04:27):**  various crafts or sports or whatever to amuse ourselves.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:04:31):**  And my twin sister and I in particular were really into doing all sorts of handcrafted  
**[0:04:37-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:04:37):**  things.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:04:39):**  And some of those all things flour and water paste.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:04:44):**  And so I was kind of looking at that going, gosh, you know, this paste, okay, if I mix  
**[0:04:48-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:04:48):**  the flour and water, I get this paste.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:04:51):**  But if I mix flour and water and add a little yeast into it, it turns into something completely  
**[0:04:57-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:04:57):**  different.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:04:58):**  How's that possible?  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:05:00):**  And I'm not sure if that was exactly my thought process at the time.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:05:05):**  I just remember feeling completely fascinated and mystified by that and very curious.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:05:11):**  I've always just been very curious about how things work.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:05:14):**  I've kind of a mechanical mind and so that's just where my mind goes is to want to understand  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:05:21):**  what's happening, why it's happening, and what I might be able to do to influence  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:05:27):**  or control the variables in that process.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:05:32):**  And so I was about in eighth grade and then when I was in ninth grade, the school that  
**[0:05:38-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:05:38):**  I was going to at the time back then, and this was in the mid-70s, that school required  
**[0:05:45-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:05:45):**  girls in ninth grade to take home economics.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:05:51):**  And one of the things that we did in that class was we learned to bake bread.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:05:56):**  I was frankly a little bored with it at the time because I already pretty much knew how  
**[0:06:00-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:06:00):**  to make bread.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:06:01):**  I kind of learned by looking over my mom's shoulder and at some point she let some of  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:06:08):**  us kids who were interested help with that process.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:06:11):**  And so I was pretty much used to the process already and so I didn't feel like I actually  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:06:16):**  learned an awful lot new about bread in that class.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:06:22):**  But still, it kind of kept the momentum going for me educationally in terms of continuing  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:06:30):**  to pique my interest in the process.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:06:35):**  And if you fast forward a number of years there, in 1999, that was the year my father  
**[0:06:42-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:06:42):**  retired from his job at Boeing, and at the same year he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:06:49):**  And where that comes into this is my clearest memory of that whole thing was when he came  
**[0:06:55-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:06:55):**  home from the doctor one day and said, my doctor says I can eat sourdough bread but  
**[0:06:59-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:06:59):**  not other kinds of bread.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:07:02):**  I don't really have a memory of asking him about that at the time, but I do remember  
**[0:07:06-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:07:06):**  feeling really curious about it because I had not the slightest idea what's different  
**[0:07:13-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:07:13):**  about sourdough bread.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:07:15):**  I didn't understand at all why sourdough bread would be okay to eat but not other kinds of  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:07:20):**  bread because I didn't have the slightest idea what sourdough was.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:07:24):**  I had no idea at all.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:07:27):**  But I'm almost certain, and I wrote about this in the first chapter of my book because  
**[0:07:31-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:07:31):**  I'm almost certain that that was the first time that I got interested in sourdough bread.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:07:37):**  And it kind of went on from there.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:07:39):**  And it just sort of percolated around in the back of my mind for quite some time, and it  
**[0:07:43-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:07:43):**  wasn't until about 10 or 11 years ago that I really started to, it kind of came to the  
**[0:07:50-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:07:50):**  front of my mind and I started making a conscious effort to study this whole thing about sourdough  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:07:56):**  and learn something about it.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:08:02):**  And I've just been completely fascinated with sourdough based breads ever since.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:08:07):**  I still make some types of yeast breads, but the majority of the breads that I make these  
**[0:08:11-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:08:11):**  days are sourdough based.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:08:14):**  And I have this same starter that I started, I think it's almost 11 years ago now, and  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:08:20):**  still have this thing going.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:08:23):**  And I usually make bread once a week, sometimes more often.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:08:28):**  For instance, lately in the course of researching my book, I learned how to make English muffins,  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:08:33):**  which like bagels was always one of these things that seemed sort of mysterious and  
**[0:08:38-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:08:38):**  inaccessible.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:08:40):**  But I learned how to make them, and it turns out they're really easy to make, and my husband's  
**[0:08:42-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:08:42):**  just crazy about them, and so I make those quite frequently.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:08:45):**  And that's a very simple yeast bread.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:08:49):**  But as I said, most of the bread that I make these days is sourdough based, and even within  
**[0:08:54-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:08:54):**  that category, there's just so much variation that you can do in terms of change the type  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:09:01):**  of combination of flours that you use, or it's fermenting at a cooler or a warmer temperature  
**[0:09:07-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:09:07):**  or whatever.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:09:08):**  There's a number of different things that can influence the quality and the taste of  
**[0:09:13-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:09:13):**  the finished bread.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:09:14):**  And to me, it's really fun because I'm somebody who likes to be continually learning,  
**[0:09:20-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:09:20):**  and even within the scope of just sourdough bread, it just feels like there's an unlimited  
**[0:09:27-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:09:27):**  range of things to continue to learn.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:09:30):**  So that's kind of how I got into bread in the first place, and it's evolved over the  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:09:39):**  years to get to be this really quite a serious passion for me.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:09:44):**  Yeah, I love that story about how you sort of found the sticking point that made sense  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:09:48):**  to you, and the health of your father was sort of the catalyst to explore something  
**[0:09:53-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:09:53):**  that you might not have otherwise dived into.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:09:56):**  And I think a lot of other people can relate to those moments, those sort of aha moments,  
**[0:10:01-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:10:01):**  like what is behind this that I don't understand, but clearly is worth exploring.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:10:07):**  Now could you take us through a brief history then of bread and how we got to the point,  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:10:12):**  like you described earlier, where much of what we consume is actually quite unhealthy,  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:10:17):**  we got to the point of Wonder Bread and factory loaves with almost no nutritional value.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:10:22):**  How did that happen?  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:10:25):**  Well yeah, and the history of bread of course goes back thousands of years, and at least  
**[0:10:29-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:10:29):**  as far back as the ancient Egyptians, and in the hot, dry climate of North Africa, they  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:10:38):**  grew a lot of wheat and other grains there, and were making probably some fairly simple  
**[0:10:44-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:10:44):**  flat breads that were either baked on, they were generally baked on hot rocks, which might  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:10:52):**  have been, in certain times of the year, might have just been heated up by the sun, and might  
**[0:10:56-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:10:56):**  have been heated by a fire.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:10:59):**  But that is still the simple flat breads that are just baked over wood heat is still the  
**[0:11:10-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:11:10):**  basis for the bread culture in a lot of different countries in the world, and including countries  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:11:18):**  where they don't grow wheat and they grow gluten-free grains and so forth.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:11:23):**  But at least as recently as the 1800s, and I'm not really sure why this became a thing,  
**[0:11:32-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:11:32):**  but for a lot of years it was kind of a status symbol for, it was an indication that the  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:11:43):**  whiter your flour was, or the whiter your bread was, that was sort of an indication  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:11:47):**  of if your bread was really white, people just assumed that you were rich.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:11:53):**  And it became this status thing where they were adding things like alum and other things  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:11:59):**  to wheat flour to make it look whiter, which seems horrible to me, but that's what they  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:12:05):**  were doing because they could charge more money for that flour, and bakers would buy  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:12:10):**  the whitest flour they could.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:12:14):**  And as I said, I don't really understand why there was such an emphasis on how white  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:12:19):**  this flour was, but that's what it was.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:12:22):**  And this was true through most of the 1800s at least, and then that kind of led up to,  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:12:31):**  in 1927, that's when the Continental Baking Company introduced Wonder Bread, which was  
**[0:12:36-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:12:36):**  this soft, had this bread that was really white, had a nice, thin, soft crust that kids  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:12:44):**  would eat and not complain about, which must have been a huge deal for busy housewives  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:12:50):**  at the time.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:12:54):**  And that just became pretty much an overnight sensation.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:12:57):**  It was, first of all, the housewives up to that point, if they were rich enough, they  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:13:03):**  could afford to have a baker or a cook in their house who would do this for them, but  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:13:07):**  otherwise they were making their own bread almost every day.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:13:11):**  And so this was a huge load off of their plate to be able to buy this beautiful, white, soft  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:13:19):**  bread that, as I said, kids would eat and they would enjoy and not hassle their mothers  
**[0:13:25-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:13:25):**  about.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:13:27):**  And then three years later, in 1930, Wonder Bread introduced the pre-sliced version, which  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:13:31):**  made their life even easier.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:13:35):**  I remember Wonder Bread from when I was a kid and they had those colorful wrappers on  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:13:41):**  them, they were white and they had all these multicolored, brightly colored balloons on  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:13:45):**  them and it said, helps build strong bodies 12 ways, which of course, as a kid, that kind  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:13:51):**  of language kind of impresses you as a kid because who doesn't want a strong body,  
**[0:13:56-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:13:56):**  right?  
**[0:13:57-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:13:57):**  But I didn't understand what that meant.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:13:59):**  I didn't know until many, many years later that the 12 ways that it helps build strong  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:14:05):**  bodies was, you know, that was vitamins and minerals that they added back into that flour  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:14:11):**  because in the processing of that wheat, it was so highly processed and then sifted and  
**[0:14:17-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:14:17):**  sifted and sifted again to take every little bit of bran and germ out of there so it was  
**[0:14:24-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:14:24):**  as white as possible that they pretty much stripped all of the nutrients out of there  
**[0:14:30-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:14:30):**  as well as the dietary fiber, which as you know, is very important to our health.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:14:37):**  And so they then had to add these vitamins back in to make it remotely nutritious and  
**[0:14:45-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:14:45):**  even so, you know, it's never gotten back up to the point of how nutritious it would  
**[0:14:52-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:14:52):**  have been if they had left even some of the bran and germ in there.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:14:56):**  But it was just like this whole— Well, that's just it, isn't it, right?  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:14:59):**  All of these food products love to congratulate themselves for adding nutrition into foods  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:15:04):**  that didn't need it had they not taken it out in the first place.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:15:08):**  Sort of congratulating themselves for doing extra work and still ending up with a less  
**[0:15:12-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:15:12):**  nutritional product.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:15:14):**  Right.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:15:15):**  That's in general, that's exactly my view of it.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:15:18):**  And you know, there may be some exceptions where some of those things actually are fairly  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:15:22):**  good for you, but I think in general when there's a lot of ingredients that include,  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:15:27):**  you know, things like vitamins added back in, I think that's pretty much a clue that  
**[0:15:32-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:15:32):**  that food is so highly processed as to not be all that nutritious for you and is probably  
**[0:15:41-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:15:41):**  a waste of your money.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:15:43):**  And certainly that is true of an awful lot of the mass marketed white flour, especially  
**[0:15:50-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:15:50):**  all purpose flour in this country.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:15:52):**  That is just, you know, and when you see words like fortified or something like that on it,  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:15:57):**  that's a clue too that, you know, because it's not always really clear on the ingredient  
**[0:16:03-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:16:03):**  label exactly what is in there and what's not.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:16:06):**  But if you see words like fortified and that kind of thing, that's a real good clue that  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:16:12):**  that's a very highly processed food product and you'd be better off buying the whole grain  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:16:17):**  product if you can.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:16:19):**  Yes, certainly.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:16:20):**  So with all that in mind, why is it important to rediscover this healthy and delicious staple  
**[0:16:26-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:16:26):**  food for so many cultures?  
**[0:16:28-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:16:28):**  And I know that from my own experience, at least making simple breads is a very accessible  
**[0:16:35-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:16:35):**  process for many people.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:16:37):**  Give me a little reason why we should start to bring this back into our households instead  
**[0:16:42-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:16:42):**  of outsourcing it to companies and the grocery store, frankly.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:16:48):**  Oh, sure.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:16:49):**  You know, there's several, to my mind, there's several really good reasons to make your own  
**[0:16:56-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:16:56):**  bread.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:16:57):**  You know, one of them certainly is that you will, you know, compared to buying good quality  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:17:01):**  bread in a store, you will certainly save a lot of money making your own.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:17:07):**  And plus, of course, as we've been talking about, you have control over the ingredients  
**[0:17:12-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:17:12):**  that are in it.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:17:13):**  You can pick and choose and come up with your own combination and make it as, you know,  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:17:17):**  simple or not simple as you want, but just do it to suit your taste and the needs of  
**[0:17:22-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:17:22):**  your family.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:17:24):**  And I think that alone is a really good reason to do it.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:17:27):**  You know, when I do these presentations, I've been really interested to hear recently that  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:17:35):**  the number one reason why, if people don't make their own bread, I would have thought  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:17:40):**  that the number one reason why they wouldn't do it is because they thought it was too complicated  
**[0:17:45-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:17:45):**  or too hard.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:17:47):**  But actually, what I've been hearing is the main reason why people seem a little intimidated  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:17:53):**  by it or not quite sure about trying it is because they don't really get how they can  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:17:57):**  fit it into their schedule.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:18:00):**  And so I've kind of tweaked my presentations as I've gone along to reflect that because,  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:18:05):**  you know, in the course of doing all this study over a number of years about sourdough  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:18:10):**  breads, you know, I've worked out ways to make the process so much, you know, so much  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:18:15):**  less complicated and easier on my schedule.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:18:20):**  Because that's really got to work for you, otherwise you're just simply not going to  
**[0:18:23-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:18:23):**  do it.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:18:25):**  You know, because most people seem to have an impression, and I don't really blame them,  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:18:30):**  they have an impression that, you know, if I'm going to make bread, I have got to block  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:18:35):**  out a certain number of hours in a day to do that.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:18:39):**  And it's true that the fermentation process can take several hours and all of that, but  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:18:43):**  most of the time involved in making bread is not hands-on.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:18:47):**  Most of the time you're ignoring it, it's doing its own thing.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:18:51):**  And it's actually, that's what I've been working at trying to, you know, to talk to  
**[0:18:55-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:18:55):**  people about how to make this work for your schedule and your lifestyle.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:19:02):**  Because an awful lot of people really want to do it these days, and it's very gratifying  
**[0:19:07-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:19:07):**  to see.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:19:08):**  But, you know, certainly part of the, in recent years of course, there's been this big movement  
**[0:19:14-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:19:14):**  about kind of anti-wheat and anti-gluten that has really discouraged a lot of people from  
**[0:19:23-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:19:23):**  even eating bread, much less making their own.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:19:26):**  And so that's kind of a big topic of conversation, you know, in my presentations as well.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:19:31):**  I get a lot of questions about that.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:19:34):**  And so a lot of what I'm trying to do is convince people that unless you have celiac disease,  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:19:42):**  you know, really wheat can't really hurt you that much.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:19:48):**  There's definitely, I absolutely agree there is such a thing as gluten sensitivity.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:19:53):**  My mother can't eat gluten.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:19:55):**  She does every once in a while, but she really can't eat it very often or else she really  
**[0:19:58-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:19:58):**  reacts to it.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:19:59):**  And there is all of that kind of thing.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:20:03):**  But for most people, wheat is actually a very healthy thing.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:20:07):**  It has been for thousands of years.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:20:09):**  And even today, something like 40% of the world population gets most of its daily nutrition  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:20:16):**  from wheat.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:20:17):**  And a lot of people don't know that, but it's a really important number to me because this  
**[0:20:22-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:20:22):**  is, you know, and this has been true for so long, and it's just kind of, it's a little  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:20:27):**  frustrating to me that, you know, that people are so ready to jump on board with the argument  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:20:32):**  that says that after all of these many thousands of years, all of a sudden wheat is bad for  
**[0:20:37-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:20:37):**  us and we shouldn't eat it.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:20:39):**  You know, when actually it's an extremely nutritious food and quite a lot of the world  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:20:44):**  depends on wheat and other grains as well, of course, for an awful lot of their daily  
**[0:20:49-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:20:49):**  nutrition.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:20:50):**  Well, let's try and unpack that a little bit then.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:20:53):**  Let's try and explore here why gluten has sort of become a pariah in the food industry,  
**[0:20:58-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:20:58):**  or at least these in the last handful of years, and why some of the concern about it is a  
**[0:21:04-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:21:04):**  little unfounded or misdirected.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:21:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:21:08):**  There were a couple of books that came out in the last few years.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:21:14):**  One of them was Wheat Belly, which I think came out in 2011, and then I believe it was  
**[0:21:18-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:21:18):**  2014 when Grain Brain came out.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:21:20):**  And those two books got a lot of attention on Oprah Winfrey Show and both of them.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:21:25):**  I have not read Wheat Belly, but I have read Grain Brain.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:21:29):**  And so I'll just talk about that one for a minute.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:21:35):**  You know, basically this guy who's a medical doctor says that the wheat that we're eating  
**[0:21:40-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:21:40):**  today is genetically different from the wheat that we've been eating for hundreds and thousands  
**[0:21:46-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:21:46):**  of years.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:21:47):**  And while that in itself isn't a bad thing, his argument is that it is so different now  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:21:55):**  that it amounts to practically a poison for us to eat.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:21:59):**  He uses terms like that.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:22:01):**  He referred to gluten as a modern poison.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:22:05):**  And I kind of have a reaction to terms like that.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:22:07):**  I just kind of, you know, I feel like there's an awful lot of fear connected to food in  
**[0:22:11-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:22:11):**  general in our culture.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:22:13):**  And you know, look at those magazines, the women's magazines and the grocery store checkout  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:22:18):**  line, and you'll see headlines like guilt-free cheesecake and things like that.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:22:22):**  There's words like guilt and fear and heart attack on a plate and things like that.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:22:28):**  And I think that's really, I think it's really sad.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:22:31):**  Everybody has to eat, and I think we ought to enjoy it.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:22:36):**  And the truth is that with wheat, as I said, definitely gluten sensitivity exists, definitely  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:22:44):**  celiac disease, it exists.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:22:49):**  But one thing that doesn't get talked about much is that there are other things in wheat  
**[0:22:54-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:22:54):**  and other grains that people can be sensitive to besides gluten.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:23:00):**  But gluten has kind of become this scapegoat.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:23:03):**  And you know, in Grain Brain, you wouldn't believe the laundry list of human ailments  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:23:10):**  and conditions that this guy attributes to gluten.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:23:14):**  And I personally think it's just wrong to take one thing like gluten and say this is  
**[0:23:21-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:23:21):**  the cause of things.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:23:23):**  He says that Alzheimer's is a gluten-related thing.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:23:28):**  The obesity epidemic in this country is gluten-related and a whole lot of other things.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:23:33):**  And I was just really kind of blown away by that.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:23:37):**  And I've done a lot of, in the course of researching the book, I've read many, many study abstracts.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:23:43):**  You know, that are all on this subject of gluten and gluten sensitivity.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:23:49):**  And in some cases, they're how gluten relates to things like sourdough bread, which we can  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:23:54):**  talk about in a little bit if you like.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:23:58):**  But in Italy, both in Italy and Australia, they're doing a lot of very interesting research  
**[0:24:05-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:24:05):**  about gluten and about celiac disease and that kind of thing.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:24:08):**  And I find it really interesting, for example, Italy, which the vast majority of the bread  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:24:16):**  and pasta that is consumed in Italy is 100% white flour.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:24:21):**  Only exception really is up in the north part of Italy when you get closer to Germany, they  
**[0:24:25-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:24:25):**  grow corn and they grow rye up there.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:24:27):**  And so the grains are a little bit different.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:24:30):**  But in general, most of the country, almost all of the bread and the pasta is 100% white  
**[0:24:35-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:24:35):**  flour.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:24:36):**  They have something like an 8.3% obesity rate compared to the US, which is 38% at this point,  
**[0:24:43-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:24:43):**  I think was the last number I heard.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:24:47):**  And so it's a little hard to look at numbers like that and say, well, we're going to blame  
**[0:24:52-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:24:52):**  this on wheat or gluten.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:24:54):**  You know, they eat way more wheat per capita than we do.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:24:59):**  But they have a much lower obesity rate.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:25:01):**  So I think it's important to, you know, to, you know, not everybody has the time, of course.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:25:08):**  I spent a lot of time researching this and I get that not everybody has time to, you  
**[0:25:13-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:25:13):**  know, to go out there and learn all of this stuff.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:25:15):**  I do think it's important, you know, if you think that you might be sensitive to wheat  
**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:25:20):**  or to gluten, first of all, you can talk to your doctor about it.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:25:24):**  Although it's important to know also that except for celiac disease, there is no, as  
**[0:25:29-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:25:29):**  far as I know at this point, there is still no definitive test available that will definitely  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:25:35):**  say whether you have a gluten sensitivity or allergy, there is a definitive blood test  
**[0:25:41-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:25:41):**  for celiac disease.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:25:43):**  But otherwise, there really isn't.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:25:46):**  And so, you know, but I, my feeling is if you feel better when you're not eating wheat  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:25:53):**  or if you feel better when you eliminate gluten from your diet, then you should do that.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:25:58):**  This is a quality of life issue that we're talking about here and, you know, I am, and  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:26:03):**  so I absolutely encourage you to, you know, do what you can to find out if these things  
**[0:26:08-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:26:08):**  work or don't work for you.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:26:10):**  But have it be an informed decision and not just responding to these, you know, what I  
**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:26:15):**  think of as kind of scare tactics like in books like Grain Brain and Wheat Belly that  
**[0:26:20-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:26:20):**  are, you know, basically saying that, you know, not only if you do eat this stuff, you're,  
**[0:26:28-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:26:28):**  you know, you are at great risk of, you know, of causing a number of different medical issues  
**[0:26:35-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:26:35):**  in your life.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:26:36):**  But, you know, on the other hand, if you, if you completely eliminate all those things,  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:26:42):**  then supposedly you're going to have a really healthy life.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:26:46):**  And I don't agree with either of those statements.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:26:48):**  And part of the reason is because, you know, I have a lot of different gluten-free flours  
**[0:26:54-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:26:54):**  in my kitchen right now.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:26:55):**  I've been doing an awful lot of experimenting and testing in the course of working on the  
**[0:26:58-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:26:58):**  book and also trying to find some sort of bread that I can make for my mother that actually  
**[0:27:04-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:27:04):**  tastes good.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:27:06):**  So I've been working a lot with these things and, you know, one of the things, and this  
**[0:27:11-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:27:11):**  does not get any press at all, but an awful lot of the gluten-free grains out there are  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:27:17):**  at least as highly processed as wheat flour is and have little to no nutrition in them.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:27:23):**  And so in the pursuit of eliminating gluten from our lives in the hopes that that will  
**[0:27:29-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:27:29):**  make us healthier people, you know, we're back to this, we're back to 1927 and Wonder  
**[0:27:35-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:27:35):**  Bread and only these flour don't have, you know, 12 vitamins and minerals added back  
**[0:27:42-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:27:42):**  into them.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:27:44):**  Things like rice flour definitely has very little nutrition in it and so there's all  
**[0:27:51-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:27:51):**  these things that kind of come into the mix.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:27:53):**  And when it comes down to it, you know, everybody's got, you know, I often feel like it's a case  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:27:59):**  of the good news is we have choices about what we eat and the bad news is we have choices  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:28:04):**  about what we eat because ultimately we have to make that choice.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:28:09):**  And what I'm saying is, you know, absolutely it is your choice.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:28:13):**  I would never ever tell anyone, you know, to ignore, you know, ignore things about gluten  
**[0:28:21-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:28:21):**  or, you know, anything like that.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:28:23):**  You know, I'm just saying try to have it be a somewhat informed choice and know why you're  
**[0:28:27-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:28:27):**  choosing what you're doing.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:28:31):**  And so it's been a little bit of a hard slog over the last couple of years to convince  
**[0:28:35-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:28:35):**  people that bread is actually not necessarily bad for you.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:28:40):**  We've been just told that for so long.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:28:42):**  I've had people come up to me in the coffee shop where I do my internet stuff and ask  
**[0:28:47-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:28:47):**  me what book I'm working on and I say, oh, well, it's about bread.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:28:50):**  And they'll say things like, oh, yeah, you know, I probably won't buy that book because  
**[0:28:54-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:28:54):**  I don't really eat bread anymore because, oh my gosh, it's so bad for you.  
**[0:28:57-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:28:57):**  Wow, that's unfortunate.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:28:58):**  And then when I try, yeah, and when I try to draw them out into conversation about that,  
**[0:29:03-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:29:03):**  they usually can't tell me why they believe it's bad for you.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:29:07):**  They just believe it is.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:29:09):**  And so that's part of what that's also in a smaller part, that's kind of what I'm trying  
**[0:29:14-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:29:14):**  to do with this to kind of try to help people get a little bit past their fears, both of  
**[0:29:21-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:29:21):**  the bread making process and the bread itself.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:29:23):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:29:24):**  Well, I really appreciate you breaking that down and explaining that, giving a better  
**[0:29:29-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:29:29):**  perspective and understanding of both the history and some of the misconceptions.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:29:35):**  It seems like with everything, there's always two sides, and if you go too far in the extremes  
**[0:29:41-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:29:41):**  of one or the other, you miss some of the nuances, the history and the practical applications.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:29:47):**  And especially in such a staple food and crop for almost all of human history, it's a shame  
**[0:29:57-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:29:57):**  to kind of throw the baby out with the bathwater just because there are many products that  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:30:02):**  are not either good for us or nutritionally valuable doesn't mean that there aren't others  
**[0:30:07-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:30:07):**  or other techniques that would replace that as a proper food staple the way it has been  
**[0:30:14-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:30:14):**  for so long.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:30:15):**  Oh, I absolutely agree, and that's one of the things I often say at these presentations,  
**[0:30:20-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:30:20):**  you know, is, you know, this, how is it that this food that is, as you said, so basic to  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:30:27):**  just about every culture in the world and has been for a long, long time, how is it  
**[0:30:32-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:30:32):**  that we've gotten to the point of being both afraid of eating it and intimidated about  
**[0:30:36-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:30:36):**  making it?  
**[0:30:37-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:30:37):**  It's, you know, the vast majority of the breads that I make, you know, have four ingredients  
**[0:30:43-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:30:43):**  in them.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:30:44):**  It's flour, salt, yeast, and water.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:30:46):**  And when I say yeast, sometimes it's commercial yeast, sometimes it's a sourdough starter,  
**[0:30:50-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:30:50):**  but there's some sort of leavening in there.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:30:52):**  But it's basically those four ingredients in different combinations.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:30:56):**  And, but, but yeah, that's, that's to me a really big, a really big issue is, you know,  
**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:31:08):**  but I, I just, I feel like there's, in the last few years, especially since Grain Brain  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:31:13):**  and Wheat Belly came out and they're both big best sellers and a lot of publicity and  
**[0:31:18-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:31:18):**  that sort of thing, that, you know, as I said, gluten and by extension wheat because, you  
**[0:31:24-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:31:24):**  know, wheat is the number one gluten grain.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:31:27):**  It has by far a lot more gluten in it than the other two gluten grains, which are barley  
**[0:31:32-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:31:32):**  and rye.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:31:33):**  And so wheat has just, as I said, become this kind of scapegoat.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:31:37):**  Unfortunately it does seem to be happening with so many other foods as well.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:31:42):**  Bread just being one of them.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:31:43):**  Now if we could switch, switch topics for just a second, I'd like to start to get into  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:31:47):**  the process of making this and show people that it is very accessible.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:31:52):**  So let's start from the beginning and talk about different ingredients needed to make  
**[0:31:56-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:31:56):**  a basic loaf.  
**[0:31:57-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:31:57):**  I know you mentioned the four that you always use.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:31:59):**  There's a huge variety of specialty flours with different characteristics and behaviors,  
**[0:32:04-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:32:04):**  but I know from having been a baker myself and making my own bread for years that it's  
**[0:32:07-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:32:07):**  amazingly simple and cheap to get started on your own.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:32:10):**  So could you help to sort of unpack the process for us?  
**[0:32:14-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:32:14):**  Sure.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:32:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:32:16):**  And, and as you said, there's a huge variety of flours out there.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:32:19):**  It can be very confusing and so, but you know, really it's, it's very simple in terms of  
**[0:32:28-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:32:28):**  ingredients and what I would really recommend when people are just starting out is, you  
**[0:32:32-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:32:32):**  know, and the available, part of what's confusing too is the availability of, of certain grains.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:32:37):**  It varies quite a lot depending on what part of the country you're in.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:32:42):**  And, and so, and, and there's even sub-variations within that, for example, the, in Washington  
**[0:32:49-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:32:49):**  state where I live, the eastern part of the country, east of the Cascade Mountains, where  
**[0:32:54-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:32:54):**  it's much hotter and drier than western Washington, they grow a lot of wheat out there.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:32:59):**  And they, and they produce, a lot of the wheat they grow out there is fairly soft and they  
**[0:33:04-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:33:04):**  make things like all-purpose flour from that.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:33:06):**  The all-purpose flour that comes from Washington state is really different from the all-purpose  
**[0:33:10-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:33:10):**  flour you'll find in a southern state just because of the, the varieties of wheat they  
**[0:33:15-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:33:15):**  grow are different and the way that they, that they process them are different.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:33:19):**  And so there's a lot of variation there but, and I get asked a lot, you know, if I have  
**[0:33:24-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:33:24):**  recommendations of particular brands of flour and I really don't.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:33:27):**  And partly it's because, as I said, availability is, you know, is so unpredictable in different  
**[0:33:33-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:33:33):**  places.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:33:34):**  But I just, you know, what, the, my favorite bread, my favorite sourdough bread that I  
**[0:33:40-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:33:40):**  make pretty regularly is, and I'm just kinda, I'm used to doing things in percentages and  
**[0:33:45-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:33:45):**  by, and measuring things by weight.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:33:48):**  What I like to do, my favorite sourdough bread is, it's 70% white flour and when I say white  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:33:56):**  flour, this particular flour is an unbleached, organic bread flour.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:34:01):**  That's different from all-purpose flour.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:34:04):**  Bread flour is, it has, it's not super high protein.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:34:09):**  The one that I use is about 11.5% protein.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:34:13):**  Somewhere around 11 or 12% is a really good number to shoot for, you know, with, with  
**[0:34:19-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:34:19):**  your bread flour.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:34:21):**  I like this combination of 70% white, 24% whole wheat flour and 6% rye.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:34:29):**  And that's normally what I use.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:34:31):**  Usually I make, you know, I make breads that are, some breads that like ciabatta, which  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:34:36):**  is my, I make hot dog buns with ciabatta dough.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:34:40):**  That's an Italian bread that's 100% white flour.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:34:44):**  And we just like making things like hot dog buns and that sort of thing with that kind  
**[0:34:49-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:34:49):**  of, with that kind of dough.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:34:51):**  So you know, you can, what I would recommend when people first start out is, and I say  
**[0:34:58-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:34:58):**  this in the book, where it's just kind of, the book is sort of organized into what I  
**[0:35:01-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:35:01):**  call comfort zones.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:35:04):**  And so for example, the first comfort zone in there is just basic no-knead yeast breads.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:35:10):**  And I recommend that, you know, if you're just starting out and you've never made  
**[0:35:13-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:35:13):**  bread before or it's been a really long time since you've made bread, start out there,  
**[0:35:17-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:35:17):**  get comfortable with the process or get comfortable with it again.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:35:21):**  And then if you want to, you can move on to some other, you know, slightly more involved  
**[0:35:26-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:35:26):**  process.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:35:27):**  And I really recommend that you start out with some kind of, you know, whatever is the  
**[0:35:31-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:35:31):**  good kind of unbleached, it's really important to use unbleached flour, I think, the bleaching  
**[0:35:36-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:35:36):**  agents that they use.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:35:38):**  And again, this dates back to back in the old days when it was really super important  
**[0:35:43-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:35:43):**  that the flour be really, and also the, but actually the function of the bleaching agents  
**[0:35:52-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:35:52):**  is actually to essentially artificially oxidize the flour.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:35:56):**  And so what that amounts to for you and me is it extends the shelf life of that flour.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:36:03):**  That's why they do that.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:36:04):**  I really highly recommend you avoid bleached flour partly because bleaching agents really  
**[0:36:10-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:36:10):**  inhibit fermentation, which I'll talk about in just a minute here.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:36:16):**  So unbleached bread flour, you can usually find it in bags on a grocery store shelf.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:36:22):**  I really recommend if you can, if you have a resource nearby for this, to buy the flour  
**[0:36:28-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:36:28):**  in bulk from a place where they sell a lot of flour and there's pretty rapid turnover,  
**[0:36:35-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:36:35):**  if you can do that.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:36:37):**  Yeast, you know, for yeast bread, I like instant yeast just because it dissolves really quickly  
**[0:36:45-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:36:45):**  and it's just very easy to use.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:36:47):**  There's absolutely nothing wrong with using active dry yeast.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:36:51):**  It just takes a little longer to dissolve it.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:36:53):**  And we're only talking a matter of minutes.  
**[0:36:55-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:36:55):**  It's not a big deal.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:36:56):**  So either instant yeast or active dry yeast.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:37:00):**  I like using sea salt.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:37:03):**  Definitely don't recommend using iodized salt if you can avoid it.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:37:07):**  Again for the inhibition of fermentation, right?  
**[0:37:10-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:37:10):**  Yes, exactly.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:37:14):**  And also the only other kind of sometimes tricky thing about salt is, and again, I'm  
**[0:37:19-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:37:19):**  used to measuring everything by weight.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:37:24):**  And so you have to be a little bit careful depending on what kind of salt you use because  
**[0:37:27-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:37:27):**  for instance, a tablespoon of kosher salt doesn't weigh as much as a tablespoon of sea  
**[0:37:32-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:37:32):**  salt.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:37:34):**  And so there's a little bit of tricky stuff in there but in general, I just like to use  
**[0:37:40-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:37:40):**  sea salt.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:37:41):**  I'm somebody who, although I do a lot of experimenting on certain levels with things, I like to have  
**[0:37:47-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:37:47):**  a basic set of just a few of my go-to ingredients that I always use the same brand and I'm used  
**[0:37:55-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:37:55):**  to how it behaves when I mix it up and knead it and all that sort of thing.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:37:59):**  I like to just pick something and more or less stick with it.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:38:04):**  And definitely recommend that if you're just kind of starting out.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:38:09):**  And water, people don't talk that much about the water but there are a couple of points  
**[0:38:13-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:38:13):**  to make about the water.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:38:14):**  Yeah, I would definitely recommend avoiding chlorinated water if you can.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:38:19):**  If that's all you have is chlorinated tap water, what you can do is the day before you're  
**[0:38:25-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:38:25):**  going to or the night before you're going to make your bread, just run a pan or a bowl  
**[0:38:31-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:38:31):**  full of that water or as much water as you need for the bread and just let it sit overnight.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:38:40):**  And most or all of the chlorine will have dissipated by the morning.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:38:44):**  It will kind of evaporated into the air.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:38:47):**  And otherwise, I pretty much recommend using some kind of spring water if you can.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:38:54):**  Bottle water is just fine.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:38:56):**  I would not recommend using distilled water and that's mostly because there's various  
**[0:39:03-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:39:03):**  minerals in spring water that get taken out during the distillation process and those  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:39:08):**  minerals are really, they're, I wouldn't say exactly, you know, indispensable but they're  
**[0:39:13-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:39:13):**  fairly essential to the fermentation process.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:39:17):**  They help the yeast get really active in the fermentation process and so avoid distilled  
**[0:39:25-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:39:25):**  water, avoid chlorinated water.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:39:28):**  That's the bottom line of that part of it.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:39:33):**  So there you go, flour, salt, yeast and water and again by the yeast, you know, you might  
**[0:39:40-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:39:40):**  substitute at some point a sourdough starter for that kind of thing but just in the beginning,  
**[0:39:45-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:39:45):**  this is the really simple way to do it and it's the kind of bread I made for a lot of  
**[0:39:49-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:39:49):**  years before I discovered an interest in sourdough.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:39:52):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:39:53):**  So now what are the different stages once you've made the dough going through proofing,  
**[0:39:58-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:39:58):**  forming and baking?  
**[0:39:59-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:39:59):**  If you could help to explain about the amount of time that that would take and how someone  
**[0:40:04-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:40:04):**  could schedule around the process so that though, you know, overall it might take four  
**[0:40:09-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:40:09):**  to six hours to have a finished loaf, there's maybe only 20 minutes of active time in my  
**[0:40:15-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:40:15):**  experience of working with the material.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:40:20):**  Right and it's important to know too that I am used to, you know, the times and things  
**[0:40:25-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:40:25):**  that I generally talk about are from my own experience and I like to hand knead my bread.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:40:32):**  Takes a little longer than doing it by machine but that's just what I'll talk about because  
**[0:40:38-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:40:38):**  that's what my experience is.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:40:41):**  To make it, you know, just a real simple no knead yeast bread, the parts that you see  
**[0:40:50-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:40:50):**  there are you're mixing up the dough that is putting the flour, salt, yeast and water  
**[0:40:53-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:40:53):**  into a bowl, stirring it all up so the flour is all hydrated and then with no knead dough,  
**[0:41:03-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:41:03):**  you don't really knead it but you do have to stir it for a couple of minutes to make  
**[0:41:08-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:41:08):**  sure everything is really thoroughly mixed.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:41:11):**  And then the next part of the process and this is true of any kind of bread, the next  
**[0:41:15-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:41:15):**  part of the process is called fermentation.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:41:19):**  It's also and especially in some of the older cookbooks, you know, it's called usually the  
**[0:41:24-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:41:24):**  first rising and that's just when that dough is, it's sitting in a bowl and in a, you know,  
**[0:41:32-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:41:32):**  set room temperature usually and what's happening is fermentation and just real briefly the  
**[0:41:38-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:41:38):**  fermentation process, this is true of any fermented food, you know, pickles or sauerkraut  
**[0:41:44-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:41:44):**  or kombucha or anything.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:41:46):**  What's happening in fermentation is yeast comes in contact with a source of sugar and  
**[0:41:51-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:41:51):**  in this case, it's the starches in the grain and which is a carbohydrate and the yeast  
**[0:41:58-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:41:58):**  consumes that carbohydrate and produces as a result as essentially a waste product.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:42:05):**  It produces both alcohol and carbon dioxide and so that's what's happening while that,  
**[0:42:12-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:42:12):**  that's what is making those carbon dioxide bubbles that are being formed in the fermentation  
**[0:42:16-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:42:16):**  process.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:42:17):**  That's why that bread dough is rising and it's kind of important to note here too that  
**[0:42:25-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:42:25):**  the reason why that dough will keep rising and keeps rising, you know, and without those  
**[0:42:32-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:42:32):**  bubbles bursting and having the dough fall apart is because of the presence of gluten.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:42:37):**  Gluten is very, very stretchy, very elastic and that allows that dough to expand, allows  
**[0:42:43-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:42:43):**  those gas bubbles in there to expand without breaking and that's, it's much like the difference  
**[0:42:49-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:42:49):**  between regular chewing gum and bubble gum.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:42:52):**  Bubble gum is just much more elastic and you can blow a lot bigger bubble before it breaks  
**[0:42:57-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:42:57):**  than with regular gum.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:42:59):**  It's much like that.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:43:00):**  So during the fermentation process with a regular yeast bread at room temperature that  
**[0:43:06-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:43:06):**  will typically take, it can take anywhere from an hour to two hours typically.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:43:13):**  It depends a little on the temperature in the room.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:43:15):**  It depends on how much yeast you put in and but in general, it's that first rising or  
**[0:43:22-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:43:22):**  first fermentation will take about an hour to two hours and the way that you'd usually  
**[0:43:27-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:43:27):**  know that that is done is the dough has basically doubled in size or doubled in volume and at  
**[0:43:35-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:43:35):**  that point, the next part of the process is a lot of people think you punch down that  
**[0:43:40-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:43:40):**  dough and they kind of take that literally and think you need to, you know, actually  
**[0:43:44-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:43:44):**  make a fist and punch it.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:43:46):**  What you really are doing is just what I would call gently deflating it because it has risen  
**[0:43:51-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:43:51):**  quite a lot.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:43:52):**  There's a lot of gas bubbles in there and you just press down on it gently just to lightly  
**[0:43:56-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:43:56):**  deflate it.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:43:57):**  At that point, you're going to shape it in the kind of loaf that you want to end up with  
**[0:44:02-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:44:02):**  and that might be, you know, you might be baking it in a pan, you know, like to make  
**[0:44:06-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:44:06):**  a sandwich type loaf or you might do like I do most of the time and make some sort of  
**[0:44:11-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:44:11):**  free form shape that's going to be baked, you know, either on a baking sheet or in my  
**[0:44:16-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:44:16):**  case I like to bake it on a baking stone.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:44:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:44:20):**  That was always my favorite portion.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:44:21):**  When I worked at the bakery, Tallgrass Bakery in Seattle up in Ballard, that was my main  
**[0:44:26-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:44:26):**  job.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:44:27):**  I was the former and learned a lot of different techniques, especially from my excellent colleagues.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:44:33):**  Everything from baguettes to oh boy, we did so many different ones, compagnon.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:44:40):**  I even forget the names now, but we probably had about 20 or 30 different types that we  
**[0:44:43-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:44:43):**  formed and that was the best part.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:44:45):**  Nice.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:44:46):**  Yeah, and that's one of the many fun things for me, you know, with bread is again, you  
**[0:44:51-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:44:51):**  can just take this really simple four ingredient dough and come up with practically unlimited  
**[0:44:57-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:44:57):**  variations on them in terms of shape and style, you know.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:45:07):**  So once you shape your dough, then the dough is going to go through a second much shorter  
**[0:45:15-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:45:15):**  fermentation or rising and that's usually referred to as the proofing stage and contrary  
**[0:45:21-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:45:21):**  to popular opinion, this, you do not need a special proofing box or put it in your oven  
**[0:45:28-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:45:28):**  on low or something where you're artificially raising the temperature to do that.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:45:33):**  It works just fine at room temperature.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:45:35):**  It just takes slightly longer, but when I make bread, typically that proofing stage  
**[0:45:41-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:45:41):**  takes barely an hour and the dough is not necessarily going to double in volume like  
**[0:45:46-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:45:46):**  it does during the first fermentation.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:45:51):**  And then of course you're going to bake it and people ask me a lot about what temperature  
**[0:45:58-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:45:58):**  to bake bread out.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:45:59):**  That depends on so many different variables.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:46:01):**  It depends on whether it's a free form loaf or it's in a pan and a number of other things,  
**[0:46:07-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:46:07):**  but most kinds of bread that I make, the sourdough breads I typically bake at a fairly high temperature  
**[0:46:12-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:46:12):**  of 475 Fahrenheit.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:46:16):**  Most kinds of bread I think that I make are somewhere between about 400 and 475.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:46:21):**  And of course the time that you're going to spend baking it is going to depend on various  
**[0:46:25-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:46:25):**  things too.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:46:30):**  So that's pretty much it.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:46:32):**  You mix the dough.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:46:33):**  It goes through a first fermentation.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:46:35):**  You deflate it and shape it and then it goes through a shorter second fermentation or proofing  
**[0:46:40-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:46:40):**  and then it's baked.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:46:44):**  And then of course it's cooled and presumably stored.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:46:48):**  Of course in our case half the loaf gets eaten the same day it's made because we both...  
**[0:46:55-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:46:55):**  Oh man, with the group that I live with, there's no way a loaf of bread would last more than  
**[0:46:59-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:46:59):**  like an afternoon.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:47:01):**  I'm never worried about storing it.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:47:03):**  Oh sure, exactly.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:47:04):**  Yeah, but although it is one big advantage of sourdough based breads is they do have  
**[0:47:09-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:47:09):**  a better shelf life.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:47:12):**  But as you said, in our house shelf life is usually not much of an issue because we do  
**[0:47:17-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:47:17):**  go through it even just with the two of us.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:47:20):**  Of course.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:47:22):**  So that's pretty much it in a nutshell.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:47:25):**  And there's a wide variation in terms of depending on what kind of bread you're making in terms  
**[0:47:30-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:47:30):**  of how long that process takes.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:47:33):**  I often tell this story at the presentations about how a couple of years ago I discovered  
**[0:47:39-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:47:39):**  that I was getting up at like two in the morning to do something with my bread dough.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:47:44):**  And I remember thinking, what in the world am I doing?  
**[0:47:47-0:47:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:47:47):**  I'm not a professional baker.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:47:48):**  I'm making one loaf of bread.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:47:51):**  And then I could never get back to sleep properly after that and I just thought I was crazy.  
**[0:47:56-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:47:56):**  And so that was when I started figuring out how to, rather than shortening the process,  
**[0:48:01-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:48:01):**  I actually lengthened the process to where the whole process, when I'm making sourdough  
**[0:48:06-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:48:06):**  bread, the whole process from when I refresh that sourdough starter to when I've baked  
**[0:48:11-0:48:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:48:11):**  that bread takes a good 24 hours or more.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:48:14):**  But it's so much easier on my schedule.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:48:16):**  I'm not getting up in the middle of the night.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:48:18):**  And it's so much easier.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:48:22):**  And I'm making better bread.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:48:24):**  It's one of the things that I learned kind of in more recent years was that a general  
**[0:48:28-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:48:28):**  rule of thumb with real quality baking is the longer the fermentation period, the better  
**[0:48:33-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:48:33):**  the flavor of the bread.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:48:35):**  And that, by the way, a lot of people think that's only true of sourdough bread, but that's  
**[0:48:38-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:48:38):**  not so.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:48:39):**  It's also true of yeast breads.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:48:40):**  So as you were mentioning before, sometimes when you made bread, the fermentation would  
**[0:48:45-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:48:45):**  – sometimes the whole process would take four hours or sometimes closer to six.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:48:49):**  Well, you may have noticed, I don't have that sophisticated of a palate, but if you're  
**[0:48:54-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:48:54):**  paying attention, you probably will notice a difference between the taste of the bread  
**[0:49:00-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:49:00):**  in that six-hour loaf compared to the four-hour loaf because it's been fermenting for longer.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:49:06):**  So speaking of that, I know you mentioned that you wanted to go more into the process  
**[0:49:11-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:49:11):**  of fermentation.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:49:12):**  And this was really, as you mentioned as well, the sticking point for you, what got you first  
**[0:49:17-0:49:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:49:17):**  interested in trying sourdough.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:49:19):**  So what is the difference in the nutritional value and maybe even the chemical makeup of  
**[0:49:24-0:49:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:49:24):**  a bread that has been fermented at all or even longer that changes the nutritional value  
**[0:49:31-0:49:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:49:31):**  and basically turns it into a different food?  
**[0:49:33-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:49:33):**  Yeah, it really does.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:49:36):**  And a lot of people think that because it is – and I confess, I don't know very  
**[0:49:40-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:49:40):**  much about this part of the process, but I'll just mention it briefly because I get a lot  
**[0:49:45-0:49:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:49:45):**  of questions about it.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:49:46):**  Because bread is a fermented food, these days we're hearing a lot about probiotics and  
**[0:49:53-0:49:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:49:53):**  a lot of people ask me about this.  
**[0:49:55-0:50:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:49:55):**  So isn't sourdough bread better for me to eat because of these probiotics?  
**[0:50:01-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:50:01):**  Well, first of all, all bread is fermented, not just sourdough bread.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:50:06):**  All bread is a fermented food.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:50:07):**  If it wasn't fermented, it would be a solid brick that you might use for a weapon but  
**[0:50:12-0:50:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:50:12):**  you wouldn't want to eat it.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:50:14):**  And so all bread is fermented.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:50:18):**  But my understanding is that the probiotics that they're talking about in there which  
**[0:50:24-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:50:24):**  come from the lactobacillus bacteria which is also an important part of the fermentation  
**[0:50:29-0:50:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:50:29):**  process and actually the lactobacillus bacteria is what's responsible for most of the flavor  
**[0:50:35-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:50:35):**  components of sourdough bread.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:50:39):**  But some of those things get destroyed at a certain temperature up above, I think it's  
**[0:50:43-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:50:43):**  above 180 or so degrees Fahrenheit.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:50:46):**  And so as you probably know since you worked in a commercial bakery, the internal temperature  
**[0:50:53-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:50:53):**  of a finished loaf of bread is going to be about 200 degrees Fahrenheit and possibly  
**[0:50:57-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:50:57):**  205, somewhere in that range there.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:51:00):**  And so it's unclear from what I've read so far, it seems likely that by the time that  
**[0:51:07-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:51:07):**  bread is baked, there's not much of that probiotic benefit in there anymore.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:51:13):**  However, there are some other benefits with sourdough bread.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:51:18):**  For example, as I mentioned when my father got diagnosed with diabetes and he was told  
**[0:51:25-0:51:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:51:25):**  he could eat sourdough bread, well, it is true that I don't remember the exact numbers  
**[0:51:30-0:51:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:51:30):**  but it is definitely true that sourdough based breads are definitely lower on the glycemic  
**[0:51:36-0:51:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:51:36):**  index than yeast breads.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:51:39):**  And I'm assuming that that's at least one of the reasons why the doctor told my father  
**[0:51:44-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:51:44):**  he could eat sourdough breads.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:51:48):**  And yeah.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:51:50):**  And it's also true that, and this is especially true with sourdough breads that are fermented  
**[0:51:56-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:51:56):**  for extended periods of time, like in some cases 24 hours or more, I've heard of people,  
**[0:52:03-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:52:03):**  I've heard of bakers who ferment their sourdough bread for even 36 hours or more before they  
**[0:52:07-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:52:07):**  bake it.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:52:09):**  And the longer it's true, and I found this out from these studies, especially the ones  
**[0:52:13-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:52:13):**  happening in Australia, that the action of it's not so much the wild yeast in the sourdough  
**[0:52:19-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:52:19):**  starter, it's more the action of the lacto, the specific strains of lactobacillus bacteria  
**[0:52:27-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:52:27):**  that are in there that go to work on the gluten in that wheat.  
**[0:52:31-0:52:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:52:31):**  And somehow, nobody really understands exactly why this is happening, but it appears pretty  
**[0:52:41-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:52:41):**  clear that it is happening, that somehow or other in the fermentation process, the gluten  
**[0:52:47-0:52:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:52:47):**  in that wheat or other grain is essentially being deactivated.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:52:53):**  And to the point where they've done a lot of studies, nobody's quite ready to come out  
**[0:52:58-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:52:58):**  and say at this point, definitely you can, if you're sensitive or allergic to gluten,  
**[0:53:04-0:53:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:53:04):**  you can definitely eat sourdough based breads with impunity, but they're getting pretty  
**[0:53:09-0:53:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:53:09):**  close to that.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:53:11):**  Everybody says we need to do more studies, but essentially what the studies so far have  
**[0:53:15-0:53:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:53:15):**  shown, and these are mostly with pretty small groups of people, like a couple of dozen people  
**[0:53:19-0:53:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:53:19):**  at a time, is that people who, even people who have been diagnosed with celiac disease,  
**[0:53:26-0:53:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:53:26):**  have been able to eat a limited amount of sourdough based bread without a measurable  
**[0:53:32-0:53:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:53:32):**  reaction in their gut.  
**[0:53:35-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:53:35):**  And to me, that's really exciting news.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:53:38):**  Yeah, that's remarkable.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:53:40):**  You know, it is.  
**[0:53:43-0:53:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:53:43):**  And as I said, everybody's kind of being a little hesitant to kind of come out and say  
**[0:53:47-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:53:47):**  we know this for sure, but they're getting very close to that.  
**[0:53:52-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:53:52):**  And they're doing more studies and they've done a bunch of specific studies, like for  
**[0:53:58-0:54:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:53:58):**  instance with teenage children and specific groups like that, and have given them a measured  
**[0:54:05-0:54:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:54:05):**  amount of sourdough based bread or a measured amount, the equivalent in yeast bread, and  
**[0:54:12-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:54:12):**  they can actually measure the reaction in the gut to that.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:54:16):**  If you're going to react to gluten at all, it's going to be in the small intestine.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:54:19):**  And they can actually measure that and see in real time, which is really cool.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:54:24):**  But the results that they've come up with was basically that sourdough bread is much  
**[0:54:31-0:54:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:54:31):**  less likely to bother you than yeast bread.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:54:37):**  And as I said, nobody's really entirely certain of the exact mechanics of that and why that  
**[0:54:43-0:54:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:54:43):**  is so, but it appears to be so.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:54:46):**  And I have friends myself who I have made sourdough bread for, and one friend in particular  
**[0:54:51-0:55:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:54:51):**  I'm thinking of in the town near where I live, who she doesn't have celiac disease, but she  
**[0:55:00-0:55:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:55:00):**  feels she's pretty sensitive or possibly allergic to gluten, but she can eat the bread that  
**[0:55:04-0:55:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:55:04):**  I give her without any reaction at all to it.  
**[0:55:08-0:55:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:55:08):**  And she's of course very happy about that.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:55:10):**  I can imagine.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:55:11):**  And yeah.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:55:14):**  And so to me, it's really interesting to do.  
**[0:55:19-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:55:19):**  And now that the book is done and has gone to press, I am getting back to spending some  
**[0:55:25-0:55:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:55:25):**  more time with that research because I had to leave off with the research at a certain  
**[0:55:30-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:55:30):**  point because I had to finish the book.  
**[0:55:33-0:55:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:55:33):**  But I just got totally immersed in this research.  
**[0:55:35-0:55:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:55:35):**  It was so fascinating to me, the stuff that they are finding out about this.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:55:41):**  And I've been talking about this.  
**[0:55:42-0:55:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:55:42):**  I've been out on the speaking circuit talking about this subject for about a year and a  
**[0:55:46-0:55:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:55:46):**  half now, and I get so many questions about this exact thing.  
**[0:55:50-0:55:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:55:50):**  I'm so looking forward to the day when I can go to these audiences and say, hey, check  
**[0:55:55-0:55:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:55:55):**  this out.  
**[0:55:56-0:55:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:55:56):**  This is what we now know.  
**[0:55:59-0:56:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:55:59):**  And it's also very exciting because it's kind of going right along with what I've been talking  
**[0:56:06-0:56:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:56:06):**  about, about us getting back to the place where we're not so intimidated or afraid about  
**[0:56:16-0:56:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:56:16):**  eating bread or even making our own bread.  
**[0:56:20-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:56:20):**  And that to me is really great news.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:56:22):**  I've had so many people come up to me in recent months, even young people, even 20-somethings,  
**[0:56:28-0:56:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:56:28):**  and say, gosh, I'd really like to learn to make bread.  
**[0:56:32-0:56:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:56:32):**  And it's so encouraging to me because it has felt like in just the last few months really,  
**[0:56:37-0:56:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:56:37):**  it's felt to me like I'm hearing a lot less than compared to a year ago.  
**[0:56:41-0:56:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:56:41):**  I'm hearing a lot less now of this kind of thing of, oh, I don't want to eat bread because  
**[0:56:46-0:56:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:56:46):**  it's bad for me.  
**[0:56:47-0:56:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:56:47):**  Or I can't eat gluten because it's bad for me.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:56:50):**  I'm hearing less of that now.  
**[0:56:53-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:56:53):**  And so I am really hopeful that the timing of this book coming out is going to be good  
**[0:56:57-0:57:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:56:57):**  in the sense of people are ready to give it a try, either for the first time or give it  
**[0:57:04-0:57:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:57:04):**  a try again.  
**[0:57:05-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:57:05):**  I was just in North Carolina the weekend before last speaking at the Mother Earth News Fair.  
**[0:57:10-0:57:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:57:10):**  And a woman there who was probably in her 60s, she said, I haven't made bread for 40  
**[0:57:14-0:57:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:57:14):**  years, but I really want to do it again.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:57:19):**  And I'm hearing a lot of that kind of thing.  
**[0:57:21-0:57:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:57:21):**  And it's so encouraging to me.  
**[0:57:22-0:57:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:57:22):**  I just think it's wonderful.  
**[0:57:23-0:57:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:57:23):**  Wow, yeah.  
**[0:57:24-0:57:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:57:24):**  And as we've been talking about, yeah, it's been, you know, bread is just so, it's so  
**[0:57:30-0:57:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:57:30):**  basic to so much of the world that, you know, it's, how is it that we've gotten to this  
**[0:57:34-0:57:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:57:34):**  point of being, you know, being scared of it?  
**[0:57:37-0:57:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:57:37):**  It's such a community food as well.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:57:39):**  So many regions around the world have their own versions.  
**[0:57:43-0:57:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:57:43):**  Often it really brings people together in a way that many other foods that I've seen  
**[0:57:48-0:57:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:57:48):**  in 13 years of travel just doesn't.  
**[0:57:51-0:57:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:57:51):**  Of all the skills that I've amassed and the things that I've learned how to do, the fact  
**[0:57:55-0:57:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:57:55):**  that I can go anywhere in the world and bake bread has definitely been the most popular  
**[0:57:59-0:58:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:57:59):**  one.  
**[0:58:00-0:58:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:58:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:58:01):**  Oh, I agree with you.  
**[0:58:02-0:58:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:58:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:58:03-0:58:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:58:03):**  And with all the different food trends out there, and I'm sure they're happening in other  
**[0:58:06-0:58:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:58:06):**  countries as well, you know, bread stays fairly constant.  
**[0:58:10-0:58:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:58:10):**  You know, people come up with different variations on that, of course.  
**[0:58:15-0:58:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:58:15):**  But I mean, I haven't traveled as extensively as you have, but I've been in France a few  
**[0:58:20-0:58:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:58:20):**  times and some other European countries.  
**[0:58:22-0:58:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:58:22):**  And you know, and really, like for instance in Paris, I mean, my gosh, you know, with  
**[0:58:30-0:58:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:58:30):**  all the different kinds of bread you can find at an artisan bakery in Paris, still the number  
**[0:58:34-0:58:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:58:34):**  one selling loaf is a basic baguette.  
**[0:58:36-0:58:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:58:36):**  Yeah, I can imagine.  
**[0:58:37-0:58:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:58:37):**  You know, it's a real simple basic thing.  
**[0:58:41-0:58:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:58:41):**  And there are still, you know, in a lot of the African countries and in the Eastern countries  
**[0:58:46-0:58:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:58:46):**  and you know, Pakistan and Afghanistan and India, you know, they still, an awful lot  
**[0:58:53-0:58:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:58:53):**  of their traditional breads there, you know, are simple flatbreads.  
**[0:58:59-0:59:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:58:59):**  And in India, I learned not all that long ago that, you know, an awful lot of people  
**[0:59:04-0:59:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:59:04):**  actually live off the grid in India when you get away from the big cities.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:59:08):**  And they cook things without electricity.  
**[0:59:10-0:59:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:59:10):**  I'm not that far from that myself where I am here in Guatemala.  
**[0:59:13-0:59:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:59:13):**  Oh, is that right?  
**[0:59:14-0:59:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:59:14):**  Yeah, we are on the grid, but there are quite a few communities around here that are quite  
**[0:59:18-0:59:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:59:18):**  disconnected and disconnected in kind of the modern sense, but still much more connected  
**[0:59:24-0:59:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:59:24):**  to their roots and their culture and their indigenous foods.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:59:27):**  So it's interesting to see those contrasts like you mentioned.  
**[0:59:30-0:59:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:59:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:59:31-0:59:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:59:31):**  And, you know, and since you're a natural builder, you know, too, and you work with  
**[0:59:34-0:59:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:59:34):**  cob as well as some other things, you know, actually I was wondering if you've ever built  
**[0:59:39-0:59:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:59:39):**  a cob oven, you know, where you are now or anywhere else, you know, because that's...  
**[0:59:45-0:59:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:59:45):**  I certainly have, yeah.  
**[0:59:47-0:59:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:59:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:59:48-0:59:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:59:48):**  And...  
**[0:59:49-0:59:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:59:49):**  I've been building those for years.  
**[0:59:50-0:59:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:59:50):**  I've done everything from barrel ovens, which we just last workshop that I taught.  
**[0:59:54-1:00:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=0:59:54):**  And I'm actually going to be building a very large earthen domed pizza oven for commercial  
**[1:00:00-1:00:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:00:00):**  use for a cafe in the next town over.  
**[1:00:02-1:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:00:02):**  So those types of things are kind of gaining in popularity again because of the quality  
**[1:00:07-1:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:00:07):**  of food that they crank out.  
**[1:00:08-1:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:00:08):**  That's amazing.  
**[1:00:10-1:00:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:00:10):**  Right.  
**[1:00:11-1:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:00:11):**  Yeah.  
**[1:00:12-1:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:00:12):**  And, you know, and I had this, you know, and as you know, I built my own wood-fired oven.  
**[1:00:16-1:00:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:00:16):**  I started it actually almost three years ago and I'm still, you know, I'm still in the  
**[1:00:21-1:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:00:21):**  process of putting layers of insulation over the dome, but I've been using it, you know,  
**[1:00:25-1:00:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:00:25):**  ever since the first layer of clay got finished over the dome, which was... in September it  
**[1:00:32-1:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:00:32):**  will be three years since that happened.  
**[1:00:34-1:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:00:34):**  And I've been using it ever since then.  
**[1:00:38-1:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:00:38):**  And I had this... and it's a fairly decent size.  
**[1:00:40-1:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:00:40):**  It's not huge, but you know, the inside of it, it's... the hearth is kind of oval shaped  
**[1:00:43-1:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:00:43):**  and it's about 42 inches from front to back and about 28 inches from side to side.  
**[1:00:51-1:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:00:51):**  And the inside of the dome is about 16 inches high.  
**[1:00:54-1:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:00:54):**  I've cooked whole turkeys in there.  
**[1:00:57-1:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:00:57):**  It's quite good sized and it's plenty big to do a lot of things.  
**[1:01:01-1:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:01:01):**  But I had this moment once where I was...  
**[1:01:04-1:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:01:04):**  I built this rack into the shelter that I built over the oven.  
**[1:01:10-1:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:01:10):**  I built a rack on the west side of that to hold my oven wood and I was stacking up wood  
**[1:01:14-1:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:01:14):**  there one day and I was kind of looking at the oven and I had this moment where it just  
**[1:01:18-1:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:01:18):**  occurred to me, you know what, this looks a lot like a tandoor oven laid on its side.  
**[1:01:23-1:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:01:23):**  It just kind of, you know, and so at that time, this was about a year and a half ago,  
**[1:01:28-1:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:01:28):**  at the time I was really...  
**[1:01:30-1:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:01:30):**  I love cooking of all kinds, but I was really getting seriously interested in Indian food.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:01:34):**  What a good fave.  
**[1:01:35-1:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:01:35):**  And so I ended up...  
**[1:01:36-1:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:01:36):**  Yeah, I ended up...  
**[1:01:37-1:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:01:37):**  I did some research about tandoor ovens and so I've used that oven to make tandoor chicken  
**[1:01:49-1:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:01:49):**  and some other things and roasted vegetables and of course naan.  
**[1:01:55-1:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:01:55):**  And it's just...  
**[1:01:56-1:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:01:56):**  I mean, you know, because you have more experience with these ovens than I do, but I've just  
**[1:02:02-1:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:02:02):**  been fascinated by the...I can't even describe the difference in flavor.  
**[1:02:06-1:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:02:06):**  There's something subtle about it that's not exactly smoky, it's just slightly different  
**[1:02:12-1:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:02:12):**  that just makes it, in my mind, just unique and incredibly delicious.  
**[1:02:16-1:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:02:16):**  Yeah, it's super rich.  
**[1:02:18-1:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:02:18):**  I can't wait to get the chance to try and build one of those myself.  
**[1:02:22-1:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:02:22):**  Yeah, it's really been fun and especially, you know, when we're getting into the warmer  
**[1:02:28-1:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:02:28):**  weather now, it's awfully nice to...when I want to bake bread, which I do pretty regularly,  
**[1:02:35-1:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:02:35):**  obviously, it's really nice to have the option of not having to use my inside oven and heating  
**[1:02:40-1:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:02:40):**  up the house on a hot day.  
**[1:02:41-1:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:02:41):**  Oh yeah, sure.  
**[1:02:43-1:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:02:43):**  Yeah, and also, you know, it might seem like a real little thing to most people, but I  
**[1:02:49-1:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:02:49):**  kind of feel like every time I use that outdoor oven, I'm using a little less gas or some  
**[1:02:54-1:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:02:54):**  other fossil fuel, and that to me is...it's just important in terms of our values and  
**[1:03:02-1:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:03:02):**  what we're trying to do with our lifestyle.  
**[1:03:04-1:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:03:04):**  And plus, since we heat our house with wood, and a lot of our 40 acres is woods, and we,  
**[1:03:10-1:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:03:10):**  you know, we cut down trees, and what I've been using for fuel in the wood-fired oven  
**[1:03:16-1:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:03:16):**  is the branches from those trees.  
**[1:03:18-1:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:03:18):**  And it works great because with their smaller diameter, you know, that just means that there's  
**[1:03:23-1:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:03:23):**  more surface area of the fuel that's exposed to air, and so it burns hot, and it burns  
**[1:03:28-1:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:03:28):**  fast, it heats up really fast, and that oven gets to about 900 degrees.  
**[1:03:35-1:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:03:35):**  And so...  
**[1:03:36-1:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:03:36):**  Yeah, I love that you mentioned that.  
**[1:03:37-1:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:03:37):**  I mean, that's one of the initiatives that we're trying to do here in our small community  
**[1:03:39-1:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:03:39):**  because deforestation is such a problem, that smaller diameter wood can very regeneratively  
**[1:03:45-1:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:03:45):**  be pollarded off of trees without having to cut them down entirely.  
**[1:03:50-1:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:03:50):**  And if it's managed in that way, you know, it does a lot to help fight deforestation.  
**[1:03:57-1:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:03:57):**  And like you said, you get a really hot, very clean burn off those small diameter, dry sticks  
**[1:04:05-1:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:04:05):**  and poles and things like that, which are fantastic for the types of rocket stoves and  
**[1:04:09-1:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:04:09):**  ovens that we build around here.  
**[1:04:11-1:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:04:11):**  Right.  
**[1:04:12-1:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:04:12):**  And, you know, and of course, David is thrilled that I'm using these branches partly because  
**[1:04:16-1:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:04:16):**  I'm doing all the work of cutting them up and hauling them and everything, but also  
**[1:04:19-1:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:04:19):**  because, well, a couple of reasons, one of which is I'm not raiding the wood shed and  
**[1:04:24-1:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:04:24):**  using the wood that we use for heating the house.  
**[1:04:26-1:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:04:26):**  I'm not using that for fuel.  
**[1:04:28-1:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:04:28):**  And also, when we're out in the woods, you know, a couple hundred yards from the house,  
**[1:04:34-1:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:04:34):**  you know, and we cut all these branches off of the trees that we're going to use for wood  
**[1:04:39-1:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:04:39):**  heat, that stuff piles up in the woods and it can become a fire hazard.  
**[1:04:42-1:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:04:42):**  Certainly.  
**[1:04:43-1:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:04:43):**  But, you know, we like to leave...  
**[1:04:46-1:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:04:46):**  There's a couple of strategic locations that we have figured out where we like to leave  
**[1:04:51-1:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:04:51):**  a relatively small pile of that kind of thing for habitat for small animals.  
**[1:04:57-1:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:04:57):**  There's...  
**[1:04:58-1:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:04:58):**  I didn't even know until we moved out there how many small birds nest very close to the  
**[1:05:02-1:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:05:02):**  ground.  
**[1:05:03-1:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:05:03):**  And so we do like, in certain places where it's not so much of a potential fire hazard,  
**[1:05:10-1:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:05:10):**  you know, like close to the pond or something like that, you know, we will leave some piles  
**[1:05:14-1:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:05:14):**  of branches there, you know, for habitat for small birds and some small mammals as well.  
**[1:05:20-1:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:05:20):**  But in general, you know, we like to clear that out of the woods.  
**[1:05:23-1:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:05:23):**  And so David is just...  
**[1:05:25-1:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:05:25):**  He's so happy about this that we're, you know, we're not creating a fire hazard and we're  
**[1:05:29-1:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:05:29):**  not wasting anything, you know, but those branches are not going to waste.  
**[1:05:33-1:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:05:33):**  You're creating habitat, you're cleaning up the underbrush and it makes your bread.  
**[1:05:37-1:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:05:37):**  Everybody wins there.  
**[1:05:38-1:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:05:38):**  That's fantastic.  
**[1:05:39-1:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:05:39):**  Exactly.  
**[1:05:40-1:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:05:40):**  Exactly.  
**[1:05:41-1:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:05:41):**  So as far as I'm concerned, it's a win-win situation.  
**[1:05:43-1:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:05:43):**  Yes, it's pretty labor-intensive processing all the branches and making them into oven  
**[1:05:48-1:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:05:48):**  wood and hauling them down and stacking them.  
**[1:05:51-1:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:05:51):**  But in my view, it's really worth it.  
**[1:05:55-1:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:05:55):**  And so that's...  
**[1:05:56-1:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:05:56):**  Yeah, and then you don't have to pay for a gym membership either.  
**[1:05:58-1:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:05:58):**  Well, that's very true too.  
**[1:06:00-1:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:06:00):**  Yeah, we get plenty of exercise at our place.  
**[1:06:02-1:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:06:02):**  That's, yeah, that's for sure.  
**[1:06:04-1:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:06:04):**  Yeah.  
**[1:06:05-1:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:06:05):**  And so, and that part, I didn't even know any of that.  
**[1:06:08-1:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:06:08):**  I didn't even know what I was going to be using for fuel before I built that oven.  
**[1:06:12-1:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:06:12):**  And so that's just been kind of this nice surprise that's come along as part of the  
**[1:06:15-1:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:06:15):**  process of learning how to use it.  
**[1:06:18-1:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:06:18):**  And like I said, David is just, you know, he's so happy about it that, you know, I'm  
**[1:06:23-1:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:06:23):**  kind of taking care of all the branches and, you know, and we're kind of keeping our environment  
**[1:06:29-1:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:06:29):**  a little safer in terms of fire danger.  
**[1:06:31-1:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:06:31):**  And, you know, and, you know, it's like free fuel pretty much.  
**[1:06:36-1:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:06:36):**  All I have to do is put some time and effort into it.  
**[1:06:38-1:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:06:38):**  And so, and as you said, the...  
**[1:06:40-1:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:06:40):**  That is wonderful.  
**[1:06:41-1:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:06:41):**  As you said, the results in this oven are just, it's just so amazing.  
**[1:06:45-1:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:06:45):**  It's, you know, I, the hardest part about that whole thing is, you know, was trying  
**[1:06:51-1:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:06:51):**  to figure out, you know, how to kind of manage the temperature in there and, you know, when  
**[1:06:56-1:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:06:56):**  to put the bread in and that sort of thing so that it would cook but wouldn't burn.  
**[1:07:00-1:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:07:00):**  And, you know, but when I built it, I had actually embedded thermocouples in three different  
**[1:07:05-1:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:07:05):**  places there.  
**[1:07:06-1:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:07:06):**  And one of them, I drilled a hole into one of the hearth bricks and cemented a thermocouple  
**[1:07:11-1:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:07:11):**  in there and one's at the top of the dome and one's at the back of the dome.  
**[1:07:15-1:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:07:15):**  And they're connected to a thermometer.  
**[1:07:17-1:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:07:17):**  So when you turn on the thermometer, you can see in real time all three temperatures in  
**[1:07:22-1:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:07:22):**  those places and that's helped a lot.  
**[1:07:23-1:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:07:23):**  Oh yeah, that's the way to go.  
**[1:07:25-1:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:07:25):**  Yeah, that's helped a lot.  
**[1:07:26-1:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:07:26):**  Certainly.  
**[1:07:27-1:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:07:27):**  Yeah.  
**[1:07:28-1:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:07:28):**  The one thing I don't really know is what the air temperature is inside the oven.  
**[1:07:33-1:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:07:33):**  You know, I can only pretty much, you know, I, I've put a thermometer in there a couple  
**[1:07:37-1:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:07:37):**  of times but then I've been a little scared to do that because it's so darn hot in there.  
**[1:07:41-1:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:07:41):**  And especially when the air gets moving through there and you get that convection action going,  
**[1:07:46-1:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:07:46):**  it's just, it's incredibly hot.  
**[1:07:48-1:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:07:48):**  And I'm kind of afraid of melting my thermometer or something.  
**[1:07:51-1:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:07:51):**  And so, so I've just kind of had to learn by experience that, you know, like for instance  
**[1:07:56-1:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:07:56):**  with my loaf bread, with sourdough bread, I watched the hearth temperature.  
**[1:08:01-1:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:08:01):**  And as soon as I see that the hearth temperature is just starting to drop, perfect time to  
**[1:08:06-1:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:08:06):**  put my loaf bread in there.  
**[1:08:08-1:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:08:08):**  Cooks perfectly every single time, really consistently and, you know, without burning.  
**[1:08:12-1:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:08:12):**  And so I've had to learn stuff like that.  
**[1:08:14-1:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:08:14):**  I've had my share of failures with that.  
**[1:08:18-1:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:08:18):**  But you know, I'm probably going to be on a learning curve for quite some time I would  
**[1:08:22-1:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:08:22):**  guess with that thing.  
**[1:08:23-1:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:08:23):**  But, but I tell you what, it's been well worth the investment in time and effort and I've  
**[1:08:27-1:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:08:27):**  learned a lot and I don't know if I'll ever build another oven again but hey, if anybody  
**[1:08:32-1:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:08:32):**  asked me to come help them with it, I'd love to do that.  
**[1:08:35-1:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:08:35):**  But it was a really neat project and I'm really loving the results that we get baking in that  
**[1:08:41-1:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:08:41):**  thing or cooking other things as well.  
**[1:08:43-1:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:08:43):**  Well hey, I'll definitely give you a call when I'm building the next oven.  
**[1:08:46-1:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:08:46):**  You can come and help us out over here.  
**[1:08:48-1:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:08:48):**  Oh man, I would so love to come to Guatemala.  
**[1:08:51-1:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:08:51):**  I've only ever even been to Mexico once and never been anywhere else in Central America.  
**[1:08:55-1:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:08:55):**  And I would just, I would dearly love to do that.  
**[1:08:58-1:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:08:58):**  Oh man, there's so many fun projects going on here.  
**[1:09:01-1:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:09:01):**  I'll definitely keep you in the loop and we'll stay in touch.  
**[1:09:04-1:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:09:04):**  But hey, before I let you go here.  
**[1:09:05-1:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:09:05):**  Oh that would be great.  
**[1:09:06-1:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:09:06):**  Could you let our listeners know how they can get in touch with you, where they can  
**[1:09:10-1:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:09:10):**  buy the book and any other resources or links that you would send them to to learn more?  
**[1:09:15-1:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:09:15):**  Okay, sure.  
**[1:09:16-1:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:09:16):**  Yeah, my book is called From No Need to Sourdough and the subtitle is A Simpler Approach to  
**[1:09:20-1:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:09:20):**  Handmade Bread.  
**[1:09:23-1:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:09:23):**  And that is still available for pre-order.  
**[1:09:25-1:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:09:25):**  The official publish date is June 19th, but it's available right now for pre-order all  
**[1:09:31-1:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:09:31):**  of the usual places online.  
**[1:09:33-1:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:09:33):**  You can order it directly from my publisher, which is New Society Publishers, and that's  
**[1:09:37-1:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:09:37):**  newsociety.com.  
**[1:09:41-1:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:09:41):**  And if you pre-order directly from the publisher, they're offering a 20% discount if you pre-order  
**[1:09:47-1:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:09:47):**  it before the official publish date.  
**[1:09:49-1:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:09:49):**  You can also order it of course on Amazon or Barnes and Noble, places like that.  
**[1:09:56-1:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:09:56):**  To get a hold of me, my website is, I'll probably need to spell it out for you, it's my name,  
**[1:10:02-1:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:10:02):**  Victoria Redhead Miller dot com.  
**[1:10:07-1:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:10:07):**  And I'll just spell that out, Victoria is V-I-C-T-O-R-I-A, Redhead does not have an  
**[1:10:15-1:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:10:15):**  A in it, it's R-E-D-H-E-D, and then Miller, M-I-L-L-E-R, Victoria Redhead Miller dot com.  
**[1:10:27-1:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:10:27):**  And if you go there and click on the tab that says contact, it will take you to a contact  
**[1:10:32-1:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:10:32):**  form that goes directly to my email.  
**[1:10:34-1:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:10:34):**  And that's probably the easiest way to get a hold of me, you can easily find me under  
**[1:10:38-1:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:10:38):**  my full name, Victoria Redhead Miller on Facebook.  
**[1:10:43-1:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:10:43):**  I have a Twitter account, which is offgridwriter, O-F-F-G-R-I-D-W-R-I-T-E-R, but I have to say  
**[1:10:57-1:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:10:57):**  I am not on Twitter all that often, we are off the grid and we don't have internet at  
**[1:11:01-1:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:11:01):**  home.  
**[1:11:02-1:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:11:02):**  I'm on Facebook more frequently than on Twitter.  
**[1:11:08-1:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:11:08):**  So those are probably the easiest ways to get a hold of me.  
**[1:11:12-1:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:11:12):**  And you can also, if you're anywhere in the area, I'm going the first weekend of June,  
**[1:11:17-1:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:11:17):**  I will be at the Mother Earth News Fair in Frederick, Maryland, and we should have advance  
**[1:11:22-1:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:11:22):**  copies of the book there.  
**[1:11:24-1:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:11:24):**  So if you're anywhere in that area and you want to come to the fair, I'd be happy to  
**[1:11:28-1:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:11:28):**  sign a book and answer questions, that sort of thing.  
**[1:11:32-1:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:11:32):**  And I'll also be at the rest of the Mother Earth News Fairs this year, all six of them.  
**[1:11:37-1:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:11:37):**  And so you can look on that website, motherearthnewsfair.com, to find out the schedule of those events, albeit  
**[1:11:45-1:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:11:45):**  all of those.  
**[1:11:48-1:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:11:48):**  And I'm always happy to answer questions if people want to contact me through my contact  
**[1:11:54-1:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:11:54):**  form on my website or send me a friend request on Facebook.  
**[1:12:01-1:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:12:01):**  I'm always happy to answer questions when I have time to.  
**[1:12:03-1:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:12:03):**  Excellent.  
**[1:12:04-1:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:12:04):**  I'll make sure that I put all of those links on the show notes for this episode.  
**[1:12:08-1:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:12:08):**  And I also just want to say for the listeners out there that this is a really valuable book.  
**[1:12:11-1:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:12:11):**  I mean, I'm no novice to bread making myself and I got tons out of it, but there's also  
**[1:12:17-1:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:12:17):**  very easy to follow instructions and advice for novices as well.  
**[1:12:21-1:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:12:21):**  So really anyone at any skill level will get a lot out of this.  
**[1:12:25-1:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:12:25):**  Thank you again so much for your time, Victoria.  
**[1:12:27-1:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:12:27):**  It's been such a pleasure talking to you today and let's stay in touch.  
**[1:12:30-1:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:12:30):**  Hopefully we can do a follow up sometime.  
**[1:12:32-1:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-victoria-miller/#t=1:12:32):**  Oh, I'd love to Oliver.

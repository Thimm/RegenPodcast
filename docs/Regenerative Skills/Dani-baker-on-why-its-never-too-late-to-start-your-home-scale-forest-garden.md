**[0:04:24-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:04:24):**  And now I'll hand things over to Dani Baker.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:04:27):**  Dani, you have a really interesting story about how you got started farming in the first  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:04:33):**  place, but also how you ended up in the little island.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:04:38):**  What first inspired you to get into forest gardening specifically?  
**[0:04:43-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:04:43):**  Well, we started, I was about to retire from a job as a psychologist, and I was freaking  
**[0:04:50-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:04:50):**  out about what I was going to do with all my idle time.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:04:53):**  So we bought 100 acres on Wellesley Island, which is an interstate accessed island in  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:04:57):**  the middle of the St. Lawrence River, you're in New York State.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:05:02):**  Just literally a stone's throw from Canada.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:05:05):**  And so we started farming.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:05:07):**  I was a vegetable lady, my partner was the animal guy.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:05:12):**  And seven years into it, I always like to broaden my knowledge of agriculture.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:05:20):**  So there was a course offered at the local cooperative extension on permaculture.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:05:26):**  And I'd never heard the word before.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:05:29):**  I didn't know what it was, but I said, I'm going to see what this is about.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:05:32):**  So I went to it, and it talked all about planting a garden that basically emulates nature, specifically  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:05:41):**  a forest edge.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:05:43):**  And you build in all the plants that provide all the nutrients and the pest protection  
**[0:05:49-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:05:49):**  and attract all the pollinators and the beneficial insects for your food producing plants.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:05:57):**  So your labor in terms of adding amendments over time is essentially nil.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:06:04):**  And it was like a revelation to me.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:06:06):**  It just made so much sense to do that.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:06:10):**  And so before it was a two hour class, before it was over, I decided I was going to plant  
**[0:06:16-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:06:16):**  an edible forest garden.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:06:17):**  And I came home, I told my partner, Dave, I need a fence because we have huge deer pressure  
**[0:06:22-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:06:22):**  here on the island.

**[0:06:25-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:06:25):**  You can't let them eat all your seedlings, but you'll never have anything broke.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:06:28):**  So we found half an acre that wasn't part of his pasture.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:06:34):**  And he fenced it in with a nice heavy duty fence with electric wires, and we baited it

**[0:06:43-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:06:43):**  And that was my plot.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:06:45):**  And so I thought I was going to be able to plant right away.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:06:49):**  This was March.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:06:50):**  I thought I was going to be able to plant that year.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:06:53):**  But as I looked into the subject matter more, I realized there was a good deal of planning  
**[0:06:57-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:06:57):**  that needed to be done and land prep before I was ready to plant.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:07:01):**  So I realized I'd have to wait a year till the next spring to do my planting.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:07:06):**  But meanwhile, I started studying my land and envisioning the garden, the eventual garden,

**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:08:11):**  Steph Holzer out of Austria has a wonderful permaculture farm there.

**[0:10:11-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:10:11):**  you know, phone lines above whatever these needs to be noted.

**[0:10:25-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:10:25):**  I use one square equal one foot.

**[0:10:29-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:10:29):**  So I needed to take together about eight different pieces of graph paper to do it.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:10:33):**  So then I did a two scale drawing by actually going back and forth from my paper map to  
**[0:10:40-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:10:40):**  the land measuring back and forth to make sure I was accurate.

**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:10:51):**  Now we have a farm, so I kind of wanted to make the garden a public place.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:10:57):**  So I decided I needed to have a big, a large gathering area.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:11:03):**  And I needed to make the entry and that gathering area very solid because what if, what if we

**[0:11:50-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:11:50):**  So I had all the six inch thick giant slab.

**[0:12:09-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:12:09):**  And then I wanted to, I wanted to push the envelope on my hardiness.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:12:15):**  So I wanted to try some plants, some trees and bushes and ground covers that are not

**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:13:20):**  So I'm very excited about those.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:13:23):**  And that's remarkable.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:13:24):**  You really did do your research and it's fascinating to hear how many of those different elements  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:13:29):**  from the landscape, as well as what you desire to get out of it and your consideration of  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:13:34):**  everything from energy flows to different uses and access out into the future, are the  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:13:39):**  things that informed what you have been, I would imagine, tweaking and adjusting ever  
**[0:13:43-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:13:43):**  since that point.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:13:45):**  Yes.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:13:46):**  And you also mentioned in your book that you have had some very difficult soil to work  
**[0:13:52-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:13:52):**  with on the island where you are.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:13:53):**  Could you describe some of those challenges and what you did to overcome them?  
**[0:13:57-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:13:57):**  Well, a couple of features of my soil.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:14:00):**  My soil is primarily very heavy clay.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:14:04):**  And when I say heavy clay, before I started to amend it, if I stuck a shovel in the ground,  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:14:10):**  a big cloud of clay would come up on the shovel like you could throw, you could make a pot  
**[0:14:15-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:14:15):**  out of.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:14:16):**  You could use it for pottery.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:14:17):**  That's how dense and compacted it was.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:14:21):**  So I knew I had to do something about that.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:14:23):**  So that first year while I was studying my ground, I frost seeded it with three different  
**[0:14:29-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:14:29):**  kinds of clover.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:14:30):**  Some leftover seed.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:14:31):**  And I know that clover not only does it fix nitrogen, which the soil probably could benefit  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:14:37):**  from in the plants that I was going to plant, but also it has very deep tap roots and it  
**[0:14:42-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:14:42):**  breaks up clay and it actually can get down to the subsoil and start breaking that up  
**[0:14:48-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:14:48):**  as well.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:14:49):**  So I did plant the second year.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:14:51):**  So that spring, I took the course in March and then the following spring was when I did  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:14:58):**  the frost seeding of the clover and I started to plant some trees.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:15:02):**  And when I dug the holes for those trees, as I mentioned, the dirt came out in these  
**[0:15:08-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:15:08):**  huge clods.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:15:10):**  But the next year when I planted trees, it was already broken up into half an inch or  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:15:15):**  one inch pieces.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:15:17):**  So the clover had done this wonderful job.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:15:20):**  Not only did I use that as a cover crop initially, but I also used copious quantities of wood  
**[0:15:26-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:15:26):**  chips and leaves and some partially composted yard waste that I got from a summer colony  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:15:33):**  down the road and just kept adding this on the surface.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:15:37):**  There's no need to till it in.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:15:39):**  The soil life will take care of it as long as it has contact with the soil and eventually  
**[0:15:44-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:15:44):**  pull it back down into the soil and add the organic matter to the soil to again aerate  
**[0:15:50-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:15:50):**  it and make it drain better.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:15:53):**  That's the drainage is a huge problem with heavy clay.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:15:55):**  The other thing I had that was problematic was some areas.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:16:02):**  After three years, it wasn't enough to have half an acre to manage.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:16:04):**  I decided to expand it another half acre.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:16:07):**  And then that half acre, about a third of it is sod and ground with a water table that's  
**[0:16:12-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:16:12):**  above the surface for a good part of the year.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:16:15):**  So that was another challenge that I needed to face.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:16:18):**  And I've dealt with that in a number of ways.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:16:20):**  I've made small raised beds.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:16:23):**  I've tried to sheet mulch repeatedly to raise the soil level.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:16:26):**  And I also, the most successful way of dealing with it, I believe is I've been building hukil  
**[0:16:34-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:16:34):**  culture mounds that raise the planting area above the groundwater.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:16:40):**  And those have worked really well so far for me.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:16:43):**  I've also chosen plants, which can be very challenging, that can tolerate saturated soil.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:16:49):**  But in my trial and error experimentation, I found some that do super well, like high  
**[0:16:54-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:16:54):**  bush cranberries.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:16:55):**  Love it.  
**[0:16:57-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:16:57):**  And they're productive or fruit.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:16:58):**  They're beautiful in four seasons.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:17:00):**  That's one thing I emphasize in the book and in my own landscaping.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:17:05):**  I really appreciate plants that give you four seasons of beauty.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:17:11):**  So that's one because they hold their berries all winter.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:17:15):**  In addition to having lovely flowers in the spring and ripening berries through the summer  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:17:20):**  and then lovely leaf color in the fall.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:17:24):**  That's such a perfect example.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:17:25):**  I love the use of cranberries there because they are originally a wetland or a bog plant,  
**[0:17:30-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:17:30):**  aren't they?  
**[0:17:31-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:17:31):**  And they like that.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:17:32):**  Well, these are actually, this is not a true cranberry.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:17:35):**  The cranberries you're familiar with grow, they're vines on the ground that grow in logs.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:17:40):**  These are actually in the verbenum family.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:17:44):**  They're bushes, they're 10 foot by 10 foot.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:17:48):**  And they have a cranberry light berry that you can use in the same way as you use cranberries.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:17:53):**  Oh, it's actually a different species.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:17:54):**  It is totally different.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:17:56):**  And I'd never heard of it before I started reading these books.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:17:59):**  And it said, likes it wet.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:18:01):**  Okay, I'm going to try.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:18:03):**  Oh, that's perfect.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:18:04):**  I'm just like you.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:18:05):**  I get such a kick about finding new plants, especially ones that do well in the specific  
**[0:18:09-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:18:09):**  niches of your land.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:18:11):**  And let's continue to go deeper into that because you talked about some of the limitations  
**[0:18:16-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:18:16):**  of growing in zone four.

**[0:18:22-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:18:22):**  a zone eight pretty soon.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:18:24):**  I grew up in a zone four in Minnesota.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:18:27):**  And I remember quite a bit from that environment.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:18:30):**  What have been some of the biggest challenges in selecting plants and finding ways of cultivating  
**[0:18:37-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:18:37):**  things there?

**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:18:44):**  Well the first thing that comes to mind offhand is in some of the plants that I've chosen

**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:19:02):**  So as long as I have snow cover, and if it's a grafted plant and the graft is below the

**[0:19:27-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:19:27):**  But if I have a more temperate winter in between, they flower the second year.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:19:33):**  So they've grown back from above the graft, and then if I don't have a really bad winter  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:19:38):**  the next winter, they've flowered and fruited.

**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:19:54):**  This year we had a pretty harsh, we had a zone seven winter two winters ago.

**[0:20:42-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:20:42):**  those are just some examples of some of the problems.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:20:45):**  Now there's another problem I've had with sweet cherries, another borderline plant.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:20:50):**  One season we had a very temperate fall that lasted till mid-January, and then it went

**[0:21:02-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:21:02):**  Well, stone fruits like peaches and sweet cherries, they harden off, they get ready  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:21:09):**  for the winter from the smallest branches first, and they gradually work their way down  
**[0:21:15-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:21:15):**  to the trunks.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:21:16):**  Well, I don't think some of my cherries had time to do that because it was such a sudden  
**[0:21:20-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:21:20):**  change and I had my largest sweet cherries, three of them were goners.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:21:27):**  The younger ones probably had more time to get down to their trunks and they survived.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:21:32):**  So that's just another example.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:21:36):**  Some of the benefits though are things like tamarack.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:21:39):**  Tamarack trees are found in the far north and they're only viable to zone six.

**[0:22:04-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:22:04):**  It's a conifer that loses its needles in the fall.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:22:08):**  They turn golden yellow and they fall off.

**[0:22:20-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:22:20):**  It grows quite tall.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:22:21):**  It grows very rapidly.

**[0:22:24-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:22:24):**  It's actually a tree found in bogs and because it's used to being around water, the trunks  
**[0:22:34-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:22:34):**  are very rot resistant.

**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:22:43):**  lay them on the ground to make a solid surface where it's wet.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:22:47):**  And it's just a beautiful tree.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:22:49):**  I mean, I think it's when the needles come out in the spring, they're a pale green and  
**[0:22:53-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:22:53):**  they're coming out right now and it's just so delightful to look at.

**[0:23:18-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:23:18):**  need a cold winter in order to be viable like rhubarb and you get a little too warm and  
**[0:23:25-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:23:25):**  they just won't grow for you because they don't have the cold winters.

**[0:23:38-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:23:38):**  I want to make sure.

**[0:23:48-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:23:48):**  flavor.

**[0:25:02-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:25:02):**  in your unique context.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:25:06):**  Well, this is a work in progress in process.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:25:13):**  I only have a few positive conclusions I could share at the moment because I've never done

**[0:25:27-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:25:27):**  You put things together you think are going to get along and then you discover they don't.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:25:34):**  But it takes time.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:25:35):**  These are perennials.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:25:36):**  You may not realize in the first or second year that you have an issue, but by the third  
**[0:25:40-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:25:40):**  year now one is overrun the other and now you have to kind of either accept that or  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:25:45):**  start again or do something.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:25:47):**  So there are a number of plants that have done well.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:25:51):**  And I guess we're talking herbaceous and ground covers, which is my biggest challenge.  
**[0:25:56-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:25:56):**  I had least familiarity with those.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:25:59):**  In terms of woody plants, I've had a lot of luck.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:26:04):**  So I've tried, I have about 25 different nitrogen fixing plants growing in my garden.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:26:09):**  Many of them are woody.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:26:12):**  They've done very well.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:26:13):**  I really haven't had major issues unless they were just not appropriate for my zone.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:26:20):**  Even something like licorice, which by the way is a nitrogen fixer, it's a legume.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:26:26):**  I started them from seed.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:26:29):**  The catalog said they were only good for zone six, but they've come up every year.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:26:33):**  In my garden.

**[0:26:38-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:26:38):**  So the nitrogen fixers, I've been good.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:26:41):**  Now there's basically four categories of supportive plants.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:26:45):**  Nitrogen fixers, beneficial attractors.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:26:48):**  So these are flowering plants that not only attract pollinators, but attract insects that  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:26:53):**  are going to take care of your other, your pest insects.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:26:56):**  So there's such a huge variety of those.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:27:00):**  I really haven't had a problem providing them.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:27:03):**  Not only do the fruit and berry bushes flower, but lots of perennial vegetables flower, other  
**[0:27:10-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:27:10):**  kinds of edibles, strawberries.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:27:12):**  These are all things that flower.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:27:14):**  So I don't even, you know, it's said that you want to have something flowering from  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:27:18):**  as early in the season to as late in the season so you can feed your pollinators and your

**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:27:24):**  I never tried to plant things to make sure I covered every week.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:27:28):**  I just planted everything.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:27:29):**  I have over 300 different things in my garden.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:27:32):**  I just planted stuff and I haven't really noticed a time of year when nothing's flowering.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:27:38):**  Even in a time of drought, I have something called bird foot tree foil.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:27:42):**  It's actually not native, but has naturalized all over here.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:27:46):**  It's a legume and it flowers.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:27:48):**  It's very drought tolerant.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:27:49):**  So when nothing else is flowering, because it's too dry, it's flowering in the cracks  
**[0:27:52-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:27:52):**  between my rocks.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:27:53):**  Amazing.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:27:54):**  Yeah, I have something all the time.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:27:57):**  And then nutrient accumulators.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:28:01):**  So these are plants that have deep top roots that concentrate in their roots.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:28:05):**  These are one or more important nutrients that when those leaves die off in the fall  
**[0:28:13-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:28:13):**  and start to decay, those nutrients become available to the other plants around.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:28:19):**  And dandelions are an example.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:28:23):**  I used to hate them, but now I'm coming to love them.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:28:27):**  Comfrey is the nutrient accumulator, what I call par excellence.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:28:31):**  It's a large plant.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:28:34):**  It produces copious amounts of organic matter.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:28:37):**  You can cut and drop those long stems and leaves around plants that you think might  
**[0:28:41-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:28:41):**  need a little more potassium or phosphorus.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:28:44):**  It accumulates six different nutrients and leaves.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:28:47):**  It also has flowers that attract beneficials.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:28:50):**  It also is very useful medicinally to heal wounds and bones, and you can make a sap out  
**[0:28:58-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:28:58):**  of it, you can make a compress out of it.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:29:01):**  It's good nutrition for animals.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:29:04):**  It just has multiple uses.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:29:08):**  And it's very hard.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:29:10):**  And you can't kill it once you plant it.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:29:11):**  So I waited four years before I decided to put comfrey in my garden, because I knew I  
**[0:29:17-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:29:17):**  wouldn't be able to get rid of it once I put it in the right spot, so it wouldn't be a

**[0:29:25-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:29:25):**  So that's an example of a nutrient accumulator.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:29:28):**  And then there's a category called aromatic pest confusers.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:29:33):**  Now I'm not sure there's a lot of research supporting this, but it's thought that aromatic  
**[0:29:40-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:29:40):**  herbs and plants of the onion family that give off pretty strong scents will confuse  
**[0:29:48-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:29:48):**  pest insects that may be coming in and looking for a specific host plant, and then they encounter,  
**[0:29:55-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:29:55):**  let's say, a mass of oregano.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:29:58):**  And now with that odor, now what happened to the plant?  
**[0:30:03-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:30:03):**  The other thing is too that these herbs like lavender, oregano, they sublimate oils that  
**[0:30:11-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:30:11):**  actually have antifungal.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:30:13):**  This is why they're used medicinally by people for one of the reasons.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:30:16):**  So that's another benefit of those kinds of plants to scatter them around your garden,  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:30:21):**  because they may be providing a little protection against fungal disease.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:30:26):**  So I've just trial and error.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:30:29):**  I've tried everything that I thought I could grow, and I might try it two or three times  
**[0:30:36-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:30:36):**  before I accept the fact that I can't grow it, or the first time and from then on it's  
**[0:30:40-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:30:40):**  working for me.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:30:43):**  But I do find it challenging to combine plants together and have some longevity of the combination.  
**[0:30:53-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:30:53):**  I have some successful combinations, and then I have others that are still kind of evolving.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:31:00):**  That's one of the beauties of a perennial planting.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:31:03):**  You plant an annual garden, you till it up every year, you plant everything, you cultivate  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:31:07):**  your weeds, you water, you do all that, and then at the end of the season, it's annual,  
**[0:31:12-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:31:12):**  everything dies, you start again.

**[0:33:50-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:33:50):**  Well, in my book, actually, I have in the appendix, I have a section where I talk about

**[0:34:03-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:34:03):**  So right now, well, starting in the winter, there's not a whole lot of work in the winter,  
**[0:34:12-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:34:12):**  but we need to check to make sure the deer aren't getting in.

**[0:35:03-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:35:03):**  need to make sure the snow hasn't overcome above the top edge of that.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:35:08):**  Because if it does, then the rodents can get to the bark through the snow.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:35:12):**  So I just go out, like if we have a big snow, which is maybe a couple of times a season  
**[0:35:17-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:35:17):**  and clear the snow from inside and outside.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:35:20):**  That just so the metal is showing above it that way, I'm good.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:35:25):**  In late winter, it's time to prune.

**[0:35:32-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:35:32):**  Some of the natives don't require it, but I find even with the honey berries, which

**[0:37:01-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:37:01):**  a bed that's been infested.

**[0:37:29-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:37:29):**  So I've been doing a lot of that this year.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:37:30):**  The reason it got away from me was because I was editing the book last summer.

**[0:37:39-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:37:39):**  But it's okay.

**[0:37:52-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:37:52):**  I mean, the initial planting is pretty major, depending on how large a plot you're planting.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:37:58):**  But once it's established, it's just a matter of, oh, there's a little space here.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:38:05):**  I think I'll put something here.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:38:07):**  Or this bush is a little crowded.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:38:09):**  I think I need to move it to another spot where it might be happier.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:38:13):**  And if things die, you might choose to replace them with something else.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:38:17):**  Did I answer your question?  
**[0:38:19-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:38:19):**  I don't think I answered your question.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:38:20):**  Yeah, yeah, for sure.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:38:21):**  But what do you do about perhaps infestations or insects or disease?  
**[0:38:26-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:38:26):**  Does that come up?  
**[0:38:29-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:38:29):**  Well, pest disease.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:38:31):**  I have issues with a pest called plum curculio, which I haven't been able to address.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:38:40):**  I haven't figured out how to address it yet.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:38:42):**  Because the lifecycle of this insect is, it flies in from the woods.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:38:46):**  We have a lot of woods around us.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:38:49):**  It infests all the fruits of the plum and plum fruit family, rather the stone fruit  
**[0:38:56-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:38:56):**  and plum fruit family.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:38:58):**  In my case, especially my plums and my Asian pears.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:39:02):**  So it enters those young fruits.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:39:07):**  And then those fruits fall to the ground.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:39:10):**  And the larvae go into the ground.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:39:13):**  They go through their cycles.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:39:15):**  And then they come out in August, and they fly back to the woods.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:39:19):**  So I've tried a number of things to try to deal with them.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:39:26):**  Nothing's really worked so far.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:39:27):**  But then see the lifecycle isn't contained in the garden.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:39:30):**  So as long as they're coming in from the woods, I'm not sure.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:39:33):**  I'm hoping that at some point, things will balance out and they'll only infest my fruit  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:39:39):**  trees enough to basically fin them for me.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:39:44):**  I'm hoping that'll happen someday.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:39:45):**  But at this moment, I don't have much of a plum harvest because they're pretty much all  
**[0:39:51-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:39:51):**  taken out by that pest.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:39:52):**  And then my Asian pears, I might, well Asian pears are very productive of fruit.  
**[0:39:57-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:39:57):**  They have to be thinned anyway.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:39:58):**  But I might get six that haven't been infested out of literally hundreds on a tree.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:40:03):**  But I'm happy with the six.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:40:05):**  I'm thrilled.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:40:06):**  Okay, so that's one issue I haven't been able to deal with.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:40:10):**  However, things like caterpillars and insect pests, I've been quite successful with those  
**[0:40:17-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:40:17):**  because I put birdhouses all around my garden.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:40:20):**  And so birds love to eat bugs.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:40:23):**  And I learned from Stefan, I can't pronounce his last name.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:40:27):**  Yes.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:40:28):**  Some kowiak.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:40:29):**  Yes, thank you so much.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:40:30):**  He's got a five acre permaculture orchard in Southern Quebec in Canada.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:40:37):**  And I visited his farm and he has birdhouses everywhere.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:40:41):**  And he says, if he sees a caterpillar nest on a branch, he doesn't do anything.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:40:47):**  And the birds will eat them before those caterpillars move to another branch.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:40:51):**  So before I had issues with caterpillars, before I installed birdhouses, but once I  
**[0:40:57-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:40:57):**  saw that and I thought, I got to try this.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:41:00):**  Now I do just what he does.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:41:02):**  If I see a caterpillar nest, I leave it alone.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:41:06):**  And before you know it, the birds have eaten all the caterpillars and it doesn't move to  
**[0:41:10-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:41:10):**  another branch.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:41:12):**  And so the caterpillars eat a few leaves.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:41:15):**  The plants are so resilient, they can take that.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:41:18):**  They can't take, they don't like being stripped entirely.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:41:22):**  But so that's worked with that.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:41:23):**  And I'm sure with other insect pests, I also have intentionally planted and also discovered  
**[0:41:31-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:41:31):**  some trap crops in my garden.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:41:33):**  So a trap crop is a plant that attracts bugs away from the plants that you don't want them  
**[0:41:37-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:41:37):**  to mess with.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:41:38):**  So for example, for aphids, I noticed that blue lupin and also hairy vetch are trap crops  
**[0:41:47-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:41:47):**  for aphids.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:41:48):**  They congregate on the stems of these plants and they're never on my other plants.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:41:53):**  I first noticed this in my annual vegetable garden.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:41:55):**  They were never on my kale, but they were always on the hairy vetch.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:41:58):**  And then things like for Japanese beetles, I have regussa roses in my garden and they  
**[0:42:05-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:42:05):**  seem to attract the beetles that don't mess with my raspberries.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:42:10):**  And then for birds, birds do like to eat berries, but they're more unbalanced, they're more  
**[0:42:16-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:42:16):**  beneficial than not.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:42:19):**  I planted elderberries along the border of one of my gardens and they're ripening around  
**[0:42:26-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:42:26):**  the same time as my grapes are ripening.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:42:28):**  I noticed that the birds prefer the elderberries to the grapes.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:42:31):**  So they're eating the elderberries and leaving the grapes alone and that's fine with me because  
**[0:42:34-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:42:34):**  I have an abundance of elderberries, I can't use all of them.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:42:39):**  So those are some examples of dealing with insect pests.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:42:43):**  Because my soil is heavy clay, it doesn't drain well.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:42:51):**  So plants that need really good drainage tend to get diseases, fungal diseases related to  
**[0:42:58-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:42:58):**  too much moisture.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:43:02):**  And I've just over time either moved them to higher ground if I saw they were having  
**[0:43:08-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:43:08):**  issues or realized I just can't expect food from them.

**[0:43:21-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:43:21):**  bushy ones that have been developed to produce good fruit.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:43:27):**  For 10 years, I've never had fruit.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:43:31):**  I've seen fungal spores growing out of the immature fruit.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:43:38):**  These plants grow wild in my woods, in the surrounding woods, and they seem to like to  
**[0:43:43-0:43:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:43:43):**  be on the rocky ridges where the drainage is fabulous, maybe not a lot of soil, but  
**[0:43:50-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:43:50):**  maybe that's their niche because there's not a lot of competition there.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:43:53):**  But they do really well there, they don't do well in my clay.

**[0:44:02-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:44:02):**  fruit they might get gets eaten by the birds before it's ripe enough for me.

**[0:44:10-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:44:10):**  But then I have honey berries.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:44:14):**  It all balances out I'm sure.

**[0:44:21-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:44:21):**  well.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:44:22):**  Right.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:44:23):**  And it sounds like you've leveraged really well the diversity of life in your orchard,  
**[0:44:28-0:44:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:44:28):**  in your edible garden, to take care of a lot of the tasks that you would otherwise have  
**[0:44:32-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:44:32):**  to do with technology or with the labor.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:44:36):**  And just like you mentioned before, this is far less work than a similar sized annual  
**[0:44:41-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:44:41):**  garden.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:44:42):**  But can you give me an idea of how many hours or you know how much labor in different seasons  
**[0:44:48-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:44:48):**  is required to maintain this?  
**[0:44:50-0:44:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:44:50):**  Well, my first answer to that is the biggest chunk of labor is the harvest.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:44:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:45:00):**  And I have when starting in June when my berry plants start to ripen, I have a lot of them  
**[0:45:07-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:45:07):**  and it's quite labor intensive to pick them.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:45:12):**  Some of the berries need to be picked daily like raspberries.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:45:16):**  So that's a daily hour, hour and a half tour.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:45:19):**  One when they're ripe and I've arranged it now so that I'll have summer raspberries from  
**[0:45:24-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:45:24):**  July right through till September.

**[0:45:36-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:45:36):**  a half to pick the berries and they need to be picked every day because they ripen daily  
**[0:45:40-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:45:40):**  and you don't want berries to go bad on the vine because then you're attracting pests.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:45:46):**  So one of the practices to prevent pests and disease is what's called good sanitation.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:45:53):**  And that means you're picking everything.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:45:55):**  You're not letting things rot on the vine.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:45:58):**  Plus you're pruning out congestion so there's good air circulation.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:46:04):**  So with raspberries, I have my first crop, my first summer raspberry crop probably ends  
**[0:46:09-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:46:09):**  around first week in August.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:46:12):**  It's time to cut out those stems because they're done.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:46:16):**  They're two years old, they're done to make room for the other stems that are coming up  
**[0:46:20-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:46:20):**  from a fall crop.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:46:21):**  So that kind of thing is a little time consuming.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:46:25):**  What mostly is the harvesting?  
**[0:46:28-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:46:28):**  Spot leading continues, pruning out dead stuff.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:46:36):**  How many hours?  
**[0:46:38-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:46:38):**  I wish I could tell you.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:46:40):**  I'm sure it varies a lot too by season.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:46:43):**  It does.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:46:44):**  Right now I've been finishing pruning.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:46:47):**  I've been doing a lot of sheet mulching and make up for my negligence last year.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:46:52):**  I'd say I'm spending about, and I'm mowing.  
**[0:46:56-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:46:56):**  It's getting to be in the middle of May, first time to mow my paths because I do have sod  
**[0:47:01-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:47:01):**  in some pathways.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:47:03):**  So I'd say I don't work every day.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:47:06):**  I'd say maybe three hours a day right now.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:47:09):**  That's pretty reasonable, especially for a retirement job.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:47:14):**  And this is over an acre.

**[0:47:25-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:47:25):**  your herbs, you'll pull a couple of leaves.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:47:27):**  That'll be it.

**[0:47:32-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:47:32):**  It's not going to be huge.

**[0:47:48-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:47:48):**  Because I've managed volunteers on our farm back when I was in Guatemala and sometimes

**[0:50:37-0:50:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:50:37):**  they can become more independent and there's less demand on your time for supervision.

**[0:51:32-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:51:32):**  to on this interview?  
**[0:51:33-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:51:33):**  Well, the book is really written to lay people.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:51:37):**  This is not written to farmers.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:51:39):**  It's written to just somebody who has a little plot of land, maybe around their house or  
**[0:51:43-0:51:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:51:43):**  they bought some property in the country and they want to make it productive.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:51:49):**  You can landscape with just attractive plants or you can landscape with edibles.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:51:53):**  Why not have something you can eat?  
**[0:51:57-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:51:57):**  It starts out the first chapters talk about some of the permaculture principles that we've  
**[0:52:03-0:52:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:52:03):**  discussed and how to integrate them in your garden and how to study your land and plan  
**[0:52:08-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:52:08):**  your plantings and even how to plant a tree.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:52:13):**  Some people have never done that.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:52:14):**  So I did very detailed, it's very practical.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:52:16):**  Everything is so practical in the book.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:52:18):**  Very detailed instructions, how to plant a tree, how to grow herbs from seed, for example,  
**[0:52:23-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:52:23):**  how to prune certain kinds of berry bushes, very specific instructions.  
**[0:52:27-0:52:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:52:27):**  And then the middle section of the book talks about all the different plants that you can  
**[0:52:33-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:52:33):**  grow and describes them and also talks about my experience with them that I hope you can  
**[0:52:37-0:52:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:52:37):**  learn from and apply to your setting.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:52:40):**  So it starts with the overstory, which are plants from 30 feet and up.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:52:46):**  And then it goes into what's called the understory between 10 and 20 feet, mostly.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:52:53):**  Usually your fruit trees are found there.  
**[0:52:55-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:52:55):**  Shrub layer, which could be up to 12 feet.  
**[0:52:58-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:52:58):**  Herbaceous, which are plants that grow during the growing season and die back to the ground  
**[0:53:04-0:53:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:53:04):**  in the cold season and grow back for next year.  
**[0:53:08-0:53:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:53:08):**  Ground covers, plants that have roots and then vine.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:53:14):**  So there's seven different layers.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:53:15):**  And also mushrooms.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:53:18):**  So I tell you how you can actually grow mushrooms in your backyard.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:53:22):**  Shiitake, oysters and wine caps.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:53:29):**  And just a little aside, I have a little section on growing saffron.  
**[0:53:36-0:53:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:53:36):**  Saffron is a crocus that actually glows in the fall.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:53:40):**  And I thought, oh, this is from the Middle East.  
**[0:53:43-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:53:43):**  It's from a hot climate.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:53:44):**  So you can actually grow it in zone four.  
**[0:53:46-0:53:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:53:46):**  And I've been successful.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:53:47):**  So I describe in detail how to do that.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:53:49):**  The biggest deal with that is protecting it from rodents that loved to eat.  
**[0:53:56-0:54:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:53:56):**  And then the final section of the book talks about how to combine plants, like we discussed  
**[0:54:02-0:54:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:54:02):**  earlier.  
**[0:54:03-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:54:03):**  I have at least, I have probably 20 different examples of combination of plants that I've  
**[0:54:09-0:54:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:54:09):**  tried.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:54:10):**  And I talk about how they evolve over time.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:54:13):**  So some of them were quite stable and work well even after 10 years.  
**[0:54:17-0:54:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:54:17):**  And some of them had a life of their own.  
**[0:54:20-0:54:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:54:20):**  And I talk about how things evolved and maybe some misjudgment sign A. But it's all a learning  
**[0:54:25-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:54:25):**  experience.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:54:26):**  That's the way I see it.  
**[0:54:27-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:54:27):**  So you make your best guess.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:54:29):**  You try to make your best guess about what plants will get along with each other and  
**[0:54:37-0:54:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:54:37):**  in the habitat that you happen to have available.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:54:40):**  And then you observe what happens.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:54:42):**  And then make adjustments over time.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:54:45):**  So that's the last chapter, the last two chapters.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:54:47):**  And one of them I also talk about four people I've, four women I've known who have come  
**[0:54:55-0:55:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:54:55):**  to my farm and learned about what I'm doing in the edible forest and then applied some  
**[0:55:00-0:55:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:55:00):**  of the ideas to their own gardens.  
**[0:55:03-0:55:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:55:03):**  And I talk about, I call them inspiring stories.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:55:06):**  They're just short, but they're very accessible and they let you know that anybody can do  
**[0:55:12-0:55:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:55:12):**  that.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:55:13):**  Amazing.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:55:14):**  And I remember from my own look through of that book that the idea of growing saffron  
**[0:55:19-0:55:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:55:19):**  up in your climate was just amazing to me.  
**[0:55:21-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:55:21):**  It's one of those crops that I learned about when I first came here and it's a traditional  
**[0:55:26-0:55:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:55:26):**  part of the Mediterranean.  
**[0:55:27-0:55:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:55:27):**  But the fact that you managed to make it work up there is really cool.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:55:31):**  And there's so many gems in this book.  
**[0:55:32-0:55:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:55:32):**  I highly recommend it.  
**[0:55:34-0:55:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:55:34):**  Danny, can you tell our listeners how they can get in touch with you and learn more about  
**[0:55:38-0:55:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:55:38):**  not only your book and also your farm and the other knowledge and opportunities that  
**[0:55:44-0:55:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:55:44):**  you have out there?  
**[0:55:45-0:55:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:55:45):**  Okay.

**[0:55:52-0:56:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:55:52):**  And we do have volunteers that live in, so that's always an option.  
**[0:56:00-0:56:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:56:00):**  And you can get ahold of me.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:56:02):**  I have a website called the enchantededibleforest.com.  
**[0:56:07-0:56:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:56:07):**  And in that website, there's all the more information about the book.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:56:10):**  There's information about the edible forest.  
**[0:56:12-0:56:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:56:12):**  And also I started a blog.  
**[0:56:13-0:56:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:56:13):**  So every so often I post a blog entry there.  
**[0:56:16-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:56:16):**  And I think very shortly we'll be posting some videos of me doing things in the garden,  
**[0:56:22-0:56:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:56:22):**  like harvesting edibles, which I've been doing recently, including mushrooms.  
**[0:56:29-0:56:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:56:29):**  So you can email me, dannybaker at crossislandfarms.com.  
**[0:56:35-0:56:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:56:35):**  I'm happy to respond to an email.

**[0:56:41-0:56:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:56:41):**  I think that covers it.  
**[0:56:42-0:56:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:56:42):**  I'll make sure that I link to all of those in the show notes for this episode.  
**[0:56:46-0:56:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:56:46):**  And Danny, before we go, can you offer any advice to listeners who are looking to get  
**[0:56:50-0:56:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:56:50):**  started with their own edible perennial garden for the first time?  
**[0:56:55-0:56:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:56:55):**  Sure.  
**[0:56:56-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:56:56):**  Well, I would say test your soil.  
**[0:56:57-0:56:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:56:57):**  So you know what you're dealing with.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:56:59):**  No instructions from whatever lab is doing the evaluation.  
**[0:57:05-0:57:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:57:05):**  Study your land.  
**[0:57:07-0:57:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:57:07):**  So you understand what kinds of microclimates exist there.  
**[0:57:14-0:57:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:57:14):**  And start small.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:57:15):**  I would start small.  
**[0:57:16-0:57:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:57:16):**  Start with a small area.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:57:19):**  And as you experience some success, build onto that.  
**[0:57:25-0:57:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:57:25):**  And that way, you'll more likely continue to get frustrated and give up.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/dani-baker-on-why-its-never-too-late-to-start-your-home-scale-forest-garden/#t=0:57:31):**  Fantastic.

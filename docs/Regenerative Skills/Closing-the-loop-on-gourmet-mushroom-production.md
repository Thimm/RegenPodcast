**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:00:00):**  This is Regenerative Skills, the podcast helping you to learn the skills and solutions to create  
**[0:00:06-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:00:06):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:00:09):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gautier.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:00:12):**  A quick heads up to all of you out there who dream of starting your own farm one day or  
**[0:00:17-0:00:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:00:17):**  who are striving to improve your existing farm and generate higher profits in a regenerative  
**[0:00:21-0:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:00:21):**  way.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:00:23):**  Richard Perkins, who has been interviewed multiple times on this show, including in  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:00:26):**  last week's episode, is now offering an intimate look into how he runs his highly successful  
**[0:00:31-0:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:00:31):**  farm in a new free mini-series on profitable regenerative farming, which includes some  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:00:37):**  great resources, including a downloadable guide on how to build his rollaway nest boxes,  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:00:42):**  an editable spreadsheet download for the financial modeling of his beef enterprise, and a lot  
**[0:00:47-0:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:00:47):**  more.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:00:48):**  The mini-series is open now and is only available for a limited time.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:00:52):**  It'll shut down on the 10th of June, so don't twiddle your thumbs on this one.

**[0:01:00-0:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:01:00):**  away.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:01:01):**  Hey everybody, and welcome back.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:01:04):**  Now I've been making some really cool contacts here in Catalunya recently, and even though  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:01:08):**  site visits and trips out to projects have been stalled as the country slowly starts  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:01:12):**  to open up, I've been jumping at any chance to get back out in the field.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:01:17):**  One of the projects that I've been most excited to get back out to see since my first visit  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:01:21):**  there back in December is the farm at Mas Rajols and the gourmet mushroom growing operation  
**[0:01:27-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:01:27):**  that it hosts called Maisilio.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:01:29):**  I first got invited to come out to see them by my friend Sven Kallen, who works with the  
**[0:01:35-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:01:35):**  European Commission's Life Terra initiative and is the founder of Volterra, both of which  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:01:41):**  are strongly involved with tree planting projects around the continent.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:01:45):**  Back then they were just getting set up, but on this second visit just a couple of weeks  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:01:49):**  ago, I got to see just how far the operation has come in its development and in the setup  
**[0:01:54-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:01:54):**  of their production facilities.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:01:56):**  I've been blown away by just how well thought out the whole project is.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:02:00):**  They turn waste products from the leavings of the timber industry into multiple high  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:02:04):**  value products and integrate them with the existing beef cattle operation on the farm  
**[0:02:08-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:02:08):**  that they collaborate with.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:02:10):**  In the interview in today's session I got to sit down with Thomas Vigors, the co-founder  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:02:14):**  and product manager of Maisilio and Jason Statham Doppelganger.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:02:19):**  I'm not kidding, check out his picture on our Instagram and you will see what I mean.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:02:23):**  Anyway, this was to talk about all of the motivations and processes that they've connected  
**[0:02:27-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:02:27):**  to create a high value gourmet product that also gives back to their environment and local  
**[0:02:33-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:02:33):**  community.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:02:34):**  So let's jump right into things and I'll let Thomas introduce himself.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:02:37):**  My name is Thomas, Dutch, but I lived different places.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:02:45):**  I ended up at one point in Argentina where I started experimenting with mushroom cultivation  
**[0:02:54-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:02:54):**  but was not able to turn it into a commercial business.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:03:01):**  And then three and a half years ago moved to Catalunya and saw an opportunity to turn  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:03:10):**  it into a commercial business operation.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:03:16):**  So I started by looking for a space to do this and that's when we identified where we  
**[0:03:26-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:03:26):**  are now, where we found an underground space with almost perfect conditions to grow mushrooms  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:03:33):**  without having to put much energy into it.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:03:38):**  Tell me about what the context is here that made it possible to start this as a business  
**[0:03:43-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:03:43):**  that didn't work in some of the other places that you've lived.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:03:45):**  I know there's quite a mushroom culture here in Catalunya.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:03:50):**  Does that mean that there's a market for it or that simply people like to go into the  
**[0:03:54-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:03:54):**  mountains and collect?  
**[0:03:56-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:03:56):**  Yeah, well, Argentina doesn't have such a culture of mushroom consumption is very low  
**[0:04:06-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:04:06):**  and then it's also hard to start a new business because of where we were.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:04:12):**  When I arrived here, I immediately saw that there is this mushroom culture.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:04:17):**  Everybody goes into the forest in the season and can identify at least two, three different  
**[0:04:23-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:04:23):**  mushrooms.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:04:26):**  So I saw an opportunity.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:04:30):**  Even though the mushrooms we're cultivating are not the same ones that you'll typically  
**[0:04:35-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:04:35):**  find in the forest.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:04:36):**  So I still find myself often explaining about our mushrooms because, yeah, there's different  
**[0:04:45-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:04:45):**  kinds of mushrooms and many people don't know about the cultivation side of it.  
**[0:04:52-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:04:52):**  But mushroom as part of your diet is, yeah, people consume quite some mushrooms, but especially  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:05:00):**  during the season and now here we are with our cultivated mushrooms, which they can consume  
**[0:05:05-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:05:05):**  all year long.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:05:07):**  So tell me about how you found this space and what were some of the criteria that made  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:05:11):**  it conducive for the business you wanted to start?  
**[0:05:15-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:05:15):**  Yeah, well, mushrooms like humans space with a constant temperature.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:05:23):**  So an underground space is ideal, like a cave.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:05:28):**  In a cave.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:05:30):**  If you want to grow them all year long.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:05:32):**  Otherwise in a forest you are limited to the natural conditions of the forest and then  
**[0:05:36-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:05:36):**  you, that's why you find mushrooms in the forest in autumn mainly and some in spring.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:05:44):**  So an underground space is ideal because you have more or less constant climate inside.  
**[0:05:51-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:05:51):**  So looking for an underground space, I found this place where they had an underground space  
**[0:06:00-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:06:00):**  which was not used and the owners didn't want to rent me the space but wanted to participate  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:06:09):**  in this project because they saw the potential as well.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:06:14):**  That's how it started.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:06:15):**  Well, so describe where we are because we're listening to this and they can't see all of  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:06:19):**  the things that we've been able to tour around today.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:06:23):**  Explain the location and also the part of Catalunya specifically.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:06:28):**  Yes, we are in Tafetet which is about an hour and a half north, like inwards from Barcelona.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:06:39):**  In the Comarco Osona, we're at a thousand meters altitude here.  
**[0:06:47-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:06:47):**  Treeside, spectacular scene, forest surrounded by forests and right here, right now we're  
**[0:07:00-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:07:00):**  in a, it's an old massia, so an old farm that's converted into a hotel and they've added a  
**[0:07:11-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:07:11):**  new wing to the original farm and when they did that, they also created an underground  
**[0:07:19-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:07:19):**  parking space and when they did that, they were left with an underground space that they  
**[0:07:25-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:07:25):**  didn't have an immediate use for but because of the, how it was set up, they decided to  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:07:33):**  turn it into a space as well and that's the space we ended up using for our mushrooms.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:07:38):**  So we're inside the mountain in an artificial cave.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:07:44):**  Yeah, I mean, if I were to describe it, it'd be like where Batman parks his car in a forest  
**[0:07:53-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:07:53):**  that has something similar to like a Grand Canyon look if it were entirely densely forested  
**[0:08:00-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:08:00):**  in green, right?  
**[0:08:02-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:08:02):**  And there's this little niche inside of this parking hangar that is below a beautiful hotel  
**[0:08:08-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:08:08):**  with some of those spectacular views that you've ever seen and because of the microclimate  
**[0:08:12-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:08:12):**  that's created in this artificial cave, the conditions for specifically fruiting mushrooms  
**[0:08:19-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:08:19):**  are conducive.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:08:21):**  The temperature control and also some of the ways that you can moderate the humidity and  
**[0:08:26-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:08:26):**  the concentrations of CO2 if I'm not mistaken.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:08:29):**  Yeah, yeah, correctly.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:08:32):**  We did install some installations, but they require a minimum amount of energy to create  
**[0:08:39-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:08:39):**  this perfect climate for growing mushrooms.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:08:42):**  And yes, it's correct.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:08:44):**  We're talking about growing the mushrooms.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:08:48):**  We also now started creating the substrate.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:08:52):**  That's our new addition to the business.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:08:55):**  Well, so now we're going to start to unravel all of the moving parts of this business because  
**[0:09:00-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:09:00):**  there's a lot going on here and so far we've just talked about the cave environment where  
**[0:09:04-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:09:04):**  we're fruiting the mushrooms, which is the last stage of their life cycle if I'm not  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:09:10):**  mistaken or they start to go into decline.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:09:14):**  Well if you can look at the mushroom as the final product, then that's the last part,  
**[0:09:19-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:09:19):**  but it doesn't end there.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:09:21):**  Sure, it just ends when it's in a plastic bag or the mycelium can no longer has enough  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:09:26):**  to consume that it goes into decline.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:09:28):**  Yeah, well if the mushroom is the product, then yes, at some point the substrate stops  
**[0:09:35-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:09:35):**  producing mushrooms, but the substrate then we turn it into a compost and it can go back  
**[0:09:42-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:09:42):**  to the forest or so.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:09:45):**  So there's this whole circular life cycle of the production which is centered around  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:09:50):**  mushrooms but has so many other beneficial effects for the environment, including outside  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:09:55):**  of this cave environment.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:09:56):**  So let's talk about what mushrooms need to eat in order to grow and where you're sourcing  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:10:02):**  that material from first.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:10:05):**  Well we focus on mushrooms that grow on a wood substrate.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:10:10):**  There's many different kinds of mushrooms.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:10:12):**  This is what we focus on.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:10:15):**  So the substrate we produce mainly consists of wood which we source from the forest we're  
**[0:10:24-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:10:24):**  surrounded by.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:10:27):**  And then we add some supplements, but it's 90% wood that goes into the substrate.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:10:35):**  And so how did you identify this as a potential feed material?  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:10:39):**  Did you talk to the owners of the farm first and identify this as like a waste product  
**[0:10:45-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:10:45):**  that they were struggling to deal with?  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:10:47):**  Or did you see an opportunity from a contact that you had and saw an opportunity to put  
**[0:10:52-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:10:52):**  this into production?  
**[0:10:55-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:10:55):**  We started growing mushrooms on substrates that we bought from a provider from far away.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:11:05):**  But this didn't feel right from the beginning because we're surrounded by this forest here  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:11:11):**  and we were importing woods from far away and then creating our mushrooms.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:11:16):**  So at one point we got involved in a European life project called MicroRestore which gave  
**[0:11:28-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:11:28):**  us the opportunity to start using our local resources that we have available here to produce  
**[0:11:35-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:11:35):**  our own substrates.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:11:38):**  And it turned out that the forest and the wood we have here is a perfect resource for  
**[0:11:44-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:11:44):**  growing the mushrooms we want to grow.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:11:48):**  And at the same time we are maintaining the forest that needs to be maintained for various  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:11:56):**  reasons.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:11:57):**  And we can use the material that's not suitable for other purposes.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:12:01):**  We can work with small branches and we can turn that all into a perfect substrate for  
**[0:12:07-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:12:07):**  mushrooms.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:12:08):**  All the different parts came together within this European life project.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:12:15):**  So how you explained it to me previously is that in an effort to maintain the health of  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:12:21):**  the forest around here which is occasionally harvested for timber, there's a whole lot  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:12:26):**  of leftover material that tends to litter the floor of the forest.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:12:30):**  And this can, if accumulated over time, turn into a fuel for a higher risk of wildfires  
**[0:12:38-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:12:38):**  in the dry summers that I have here.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:12:41):**  And so realizing that this was perfect material for the substrate for the mushrooms, tell  
**[0:12:46-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:12:46):**  me about the different processing steps that it goes through before it is sterilized and  
**[0:12:52-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:12:52):**  inoculated with the spores.  
**[0:12:53-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:12:53):**  Well, let me also say that it's different if you manage a forest with the objective  
**[0:13:00-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:13:00):**  of harvesting wood.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:13:03):**  A company that goes in with that objective takes out different kind of trees than if  
**[0:13:08-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:13:08):**  you go in purely with the objective of maintaining the forest.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:13:14):**  If you want to create a healthy forest, it's different than when you want to get as much  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:13:19):**  wood out that you can sell later on.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:13:23):**  So we go in with a different objective into the forest.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:13:29):**  Once we have this wood, the process is that we chip it into small pieces.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:13:39):**  These wood chips are then also used for the hotel here which has a biomass burner which  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:13:46):**  is used to heat all the spaces, hot water, et cetera.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:13:51):**  And the other part we use for our mushroom production.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:13:55):**  So these chips are then go through a mill because we need like an even finer material  
**[0:14:03-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:14:03):**  to use for the substrate.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:14:07):**  It's not exactly sawdust, but I'll call it sawdust for now.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:14:10):**  Well, so you use a machine called a hammer mill, right?  
**[0:14:14-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:14:14):**  Which breaks it into pretty much it's just its fibers.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:14:17):**  It's almost like a downy material like you would stuff with pillows, I would almost say  
**[0:14:22-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:14:22):**  when it comes out.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:14:23):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:14:24):**  Yeah, and this is ideal for substrate for mushroom skews.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:14:28):**  If you would have sawdust, it would be too compact and using this hammer mill, we maintain  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:14:34):**  like the fiber so we get more structure in our substrates.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:14:40):**  And we came to the right size of material that gave us the best results.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:14:47):**  So then this material is mixed with some supplements that we use.  
**[0:14:52-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:14:52):**  Each mushroom has like a slightly different supplements.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:15:01):**  These ingredients are mixed and we add water to the right consistency.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:15:09):**  And then this is bagged and goes into, is being sterilized.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:15:16):**  After we sterilize it, we sterilize it with steam, hot steam.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:15:21):**  After sterilization, it goes into a clean room where we inoculate it with the mushroom  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:15:27):**  that we want to cultivate.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:15:30):**  The bags are sealed and go into an incubation space where the spawn that we've introduced  
**[0:15:42-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:15:42):**  colonizes the substrates, depending on which mushroom this takes from a couple of weeks  
**[0:15:50-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:15:50):**  up to a couple of months.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:15:53):**  And what I didn't realize when you first told me about this process is how most mushroom  
**[0:15:57-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:15:57):**  cultivation is not locally sourced for its materials and that some substrate might come  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:16:05):**  from one end of Europe, the spawn might come from another end, the processing facility  
**[0:16:10-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:16:10):**  might be in a different country.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:16:12):**  And what you've managed to do here is localize the process as much as possible and use resources  
**[0:16:18-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:16:18):**  from the ecology in this area, pretty much as waste resources to feed into this production  
**[0:16:25-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:16:25):**  process.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:16:26):**  Tell me about how it tends to be done in other places.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:16:31):**  What is more common than this localized production method?  
**[0:16:36-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:16:36):**  In Europe, you see a lot of specialized companies.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:16:43):**  It starts with the spawn producer, which is a very specialized specialty.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:16:49):**  It's like, imagine a laboratory.  
**[0:16:53-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:16:53):**  Then after that, you have the substrate producers, then you have the farmers who grow the mushrooms,  
**[0:17:00-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:17:00):**  and then after that, you have the ones who distribute the product, sell it, promote it.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:17:07):**  We started just growing these mushrooms, buying substrates and selling them to a few customers.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:17:16):**  Now that we have incorporated the substrate part as well, we're no longer dependent on  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:17:23):**  the substrate providers and we're using local resources.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:17:27):**  We have much more control of our process and it makes the whole process more sustainable  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:17:37):**  or it just feels better using local products.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:17:42):**  And in the end, we return it back to the forest.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:17:44):**  So it becomes like the circular model.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:17:48):**  That's amazing.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:17:49):**  And there's so many almost side benefits to this.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:17:52):**  So we've already talked about the maintenance of the health of the forest.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:17:55):**  We've talked about the production of nutrient dense and locally produced mushrooms, improving  
**[0:18:02-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:18:02):**  the economy of this area.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:18:05):**  But there's a lot of other things going on on the farm, including training of people  
**[0:18:09-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:18:09):**  to do this.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:18:11):**  There's the cattle on the farm itself.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:18:13):**  There's the creation of new products with the spent substrate.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:18:17):**  Can you tell me about each one of those in turn?  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:18:21):**  Yeah, the mushrooms is kind of what links it all, but it's true.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:18:26):**  There's a lot going on.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:18:28):**  Where to start?  
**[0:18:33-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:18:33):**  Well let's talk first about the training program.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:18:35):**  Who are you bringing in and what's the next generation of people who now know how to produce  
**[0:18:40-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:18:40):**  mushrooms?  
**[0:18:41-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:18:41):**  Right.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:18:42):**  So we're bringing in young people from around Catalunya at the moment to be trained in forestry  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:18:50):**  and mushroom production, mushroom production, substrate production.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:18:55):**  The idea is that we show them, teach them how the products from the forest, wood, can  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:19:04):**  how we can add more value than just providing wood chips.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:19:08):**  So mushroom is the main component, but we also look into other ways of adding value  
**[0:19:14-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:19:14):**  to the wood products and giving them better chances to either start their own business  
**[0:19:24-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:19:24):**  or find a job in this field, in this rural area.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:19:32):**  So we're training people in this way.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:19:38):**  Now let's go into what happens to the spent substrate after it's done being able to produce  
**[0:19:44-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:19:44):**  mushrooms.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:19:45):**  Right.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:19:46):**  When the substrate stops producing mushrooms, we mix it with cow manure, biochar that we're  
**[0:19:59-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:19:59):**  also producing on the site, and microorganisms to create a compost that can be used in farming.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:20:13):**  We're currently testing different compositions of this compost.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:20:18):**  And all the inputs are organic certified.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:20:24):**  So we will be able to create a compost of high quality compost and the idea is to make  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:20:34):**  this into another product that can be sold.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:20:40):**  And the first feedback we're getting is very positive.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:20:44):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:20:45):**  OK.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:20:46):**  And then so this was built around abandoned structures that used to house pigs.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:20:52):**  And this is another opportunity that exists in a lot of rural areas where a business may  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:20:57):**  have gone under.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:20:58):**  There's existing infrastructure that's slowly crumbling and has since been repurposed.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:21:02):**  But there is still a cattle operation here.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:21:05):**  And this business model has helped that in a number of ways.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:21:09):**  Can you talk about how the cattle are being managed now within this entire system?  
**[0:21:15-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:21:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:21:16):**  Well, first of all, it's true.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:21:19):**  We are our substrate production takes place in a former pig operation, which was very  
**[0:21:29-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:21:29):**  contaminating, was intensive pig farm.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:21:37):**  And the new owners didn't want to continue this.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:21:41):**  But they didn't immediately have a new idea what to do with all these structures that  
**[0:21:48-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:21:48):**  were there as well.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:21:51):**  Before we started with the mushrooms there, they already had like a small cattle operation,  
**[0:21:58-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:21:58):**  organic certified cattle.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:22:01):**  And then when we started with the idea of producing our own substrate, we gave a new  
**[0:22:09-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:22:09):**  life to this old pig operation and started using the different buildings.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:22:17):**  And yeah, rehabilitating for this new purpose.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:22:23):**  The cow operation is now also being linked to the mushrooms because we are using the  
**[0:22:30-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:22:30):**  manure in the compost that we're creating.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:22:36):**  And we're also looking into new products where we can use the beef, mixing the beef with  
**[0:22:46-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:22:46):**  our mushrooms and create a blended burger, the blended burger concept.  
**[0:22:52-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:22:52):**  That's one of the things we're looking into besides also looking into like the alternative  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:23:00):**  protein fields, like protein based on mushrooms.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:23:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:23:07):**  And I mean, there's even these little sub operations on the side that I like.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:23:15):**  Remind me if I miss any because there's bird and bat boxes going up in the forest that  
**[0:23:20-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:23:20):**  are increasing biodiversity and there's even experiments with mushrooms being cultivated  
**[0:23:27-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:23:27):**  in the traditional way of inoculating logs.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:23:30):**  And I mean, how have so many ideas been able to come together in a way that facilitates  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:23:38):**  the entire operation?  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:23:39):**  A lot of people really struggle to manage one or two operations but there's a lot of  
**[0:23:43-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:23:43):**  moving parts here.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:23:45):**  How are you managing this complexity?  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:23:47):**  Is it just that each person has an enterprise that they manage on their own or was this  
**[0:23:52-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:23:52):**  part of the design from the beginning to have so many synergistic, I guess, branches or  
**[0:24:01-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:24:01):**  elements to this central operation?  
**[0:24:04-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:24:04):**  No, this was not thought out from the beginning.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:24:10):**  This is a result of the different entities that are involved in this project.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:24:16):**  Because I'm speaking from the mushroom business side but there's also the actually the beef,  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:24:24):**  the cattle side, it's another business.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:24:27):**  Then there's also Volterra is involved.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:24:30):**  They are doing the biochar and the bird houses you are referring to.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:24:37):**  So there's a bunch of parties involved and it's the synergy between these different parties  
**[0:24:44-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:24:44):**  that are involved that creates all these new initiatives.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:24:53):**  So far they really connect well.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:24:59):**  Referring to the log cultivation that we've also started.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:25:05):**  We started doing workshops showing people the traditional way of mushroom cultivation.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:25:11):**  And we want to also link that to the hotel so we can show people people can stay in the  
**[0:25:18-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:25:18):**  hotel.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:25:19):**  We can teach them everything about the traditional way of cultivating mushrooms, the new way  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:25:26):**  of cultivating mushrooms, collecting mushrooms in the forest.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:25:31):**  Then as you've seen here, we also have a restaurant so people can also then try the mushrooms  
**[0:25:39-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:25:39):**  we grow.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:25:40):**  So we can show the whole process from managing the forest to eating the mushrooms here in  
**[0:25:48-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:25:48):**  the restaurant.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:25:49):**  It's amazing and now that I've seen it in person throughout all of these steps and multiple  
**[0:25:54-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:25:54):**  times as this operation has grown and continues to develop, it's really impressive.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:26:00):**  Since you're focused on the mushrooms themselves, let's talk mushrooms.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:26:04):**  So tell me about the different varieties that you produce here and how you came to choose  
**[0:26:08-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:26:08):**  these ones specifically.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:26:10):**  Right.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:26:11):**  Well, first of all, we grow mushrooms that grow on wood substrate.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:26:16):**  So the best known variety that we grow is shiitake, which is originally from Japan,  
**[0:26:30-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:26:30):**  China.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:26:31):**  We also grow some mushrooms that you can find here in the forest.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:26:38):**  For example, the king oyster and hen of the woods, which people love because it's a mushroom  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:26:47):**  that's hard mushrooms that are hard to find in the forest and you can if you can find  
**[0:26:52-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:26:52):**  them you can find the only in the season.  
**[0:26:54-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:26:54):**  Now people can enjoy them all year long and they're clean and they are from a source where  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:27:02):**  they know they're not taken out of the forest.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:27:08):**  And then we are also working with other varieties that are not so well known and working with  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:27:18):**  chefs to introduce them.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:27:22):**  Shriekers are always interested in new varieties, but then we also have to see that the consumer  
**[0:27:28-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:27:28):**  is actually willing to explore these new varieties.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:27:37):**  And so you're managing a number of different fruiting cycles and different potential markets  
**[0:27:43-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:27:43):**  for each one while also dealing with the marketing to a culture that is perhaps not used to eating  
**[0:27:50-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:27:50):**  mushrooms most associated with Asian cuisine.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:27:54):**  How have you been finding the response outside of maybe niche restaurants or markets or chefs  
**[0:28:01-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:28:01):**  were willing to experiment with it?  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:28:04):**  Are you seeing a lot of interest from the general public or is this probably going to  
**[0:28:09-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:28:09):**  remain a niche product for a while?  
**[0:28:13-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:28:13):**  No, well speaking about shiitake for example was already introduced here about 20 years  
**[0:28:21-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:28:21):**  ago so there's a whole history and most people know shiitake.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:28:28):**  But the other varieties are not so known but there's a bigger increasing interest every  
**[0:28:38-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:28:38):**  day because people are looking for healthy food and healthy alternatives to meat and  
**[0:28:48-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:28:48):**  also alternatives that are healthy for the planet and mushrooms can offer this.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:28:58):**  And we see also in the media there's a lot of interest now for mushrooms but at the same  
**[0:29:04-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:29:04):**  time there's still a lot of work to do and so we also put quite some effort into promoting  
**[0:29:10-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:29:10):**  our products.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:29:11):**  Yeah, I remember from last time I think it was the wine caps that you let me try and  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:29:16):**  I brought those home and we did like a shredded barbecue almost pulled pork style sandwich  
**[0:29:21-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:29:21):**  which came out so good.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:29:23):**  I got to send you pictures of those man, that was a delicious sandwich.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:29:27):**  So this project is still in development.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:29:30):**  You've come a really long way since I first came to see it a couple of months ago but  
**[0:29:33-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:29:33):**  tell me about the vision moving forward.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:29:35):**  How much are you going to increase in production and in your setup and where are you hoping  
**[0:29:41-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:29:41):**  that this will be in the next couple of years?  
**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:29:46):**  There's a couple of directions and a couple of things we're working on.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:29:52):**  First thing is that we now that we are producing substrate we want to give other people also  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:29:59):**  the opportunity to start growing mushrooms using our substrate because producing substrate  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:30:04):**  is the most, the hard part.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:30:09):**  So we are going to, we want to help start other people, start their mushroom production  
**[0:30:17-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:30:17):**  by teaching them what kind of space they need and then providing the main input which will  
**[0:30:25-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:30:25):**  be our substrate.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:30:27):**  That's one part and we're looking at the whole of Spain.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:30:33):**  Other part is the protein, the alternative, meat alternative.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:30:42):**  We're looking into using mushrooms to into like burgers, etc.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:30:50):**  Potentially also mycelium, more research involved there.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:30:55):**  We're working with a couple of research institutes on this.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:31:01):**  And then the other thing in order to increase our sales of fresh mushrooms we are also looking  
**[0:31:09-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:31:09):**  into intensifying our cooperation with other mushroom producers here and start some kind  
**[0:31:20-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:31:20):**  of cooperative so we can start doing our sales distribution and promotion together.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:31:32):**  So we can reach more people and our products can be enjoyed by more people.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:31:40):**  And so how does this look from a business perspective?  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:31:43):**  Is this something that you would recommend, say a first time or an early entrepreneur  
**[0:31:48-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:31:48):**  get into?  
**[0:31:49-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:31:49):**  Is it something that you can run on a small scale or does it require the size and the  
**[0:31:53-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:31:53):**  infrastructure that you currently have?  
**[0:31:56-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:31:56):**  If we're talking about growing mushrooms by buying substrate you can grow this in a small  
**[0:32:05-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:32:05):**  scale and you can grow this in a shipping container.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:32:12):**  You can easily equip a shipping container with installations to create the right climate  
**[0:32:20-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:32:20):**  to grow mushrooms.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:32:21):**  You can place this container close to a city and start producing mushrooms with substrates  
**[0:32:33-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:32:33):**  within a matter of weeks.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:32:37):**  So yes, that's what we now want to promote and help people start producing mushrooms.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:32:47):**  And yeah, this requires little investment, relatively little investment.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:32:52):**  If you compare it at like the whole operation that we have now here in place where we produce  
**[0:32:59-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:32:59):**  our substrate and all the other parts that are involved.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:33:03):**  But just growing mushrooms using our substrates, anybody can start growing mushrooms within  
**[0:33:10-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:33:10):**  weeks.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:33:12):**  Awesome.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:33:14):**  And so where can people go to find your products and maybe learn more about this process and  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:33:21):**  potentially even replicate it or start up something similar wherever they are?  
**[0:33:25-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:33:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:33:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:33:27):**  So please welcome to contact us, mycelio.eu and on social media mycelioorganic.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:33:39):**  You can contact us, you can come visit us and we'd love to show you around and share  
**[0:33:45-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:33:45):**  our enthusiasm for mushrooms.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:33:49):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:33:50):**  And I highly recommend that.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:33:51):**  I've been here now two times and it's better every time that I come.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:33:54):**  This place is really impressive.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:33:56):**  There's a lot going on, everything from the management of the forest, the mushrooms themselves,  
**[0:34:01-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:34:01):**  the community aspect.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:34:03):**  And you got to check out this restaurant too.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:34:05):**  What they do with the mushrooms is really cool.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:34:07):**  Thomas, man, thanks so much for taking the time.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:34:09):**  It's been such a joy getting to see this operation and seeing it grow in such a short time.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:34:15):**  Great.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:34:16):**  Thanks.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:34:17):**  You're welcome any time to come see us continue on this journey.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:34:21):**  Oh, I certainly will.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:34:22):**  In fact, count me in for one of those trainings one of these times.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:34:25):**  I really want to learn how to get involved and do this more myself.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:34:27):**  All right.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:34:28):**  I'll let you know.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:34:29):**  All right.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:34:30):**  Thanks, man.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:34:31):**  See ya.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:34:32):**  All right.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:34:33):**  That wraps things up for this session, but I really hope you enjoyed learning about all  
**[0:34:36-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:34:36):**  the ways that Thomas and his team have found to have a positive impact on their ecology  
**[0:34:41-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:34:41):**  and their community through their mushroom production business models, because I'm definitely  
**[0:34:45-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:34:45):**  going to be going back for more visits in the near future.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:34:48):**  I was also able to record a great interview during this visit with Sven Kallen, who I  
**[0:34:52-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:34:52):**  briefly introduced in the intro for this episode.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:34:55):**  He was also instrumental in getting this project off the ground, so keep a lookout in the next  
**[0:35:00-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:35:00):**  couple of weeks for my interview with him, where we'll be talking about reforestation  
**[0:35:03-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:35:03):**  and tree planting initiatives in Europe.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:35:06):**  And like always, these episodes are just the start of the ongoing discussion happening  
**[0:35:10-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:35:10):**  on our Discord server, and this week the questions that we'll be exploring in the community are  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:35:16):**  What opportunities do you have to close the loop on the resources and waste cycles of  
**[0:35:21-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:35:21):**  your business or of your household?  
**[0:35:24-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:35:24):**  What waste streams could be processed into valuable products or recycled back into the  
**[0:35:28-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:35:28):**  systems that they come from?  
**[0:35:31-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/closing-the-loop-on-gourmet-mushroom-production/#t=0:35:31):**  If you haven't already hopped on the server, you can always join for free by clicking the

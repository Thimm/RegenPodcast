**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:02:18):**  Hello and welcome back everyone! Today we'll be picking up where we left off for the last  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:02:23):**  installment of the three-part series with Graham Sate. For a long time, I've been working  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:02:28):**  to connect the pieces between ecological health, regenerative methods of farming, and the health  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:02:33):**  of the human body. Though many of you will find the connection between all of these three  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:02:38):**  elements very intuitive, I've worked to find experts and practitioners who've illuminated  
**[0:02:42-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:02:42):**  some of the essential pieces of that puzzle over the span of this podcast. Up until now,  
**[0:02:48-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:02:48):**  most of the discussions on this show have focused on just one of those elements at a  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:02:51):**  time, but today we'll continue with the last of the three-part series with Graham Sate,  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:02:56):**  who has made it his life's work to marry these disciplines and train farmers, healthcare  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:03:01):**  professionals, and ecologists around the world in the importance of caring for our bodies  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:03:05):**  and our ecologies as a single organism that requires all of the pieces to be in place  
**[0:03:10-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:03:10):**  for optimal function.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:03:12):**  Now if you didn't have the chance to hear the first two parts of this series, I highly  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:03:15):**  recommend it to give context to this episode, and I've linked to them in the show notes.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:03:20):**  So for a quick recap, Graham Sate is the internationally acclaimed author and educator who co-founded  
**[0:03:26-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:03:26):**  Nutratex Solutions, or NTS, and Nutrition Matters, as well as hosting the Nutrition  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:03:32):**  Farming podcast. He has written hundreds of published articles and the popular book Nutrition  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:03:37):**  Rules. Graham has formulated many of the soil health and human health products for which  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:03:42):**  NTS are renowned, and he has developed all of the nutrition programs that are the keystones  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:03:47):**  of their proactive management approach.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:03:49):**  Graham also owns Nutrition Farm, which comprises of two distinctly different properties dedicated  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:03:54):**  to the production of nutrient-dense, chemical-free food with forgotten flavors and enhanced medicinal  
**[0:03:59-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:03:59):**  qualities.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:04:01):**  Because our conversation turned into a marathon of learning, I decided to release it in three  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:04:05):**  parts which will make it easier to process and define which parts to go back to in order  
**[0:04:09-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:04:09):**  to review some of the information.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:04:12):**  Here in this third and last session, Graham and I wrap up the interview by talking about  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:04:16):**  the unique benefits of worm castings in the soil and all the nutrition that they are able  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:04:20):**  to cycle in the system. We also discuss how and why humic substance content in the soil  
**[0:04:25-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:04:25):**  is directly related to the profitability of a farm business, the new science and technology  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:04:31):**  that is transforming the regenerative ag space, and a lot more.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:04:35):**  Graham is an incredible wealth of knowledge and you'll quickly see why I chose to break  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:04:39):**  this interview into parts because every snippet contains enough information for a show by  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:04:43):**  itself. Now with that out of the way, I'll hand things over now to Graham.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:04:49):**  I'm wondering your opinion on all of the different amendments and things that would be required  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:04:55):**  to kind of kickstart a deficient soil or one that is missing essential biology and get  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:05:00):**  it moving in the right direction and how that differs from a treatment or a symptoms-based  
**[0:05:06-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:05:06):**  approach much like we find in current modern medicine and one that really works towards  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:05:09):**  a cure so that it starts to self-maintain and inputs and outside effects can start to  
**[0:05:15-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:05:15):**  be reduced, eventually eliminated once it reaches a homeostatic level of health, of  
**[0:05:22-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:05:22):**  holistic health.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:05:23):**  Yeah. So there's the whole soil food web community  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:05:27):**  in the various roles, but the most obvious of those and of course the most visible of  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:05:32):**  those is the earthworm. And when we look at the role of this little creature, which has  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:05:37):**  been obliterated in most farming soils, wherever I go across the globe, when I could travel,  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:05:43):**  you asked the question, how many of you have got reasonable numbers or any earthworms?  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:05:47):**  And most people haven't. We've taken them out of the equation. So one of the first markers  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:05:52):**  you're going to look for in terms of changing that soil and that soil fertility is the earthworm.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:05:58):**  And when we look at the earthworm, we look at its role. I mean, I talked about the inputs  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:06:02):**  of oxygen. Here's this guy maintains his own burrow. No one's allowed to touch that burrow.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:06:06):**  He drills down, comes up every night. And when he, when he goes down each night, he  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:06:10):**  lays this beautiful layer of microbial foods on the inside of his tunnel. And it's like,  
**[0:06:15-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:06:15):**  you'll never find any higher point in the soil than an earth.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:06:19):**  They measure in the inside of the measuring the inside of earth and burrow in terms of  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:06:23):**  microbial biomass, because that layer that he lies there is just filled with ridiculous  
**[0:06:28-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:06:28):**  diversity of microbes that come into feed. And then when he comes up each night to poo  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:06:32):**  and to grab a bit of organic matter to convert into humus, he sucks like a vacuum cleaner  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:06:36):**  and sucks up all these organisms. It's like setting a trap for something and then catching  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:06:39):**  it. Then he comes up, he drops this poo, then you analyze the poo. And what you find in  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:06:44):**  that poo is 10 times more nitrogen, eight times more potassium, six times more phosphorus,  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:06:49):**  and three times more magnesium, or one and a half times more calcium and a whole bunch  
**[0:06:53-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:06:53):**  of trace minerals and a unique group of organisms that are incubated in the earthworms gut that  
**[0:06:57-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:06:57):**  you can't find anywhere else. So you've got a fertilizer machine. And then where do you  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:07:01):**  get this one and a half times calcium abundant mineral in the soil? It's got a little calcium  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:07:06):**  carbonate gland and a pump. So you've got a Limeworks and a fertilizer factory in one.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:07:11):**  And a microbial works, an oculin system, all in one. And then we look at the most important

**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:10:12):**  that's what you want in the foley spray, whatever's required. And with that, you include, you  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:10:17):**  know, these, these natural stem, bio-stimulants, kelp is wonderful. Kelp has got so many different

**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:10:32):**  agent, you can book kelp with other minerals and collate them, but the highest known source  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:10:36):**  of the four hormones, cytokine, astugrelin, oxys and betaine, that every plant requires  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:10:41):**  for every stage of its growth, including post-harbors. Three of those hormones determine how fast  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:10:46):**  the food breaks down after you pull it off and put it on the fruit shelf. So, so basically  
**[0:10:52-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:10:52):**  those four hormones that govern every aspect of a plant, they are produced from bacteria.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:10:58):**  The plant produces them based on minerals in the soil, there's not some mineral spectrum  
**[0:11:02-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:11:02):**  in the soil, so you assume there's some shortage of genetic potential through a lack of those  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:11:06):**  hormones. And then the secondary sources, the microorganisms that look after the host  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:11:11):**  by taking some minerals from the soil and producing some of those same four hormones  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:11:15):**  and giving them to their host. Well, the soil has been knocked around, the base minerals  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:11:20):**  that you build the hormones from have been based on, so many plants you could argue,  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:11:24):**  cannot achieve their genetic potential. Now we've got one exception and that plant has  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:11:28):**  40 times more hormone of those four hormones than any land-based plant because it sits  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:11:33):**  in the perfect balance of 74 minerals. The findings on longevity studies are that the  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:11:38):**  ocean is the perfect balance of 74 minerals for humans and animals. And if you can swim  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:11:43):**  in the ocean, this new longevity study came out the month before last, if you can swim  
**[0:11:47-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:11:47):**  in the ocean for half an hour a day, five times a week, that's 12 to 15 years increase  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:11:52):**  in longevity because you're sucking in half a cup of that perfect balance of minerals  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:11:57):**  during that period. So the kelp lives in that perfect balance and absorbs those minerals.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:12:01):**  And because it's got all the building blocks, it produces 40 times more of those four hormones  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:12:07):**  than the next closest land plant, which is called aloe vera. And so then when you put  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:12:11):**  kelp out and those hormones work at tiny, tiny amounts, you can easily overdo them.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:12:16):**  So you can do it so cost-effectively with just tiny amounts, particularly as a foliar,  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:12:20):**  it's more effective as a foliar than in the soil. But then when you change those things  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:12:26):**  and you change the genetic expression in some cases, like kelp is wonderful for climate  
**[0:12:31-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:12:31):**  change because it's absolutely specific to both biotic, which is pest and disease pressure,  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:12:38):**  it's called the rescue remedy for hormones and several other compounds in kelp are evolved  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:12:43):**  in that and seaweed are evolved in that, but also for abiotic stress, which of course is  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:12:48):**  heat waves and drought and so forth and extremes like the hailstorm I just had on my Apple  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:12:54):**  farm last weekend, we give it straight in with kelp to buffer as a rescue remedy to  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:12:59):**  buffer some of that damage. So those kinds of things, those pain growth  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:13:03):**  stimulants that can, that also feed microbes, kelp feeds fungi only, it doesn't really,  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:13:07):**  doesn't have much impact on bacteria at all, it's all filled with long chain carbohydrates  
**[0:13:11-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:13:11):**  that feed fungi. So wonderful input. And we're finding species like sargassum that are running  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:13:17):**  rampant in climate change and sargassum is one of the very valuable kelps that you can  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:13:21):**  use in agriculture. So there's actually, we can say okay, we'll take that and there's  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:13:25):**  more of a grind because of the extra warmth and certain areas and so forth. So let's take  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:13:29):**  it and use it in agriculture. So there's some good stories in there in terms of the things  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:13:33):**  we need to do. Indeed. Now, as someone who has their finger

**[0:14:36-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:14:36):**  people are trying to stomp it out and still trying to keep crowdfunded and people still waiting for  
**[0:14:39-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:14:39):**  their units. But basically, the story on it was that it was done with a mobile phone app, and you  
**[0:14:45-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:14:45):**  could go into the supermarket and basically do a read of chemicals and nutrient density.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:14:50):**  And there's three or four technologies that are right on our door. Dan Kitchrich is one of them.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:14:56):**  And basically, I mean, one of the things that, you know, I've been training some really large  
**[0:15:00-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:15:00):**  grower groups around the world, people like Ranyan Farms and the whole corporation and so forth,  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:15:04):**  and doing the five day course, sometimes two or three times for them, whole supermarket chains  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:15:08):**  in LN. And part of what's driving their recognition of a need for change is that when those kind of  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:15:13):**  technologies become readily available, you pick them up online and go in the supermarket,  
**[0:15:17-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:15:17):**  the cat is out of the bag. I mean, you imagine it will check in the complex that they're feeding  
**[0:15:23-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:15:23):**  your child and so on. My God, it's got nine chemicals in it's got whatever. And suddenly,  
**[0:15:29-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:15:29):**  really the shit hits the fan, as we say in Australia. And so really, there's this  
**[0:15:34-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:15:34):**  recognition, really not much choice, but getting in this regenerative model. And of course,  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:15:38):**  there's a whole climate change story linked to it as well. And the whole health crisis story linked  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:15:43):**  to it. So it's just it's kind of like the shape of the future, but there might not be much of one  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:15:47):**  is where we're at with many, many people recognizing that now. So what was when I started  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:15:53):**  as a trickle of interest in this whole approach has become literally a tidal wave. Now it's a  
**[0:15:59-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:15:59):**  revolution is underway without the slightest trace of a doubt and it's happening everywhere. So it's  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:16:03):**  lovely to see. And really, in some countries, like I've done a lot of work in South Africa,  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:16:07):**  including in training, the major supermarket chain Woolworths, I've trained several times with  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:16:12):**  my courses. And they've launched what's called Farmings for the Future, where all of the food  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:16:17):**  is produced with this nutrition farming concept. And it's been a tremendous success story. Now the  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:16:21):**  UK supermarkets are meeting with me or were prior to COVID to talk about training. And they didn't  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:16:26):**  give the South African give the farmers any choice. They said you do these courses, you pass  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:16:30):**  these exams, or you're no longer a Woolworths grower. And I didn't believe that they could,  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:16:35):**  you know, do the things that we taught them to do. And then I found it worked. And I've got you see,  
**[0:16:39-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:16:39):**  I see you get these images that, you know, black farmhands, for example, and South Africa with all  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:16:46):**  of their monitoring tools, and they've got the little agronomy charts, writing up all the results  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:16:50):**  from all the things in their monitor. So they've got this feedback constantly of what's happening  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:16:54):**  in the crop. And they found that, you know, it does work. And it works really well. And to the  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:16:59):**  point that it's probably the world leader now, and regenerative agriculture, South Africa is  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:17:03):**  mainstream. If you're not doing something regenerative, you're a wanker, as we say in  
**[0:17:06-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:17:06):**  Australia. So yeah, it's lovely to say. It's really literally is just common sense is what  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:17:13):**  you're doing now. So and that's how it's changing everywhere. And that's really, really good to say.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:17:18):**  And there is some, you know, I said there's, I mentioned that maybe you can plug in the seven  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:17:22):**  things measured instantly, all of those changes, I can see very, very quickly, that we're going to  
**[0:17:28-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:17:28):**  have drone capacity, for example, when we look at how we can dovetail technologies with agriculture,  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:17:34):**  where you can get cameras significant with the program, obviously, with the pixelation,  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:17:40):**  the quality, to be able to differentiate, look at the leaf and say, yes, that needs some magnesium,  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:17:46):**  and some manganese and some zinc, and it needs it right now. And so you can just monitor your crop  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:17:51):**  and have fingertip control on nutrition with flying your drone out on a database. And that's  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:17:56):**  really close, we're almost there. So there's some really good things at the forefront of what's  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:18:01):**  possible, and where we're heading in this, in this new world, it's emerging, so that's lovely.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:18:08):**  But you know, you can't, you can't keep on putting more and more on for less and less response. If we  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:18:14):**  look at this one study I'm familiar with, which you can't find online, and I've got, you know,  
**[0:18:18-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:18:18):**  I had to study in one of my PAs put it somewhere in a folder, but I had the study printed out. And  
**[0:18:25-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:18:25):**  the study was looking at 700, sorry, 1400 school children, and 700 from earlier, 700 from urban  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:18:32):**  areas, urban areas, and they looked at the presence of the 13 most commonly used chemicals  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:18:37):**  in the tissues and the blood in the hair of those kids. And so we're talking parasites, pesticides,  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:18:42):**  nematicides, herbicides, and wormicide that most cattle producers pour down the throat.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:18:47):**  And to the horror of the researchers, they couldn't find a single child who didn't have  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:18:51):**  who didn't have unacceptable levels according to FDA standards of all 13 chemicals. See,  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:18:56):**  the two things that we weren't told about this chemical objective model, we were told, oh, yeah,  
**[0:19:02-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:19:02):**  we've done the trials on a guinea pig for three months, and there's no minimum registry levels,  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:19:05):**  and we stick to them while we don't, but sometimes we do, because they're not tested very often. But  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:19:10):**  assuming that they were correct, there's two things we weren't told about. One of them is called  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:19:14):**  bioaccumulation. So how does your body manage, even though they're tiny amounts, how does your  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:19:19):**  body manage them? Well, it's your liver, you've got a two-stage detoxification system, and your  
**[0:19:24-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:19:24):**  liver is at the head of that. And the liver is qualified to basically take any natural  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:19:31):**  contaminants. So they might be arsenic or a snake bite or whatever, or mercury, they're all  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:19:36):**  super toxic, but they're natural. So the liver's geared to have some kind of detox pathway to  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:19:41):**  manage those things. And many of our farm chemicals, at least half of them, are derived  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:19:46):**  from natural things, which the liver actually candy tops quite some degree. But the other half  
**[0:19:51-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:19:51):**  are our creations. And the liver says, what the bloody hell is that thing? Because it can tell  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:19:55):**  by the structure that it's not good. So it pumps them off, and it stores them in their fat cells.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:19:59):**  That's where they're stored. And that's part of what they measured on those children. That's  
**[0:20:03-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:20:03):**  called bioaccumulation, where they build and build like a little time bomb. I mean, what I teach my  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:20:09):**  farmers is that one of the greatest strategies to clean those residues out, because everyone  
**[0:20:13-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:20:13):**  has dealt with chemicals, you've got chemicals in them, you've got it on your hands and your body,  
**[0:20:16-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:20:16):**  there's no faster way to get it into your bloodstream or through your skin. It's just,  
**[0:20:21-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:20:21):**  it's the fastest way. It's on magnesium, 10 times more efficient, putting it through your skin and  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:20:24):**  taking it through your mouth. So you've got it on your skin, it's in your body. And half of those  
**[0:20:29-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:20:29):**  chemicals are going to, even though they're not, but sometimes it's quite concentrated in  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:20:32):**  agricultural, when it splashes on you or you get it on your hands or whatever. But you need to  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:20:37):**  understand that that's accumulating. And one of the chemicals that smells that has most,  
**[0:20:41-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:20:41):**  one very, very familiar smell is 2,4-D. It's an oxen, you just have to do this overdose of the  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:20:48):**  plant and it's got smell, I hate the smell, it's got a strong smell. So there's a technology that  
**[0:20:53-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:20:53):**  Japanese developed probably 20 or 30 years ago, it's called far infrared saunas. And they are  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:20:59):**  unique in that they use a whole different light spectrum and they penetrate and that light  
**[0:21:05-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:21:05):**  penetrates and it generates heat much more efficiently, light generates sweat much more  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:21:09):**  efficiently, quite a lot lower heats than a conventional sauna. But it pumps into those fat  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:21:13):**  cells, right? And even down to an inch and a half in and it pumps out still chemicals and very  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:21:19):**  commonly farmers will smell the 2,4-D on their towel. And sometimes the 5 or 6 saunas have still  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:21:23):**  got that sting, that's by accumulation. That's what they measured on those children. We weren't  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:21:28):**  told that, no one knew that that was happening. The second thing that no one was told was called  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:21:33):**  the cocktail effect. What happens when you've got those little residues and you combine them  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:21:37):**  together? It's ridiculous because there's no work done on it. No one, no work to say you put three

**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:22:09):**  I understand that 10 pharma chemicals, there are hundreds of thousands, between 100% of 10 things,

**[0:22:43-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:22:43):**  about that chemical model we weren't told. In your generation, my son's in your age group,

**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:24:23):**  be common knowledge among the population that could result in some real improvements in both  
**[0:24:28-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:24:28):**  the health of our souls and the health of our bodies? The starting point would be to understand  
**[0:24:35-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:24:35):**  nitrogen is hugely important, you've got to get it right, but you've got to get it right. It's  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:24:38):**  the Goldilocks mineral, you've got to get it just right, because it's a big price to pay for over  
**[0:24:43-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:24:43):**  doing it. And it's a big price for us health wise. So what's been under emphasized in the  
**[0:24:49-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:24:49):**  whole climate change story and agriculture's role in it, the figures are quite simply that we  
**[0:24:53-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:24:53):**  have a lot of carbon dioxide, which produces 25% of the CO2. So it's only the third largest  
**[0:24:59-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:24:59):**  contributor. First is coal-fired power stations. Second, it will surprise you, I bet you can't  
**[0:25:03-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:25:03):**  guess it. What do you think is the second? Loss of topsoil? No, the second is that loss of topsoil  
**[0:25:11-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:25:11):**  is, or loss of humus is third, but the second is actually concrete manufacture. The second  
**[0:25:17-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:25:17):**  largest is because you've got to burn calcium carbonate to make calcium oxide and often goes  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:25:21):**  into China, particularly with all of their protests. Well, all of us are but that's sort of  
**[0:25:25-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:25:25):**  come into the party now. So that's number two. But when we look at that blanket, first thing to  
**[0:25:31-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:25:31):**  understand is the greenhouse blanket is not something evil. We don't, we wouldn't be here  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:25:35):**  with that, that blanket of three greenhouse gases because the sun passes through that blanket,  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:25:39):**  warms the air, some of the heat warms up and some of us trapped beneath the blanket and that  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:25:43):**  creates a liveable climate. If it wasn't there, we wouldn't be here, we wouldn't have a liveable  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:25:47):**  climate without a greenhouse blanket. But we've made that blanket a little thicker than it used  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:25:51):**  to be. And of course, the three main gases, the CO2, nitrous oxide and methane. And then we look  
**[0:25:56-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:25:56):**  at agriculture, 25% of the CO2, 60% of the methane and 80% of the nitrous oxide. And that's the one  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:26:03):**  that's not being addressed because the sun is only 5% of the pie. But it's 310 times more  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:26:09):**  thickening of that blanket than what CO2 is. And agriculture is the major prime culture. And that's  
**[0:26:14-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:26:14):**  just mismanagement of nitrogen. So one of the simple things that people can do, because they  
**[0:26:20-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:26:20):**  also have nitrogen drives my yield, but people are putting insane amounts down, you know, and  
**[0:26:25-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:26:25):**  it's created so many problems. I mean, amongst multiple problems is the simple thing that  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:26:31):**  there is no water on the planet now, maybe there is somewhere in the Arctic or something, but  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:26:36):**  there's nothing, there's no groundwater now that's not contaminated with nitrates. Nitrates,  
**[0:26:40-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:26:40):**  Professor Otto Warbig won his Nobel Prize for discovering the root cause of cancer,  
**[0:26:44-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:26:44):**  the root cause of cancer is anaerobism. And what nitrates do is reduce the cell's capacity to carry  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:26:50):**  oxygen or to transport oxygen in both capacities. So nitrates are 200 published papers more probably  
**[0:26:57-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:26:57):**  linking nitrates directly to cancer, where you don't want to be eating some bacon like you guys  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:27:01):**  do. Because I've been at restaurants and breakfast and I just can't believe what the Dutch guys are  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:27:06):**  eating without, but the bacon, well, bacon sodium nitrate is a carcinogen and the World Health  
**[0:27:10-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:27:10):**  Organization say stop eating it, for God's sake, particularly the Dutch. So it's just something to  
**[0:27:16-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:27:16):**  be aware of. But the amount that we're losing to the atmosphere through volatisation and to the  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:27:23):**  water that we're drinking through leaching of nitrates is insane. And we, and part of that,  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:27:29):**  particularly the leaching story is the loss of humus, is the interplay with humus, because humus,  
**[0:27:34-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:27:34):**  of course, is the only thing you can store negatively charged anions. So humus is the storehouse,  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:27:40):**  the sulfur, which is deficient in almost every soil you look at, and it's really important.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:27:44):**  Boron, one of the most efficient trace minerals can only be stored on the humus colloid. And  
**[0:27:49-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:27:49):**  nitrate nitrogen is negatively charged. Humus has positively charged Velcro sites and it's the only  
**[0:27:55-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:27:55):**  thing that can say is we've lost a nitrate cell, we've lost our sulfur, we've lost our boron,  
**[0:27:59-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:27:59):**  and more importantly, we've lost a lot of nitrate. So the great gain and improving humus and of  
**[0:28:06-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:28:06):**  course, improving profitability accordingly and making nitrogen more efficient. But the other  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:28:10):**  thing is looking at nitrogen, how can we make this most important mineral? You can't deny it,  
**[0:28:15-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:28:15):**  you can't, you know, a lot of organic people fall flat on their face because of too little  
**[0:28:18-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:28:18):**  nitrogen and they don't have the options perhaps to utilize nitrogen properly. But so we can't  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:28:26):**  ignore it, how can we do it better? Well, one thing is we stabilize what we put in the soil,  
**[0:28:30-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:28:30):**  and that's where if we're using urea, humic acid and urea form a urea humate, now it can't leach  
**[0:28:35-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:28:35):**  it can't volatilize. So that's a great little strategy and it's well researched. But more  
**[0:28:40-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:28:40):**  importantly, as we look at the most widely useful nitrogen, which is urea, urea basically goes into  
**[0:28:48-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:28:48):**  the soil, starts life as an amine, this is important to understand this pathway. So urea  
**[0:28:52-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:28:52):**  is the amine form of the unique, uniquely the amine form of nitrogen, you put it in the soil,  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:28:58):**  immediately the urea enzyme converts it into the ammonium form of nitrogen, then bugs convert it  
**[0:29:03-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:29:03):**  to nitrate, you flooded your plant with nitrates and diluted the plant, often cause problems,  
**[0:29:07-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:29:07):**  as people have noted, most growers now put a big dose of nitrogen, I have increased insect  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:29:13):**  pressure. But once it's in the leaf, and stored in the leaf, you want it as a protein, you don't want  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:29:18):**  to stain there as a calling card for insects. And that again involves molybdenum, but it involves a

**[0:29:28-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:29:28):**  energy intensive processes in the life of the plant. They say it sucks up to 70% of photosynthetic  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:29:34):**  potential, well that could have been 70% money extra yield in your pocket, but it went into  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:29:39):**  something that it shouldn't have been going into because you've overdone that amount of nitrate  
**[0:29:44-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:29:44):**  that's ended up there. And so what you say use all this energy to convert it to an amine. And then  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:29:51):**  it's two more stages. And it's really simple to go from amine to amino acid to protein. So what  
**[0:29:56-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:29:56):**  would happen if you bypass that whole story of volatile urea in the soil, leaching off gassing,  
**[0:30:01-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:30:01):**  biggest source of it is urea and off gassing, and you follow your spray much, much lower levels  
**[0:30:06-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:30:06):**  because it's 12 times more efficient, not poly spraying in the soil. So you follow your spray  
**[0:30:11-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:30:11):**  the amine straight in the leaf, click amino acid click protein, there's nothing more efficient,  
**[0:30:16-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:30:16):**  you can't do it if you're organic, it was certified regenerative or a nutrition farmer,  
**[0:30:19-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:30:19):**  you can, and you're using between 7 and 15, some go as high as 20 kilos per maize of urea,  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:30:27):**  instead of 150 kilos of side dress. And so it's super efficient. There's no, you always put  
**[0:30:32-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:30:32):**  hemic acid with it to create a urea humac that can't volatise and can't leach. And that just  
**[0:30:38-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:30:38):**  turns the most inefficient amount of mineral fertilising into the most efficient. And that  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:30:44):**  saves you a whole bunch of money in the process. So the win-win scenarios, and there's lots of  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:30:48):**  them, but it's part of that whole story of nutrition farming and how it works.  
**[0:30:53-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:30:53):**  Wow, yeah, that it opens up so many possibilities for the farm business side as well, like not only  
**[0:31:00-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:31:00):**  reducing the amount of inputs, presumably increasing the profits as a result, but making  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:31:05):**  the type of structural changes that are going to improve the health of the entire ecosystem in the  
**[0:31:11-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:31:11):**  long run. And like you said, these things are directly connected to the profitability of the  
**[0:31:15-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:31:15):**  business, which hopefully reduces the stress levels and helps to improve the actual physical  
**[0:31:21-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:31:21):**  health of the farmers as well. Yep, you got it. It really comes full circle there. Well, Graham,  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:31:28):**  I think this is probably a good time to sign off. I could talk to you about this stuff all day,  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:31:33):**  the just amount of information is so valuable. I really look forward to perhaps getting you on  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:31:38):**  a panel in the future and having this discussion with other experts and seeing at it from a couple  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:31:43):**  of different perspectives. But for our listeners today, can you tell them where they can find out  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:31:48):**  more, both about your companies and the information you put out? Well, what's become  
**[0:31:53-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:31:53):**  incredibly popular, I'm sort of cursing myself that I never thought of it earlier, is this  
**[0:31:57-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:31:57):**  podcast that's become hugely popular. So it's called the Nutrition Farming Podcast. It includes  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:32:03):**  at least 40 or 50 minutes each time on all the kinds of strategies that you can  
**[0:32:08-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:32:08):**  approve, use to build a healthier, more productive, more profitable farm. And then it includes the  
**[0:32:15-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:32:15):**  similar story about how you can live a longer, happier, healthier life. And then there's some  
**[0:32:19-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:32:19):**  of my very dubious humor built in each time I've got this kind of larrikin Aussie humor that some  
**[0:32:23-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:32:23):**  people might not relate to, sometimes a little bit risque, but this is who I am. And that's what I do.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:32:29):**  But it seems to be very entertaining. People just, people listen over and over and over and say,  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:32:33):**  sometimes I have these personal consults that you want to solve problems, it's just coming to cost  
**[0:32:38-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:32:38):**  like 200 bucks or something, I do an hour with you, sometimes you want to do two hours. And we  
**[0:32:42-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:32:42):**  look at the solve test, we go through and sort whatever problems and make all sorts of suggestions,  
**[0:32:46-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:32:46):**  find out exactly what you're doing, how to tweak what you're doing. So it's more sustainable,  
**[0:32:50-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:32:50):**  more productive. And that's just become like insanely popular. I can't do much more of it.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:32:59):**  But basically, and that's based on the podcast. So the podcast is called the Nutrition Farming  
**[0:33:03-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:33:03):**  Podcast. And like I said, you become part of people's lives, because they listen to so much,  
**[0:33:09-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:33:09):**  you've heard how much information there's on our talk, it's like that for every podcast,  
**[0:33:13-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:33:13):**  and it's different stuff every time. And so people just listen and listen, so they can absorb it all.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:33:19):**  And then you sort of become always like part of their family. So that's quite weird when you're  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:33:22):**  doing because they know they've got such a prior understanding of everything, that you can really  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:33:27):**  move to a new level, because you don't have to teach the basics, they've got it all. So the best  
**[0:33:32-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:33:32):**  tool is in the Nutrition Farming Podcast, the website is www.nutri.com. And there I've got a  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:33:41):**  blog called the Nutrition Matters blog, you can sign up to that, you get a free copy of my book.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:33:47):**  But that blog's got I don't know how many tens of thousands described to that. And so I write,  
**[0:33:52-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:33:52):**  well, there's hundreds of published articles. So if you if you rather read rather than listen,  
**[0:33:57-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:33:57):**  that's the other option. And there's lots of videos online and so forth,  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:34:00):**  many different videos of my presentations around the place online. So there's plenty of places to  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:34:04):**  learn from. Yeah, and I certainly recommend your TED talk as well. It's a really good condensed  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:34:08):**  version for people who are new to your information to get an overview of some of the things that you  
**[0:34:13-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:34:13):**  talk about. And then from there, go into the podcast and the blog. All right, I'll make sure  
**[0:34:17-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:34:17):**  to put all of those links in the show notes for this episode. And I will look forward to seeing  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:34:22):**  you and connecting with you in the future. Thank you.

**[0:34:31-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:34:31):**  Graham, and I want to thank him again for taking the time to break down so many of the topics  
**[0:34:35-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:34:35):**  that he went into detail on and explaining them so well. Graham has an incredible way of making all  
**[0:34:41-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/greame-sait-connects-the-dots-from-soil-to-human-health-part-3/#t=0:34:41):**  of these connections and explaining them in a linear and digestible way. I really hope that

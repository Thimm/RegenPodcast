**[0:02:20-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:02:20):**  Okay, yeah, I'm into it.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:02:22):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:02:23):**  Alright, could you tell us a little bit about how you got started in trying out different  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:02:27):**  types of ferments and how you got to master your own Kombucha recipes?  
**[0:02:32-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:02:32):**  Huh, okay.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:02:34):**  So you know how, like, when you're ready to learn a lesson it seems like it's all over  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:02:39):**  the place?  
**[0:02:40-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:02:40):**  Yes.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:02:41):**  Because if you have like, yeah, it's like, it seems like it was nowhere and then all  
**[0:02:44-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:02:44):**  of a sudden it was everywhere.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:02:46):**  So I guess I got into fermentation in general, not just fermented beverages, through a friend  
**[0:02:54-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:02:54):**  who kind of acted as a bit of a mentor.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:02:57):**  We were both working in kind of a hippie vegan cafe type of place.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:03:01):**  This is about 10 years ago and she was a sourdough baker and she was also going to nutrition  
**[0:03:08-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:03:08):**  schools.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:03:09):**  And she would like come to work from school and tell me about all this cool stuff about  
**[0:03:14-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:03:14):**  what she was learning about the nutrition of fermentation.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:03:17):**  And then her and I started to get into some projects.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:03:21):**  I guess we picked up a copy of Sandor Katz first, well not his first book, but his book  
**[0:03:26-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:03:26):**  Wild Fermentation.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:03:27):**  Oh, that's a great one.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:03:28):**  And it kind of acted as our handbook.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:03:29):**  Yeah, it acted as our handbook.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:03:31):**  So we chose a few projects, but this person also got me into Kombucha.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:03:37):**  She gave me my first Kombucha mother.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:03:41):**  After I declined to taste it a number of times, she kept telling me about all the health benefits.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:03:48):**  And I was like, yeah, yeah, sounds good.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:03:50):**  Okay, lovely.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:03:51):**  And then inside I was like, that sounds awful.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:03:53):**  It sounds like it has so many benefits that it would taste vile.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:03:59):**  And so I went to her house and she just poured me something fizzy and gave it to me.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:04:03):**  I guess I assumed it was an alcoholic drink and I drank it, like enthusiastically drank  
**[0:04:09-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:04:09):**  it.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:04:10):**  I assumed it was cider actually because sometimes green Kombucha, like green tea Kombucha can  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:04:13):**  have that kind of apple flavor.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:04:16):**  And I was like, oh, I'll have some more.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:04:18):**  And then she told me that's the stuff I'm talking about.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:04:20):**  So it totally blew me away.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:04:22):**  And I had to learn more about it.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:04:23):**  I think I went home with my first mother that day.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:04:25):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:04:26):**  Now, walk me a little bit through the history of Kombucha, this recently popular beverage  
**[0:04:32-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:04:32):**  in the West, but it, while it only reached its notoriety in maybe the last five or 10  
**[0:04:39-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:04:39):**  years, this is actually quite an ancient technique for preserving beverages and boosting the  
**[0:04:46-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:04:46):**  health benefits.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:04:47):**  Yeah, yeah, totally.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:04:49):**  So like everything, like when we stumble upon it, we feel like, oh, that's brand new.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:04:54):**  Of course it is totally not brand new.

**[0:05:02-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:05:02):**  doing workshops.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:05:03):**  And it's interesting because sometimes even halfway into a workshop, someone will just  
**[0:05:09-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:05:09):**  look a little bit perplexed and they'll be like, but what is it?  
**[0:05:11-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:05:11):**  Like what is it?  
**[0:05:13-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:05:13):**  And I guess knowing a little bit about the history helps us understand its benefits because  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:05:20):**  we can look at like historical evidence of benefits and use and things like that, like  
**[0:05:25-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:05:25):**  get some wisdom from people who have done it before.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:05:27):**  So from what I understand, it's a couple of thousand years old.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:05:33):**  And what's really neat is that everyone gets it from someone who had it before.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:05:38):**  So that means that they get forms of Peliculos gobi and they have just given it to friends.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:05:45):**  So this is kind of a pretty cool tradition where people, you know, passed it on for thousands  
**[0:05:51-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:05:51):**  of years.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:05:52):**  And so we think that it started in China and some people think maybe like Manchuria or  
**[0:05:58-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:05:58):**  Russia area.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:05:59):**  But like many things that started in that area, the population, sorry, the popularity  
**[0:06:05-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:06:05):**  just like exploded.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:06:07):**  And so it traveled around Europe and was noted as a healing beverage there.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:06:14):**  One story is that the word kombucha comes from a Dr. Kombu who was Korean and he came  
**[0:06:19-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:06:19):**  and started treating people in Japan with like the nobility in Japan with his magical  
**[0:06:27-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:06:27):**  beverage of kombucha.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:06:28):**  So they called it the tea of Dr. Kombu.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:06:30):**  So kombucha.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:06:31):**  Nice.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:06:32):**  Yeah, so that's one story about the name, but it's kind of it's really shrouded in mystery  
**[0:06:38-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:06:38):**  and mysticism.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:06:39):**  And I think sometimes kombucha brewers like love that too.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:06:44):**  Yeah, of course.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:06:45):**  We're not totally sure because there are hundreds of names for it.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:06:48):**  Every culture that's been touched by kombucha has a different name for it.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:06:52):**  So I'm not sure why kombucha is the one that we use here.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:06:57):**  One story that I thought was kind of neat, I was brewing it and I was learning a lot  
**[0:07:02-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:07:02):**  about its anti-inflammatory properties.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:07:04):**  So then when I was inspired to go to nutrition school, I was excited about it, brewing it,  
**[0:07:09-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:07:09):**  and I brought some for kind of an honorary father, father and grandfather in law guy.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:07:17):**  And he is originally from Germany.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:07:19):**  So he's into doing stuff himself and he always made his own homemade wines and he made sauerkraut.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:07:25):**  He was really inspirational for me about sauerkraut.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:07:28):**  And I brought him over some kombucha and like, hey, this will really help your joints.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:07:33):**  And he took one sniff of it and he's like, oh, I know this stuff.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:07:36):**  We used to drink it back in Germany.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:07:40):**  And I kind of doubted that.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:07:41):**  I don't know.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:07:42):**  Like I, again, just being naive.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:07:43):**  But I was like, well, I don't know about that, Opa.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:07:47):**  I think you might be wrong about that.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:07:50):**  And then he described it and he told me the German name for the scoby or for the drink.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:07:55):**  My German is horrible.  
**[0:07:57-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:07:57):**  I'm going to try.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:07:58):**  He called it Heldenpilz, which I guess means zero mushroom.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:08:03):**  And he told me exactly how his mom brewed it.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:08:06):**  And I'm like, oh my goodness, you totally drank this before World War II.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:08:12):**  So then when I asked him, like, why did you stop drinking it?  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:08:15):**  And he said, well, I guess like after the war, he came to Canada pretty soon after the  
**[0:08:18-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:08:18):**  war.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:08:19):**  And he said also there was a shortage of tea and sugar.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:08:22):**  And of course, it fell out of favor.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:08:24):**  Yeah, that makes sense.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:08:26):**  Oh, yeah.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:08:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:08:29):**  So it's been around for a really long time.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:08:32):**  And it was about 10 years ago when I first tried it and it wasn't on the store shelves  
**[0:08:37-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:08:37):**  yet.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:08:38):**  I still seemed a little mysterious.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:08:39):**  I think my stepdad actually had a little boat in the 90s of trying to brew it at home, but  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:08:44):**  he was kind of doing it wrong and it tasted really awful.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:08:49):**  So I didn't catch on to it then.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:08:51):**  But then many years later, when I learned how to do it nicely, like make some really  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:08:55):**  lovely flavors and something that you'd actually want to drink, I got onto it.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:09:00):**  But then industry figured out how to brew it and get it onto store shelves.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:09:04):**  So now there's this huge explosion where you see it even in big box stores and stuff.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:09:10):**  It's true.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:09:11):**  Yeah, I've really noticed the growth and popularity of this and even some media coverage just  
**[0:09:16-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:09:16):**  in the last few years.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:09:17):**  I mean, like you said, it was probably about eight to 10 years ago that I heard about it  
**[0:09:21-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:09:21):**  for the first time.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:09:22):**  But it was kind of among my alternative friends who like to make their own stuff, brew their  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:09:26):**  own beer and wine.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:09:28):**  And we're experimenting with these things.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:09:29):**  But it's really caught on since then.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:09:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:09:32):**  So let's explore a little bit about the process of making kombucha.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:09:35):**  What ingredients and what equipment do you need to get started?  
**[0:09:39-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:09:39):**  Right.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:09:40):**  So what I like about this and like a lot of other fermentation projects, but this one  
**[0:09:45-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:09:45):**  in particular, you don't need fancy equipment at all.

**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:09:55):**  You want something with a wide mouth at the top, not something that comes in like a bottle.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:09:59):**  You want something because the pellicule or the scoby actually will grow to the size of

**[0:10:08-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:10:08):**  So you need this.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:10:10):**  You need a tightly woven cloth just to keep any sort of bugs out to put on the top because  
**[0:10:15-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:10:15):**  you want it to breathe a little bit.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:10:18):**  And basic sanitation equipment.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:10:20):**  So you don't need to sterilize things like you do with beer and wine.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:10:23):**  You just need like soapy water.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:10:25):**  And optionally, you could put it in a bottle.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:10:27):**  You're going to get nice fizzy stuff like you would buy at the store if you do the second

**[0:10:35-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:10:35):**  That's pretty much it.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:10:36):**  Other than that, just like you're brewing a big pot of tea.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:10:40):**  Kombucha is tea, sugar, water in a pretty specific ratio.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:10:47):**  The water and sugar is always one cup to four liters or one gallon.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:10:53):**  And then the amount of tea that you add is it depends on how you talk to.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:10:57):**  I use about four to eight tea bags per gallon.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:11:02):**  And then you just you basically just brew a big pot of tea and let it cool.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:11:07):**  Pour it into your glass jar and then you add a SCOBY and a little bit of the liquid from  
**[0:11:14-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:11:14):**  the last batch.

**[0:11:16-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:11:16):**  You don't stir it.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:11:17):**  You don't skim it.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:11:18):**  It's very low maintenance.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:11:21):**  It hangs out for about a week.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:11:22):**  And you can see the new SCOBY.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:11:25):**  You should be able to see the new SCOBY starting to form on the top.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:11:28):**  So it actually will replicate itself after every few batches.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:11:32):**  Now I would imagine you'd have to really let the tea cool down before you add the SCOBY  
**[0:11:37-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:11:37):**  unless you risk killing it.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:11:39):**  What temperature does it have to be at before you can add the bacteria?  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:11:44):**  Like no hotter than body temperature.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:11:47):**  Usually I just do room temperature.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:11:49):**  So just like making bread, like if you ever were to add milk or water that's too hot for  
**[0:11:54-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:11:54):**  it then your yeast would die.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:11:56):**  So yeah, anything that's body or room temperature is fine.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:12:00):**  Excellent.

**[0:12:05-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:12:05):**  batches go bad or turn out poorly.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:12:07):**  Now it seems like you just mentioned a really simple process.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:12:11):**  But what are some of your tips and tricks that you recommend to avoid some of the slip-ups,  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:12:15):**  the problems or maybe even just troubleshoot some batches that have gone wrong?  
**[0:12:20-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:12:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:12:21):**  So I've actually had people come to workshops with their SCOBYs and kind of show it to me  
**[0:12:26-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:12:26):**  like hey SCOBY doctor, what do I do?  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:12:29):**  How come it's not growing or why does it look like that?  
**[0:12:32-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:12:32):**  So one indication of the health of your Kombucha, so whether it is growing well is whether your  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:12:41):**  SCOBY looks I guess like quote unquote normal.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:12:45):**  But there's lots of different variations of normal.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:12:48):**  So I think a lot of people who feel like they've done it wrong or who come to me and say like  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:12:52):**  I killed my mother because another name for SCOBY is mother.  
**[0:12:57-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:12:57):**  I killed my mother, what did I do?  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:12:59):**  A lot of times they actually didn't kill the mother, it just grew differently than they  
**[0:13:03-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:13:03):**  thought it would.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:13:05):**  So usually it's a matter of like is it really is something really wrong here?  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:13:10):**  It's nice to have a visual reference of healthy SCOBYs.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:13:15):**  There's a couple of sites out there that have them and so looking up healthy SCOBY can be  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:13:22):**  helpful because then you know like sometimes they're very thin, sometimes they're quite  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:13:27):**  dark in colour if you brew with a black tea.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:13:31):**  People will be very concerned about spots on it and like rightfully so, you should inspect  
**[0:13:37-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:13:37):**  it for spots because you certainly don't want mould.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:13:39):**  That's the big bad thing that people are mostly worried about.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:13:42):**  Nine times out of ten it's not mould, it's a little tea leaf that escaped your strainer.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:13:48):**  So you have to just visually inspect it or if it looks like a white mould, potentially  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:13:55):**  it's bubbles.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:13:56):**  You know carbon dioxide happens when fermentation happens so sometimes there's little clusters  
**[0:14:00-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:14:00):**  of bubbles that happen at the top.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:14:03):**  So I usually just ask people to make sure that it's not one of those two things and  
**[0:14:07-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:14:07):**  if it definitely is mould or it probably is mould then something went wrong and you have  
**[0:14:13-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:14:13):**  to throw it out.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:14:15):**  It's pretty rare that that will happen.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:14:17):**  Now can you divide up the SCOBY in order to make multiple batches?  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:14:22):**  Yeah for sure and that's how it's gotten around the world so easily.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:14:26):**  So it does grow a new one.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:14:29):**  Sometimes they grow distinct from each other so you'll see one form on the top and then  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:14:34):**  it will be detached from the one that it grew from.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:14:37):**  Other times they'll grow kind of smushed together and they'll get thicker and thicker.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:14:42):**  So both are normal and if they're detached you could just take one, put it in a new batch.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:14:48):**  If they're attached you can actually cut them.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:14:53):**  Some people feel like emotionally attached to their SCOBYs and they don't want to cut  
**[0:14:56-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:14:56):**  them but you can cut it, it's fine.

**[0:15:03-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:15:03):**  if it looks perfectly round or whatever.

**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:15:07):**  So could you explain a little bit about how this fermentation process works?  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:15:12):**  Do you have some recommendations about how to facilitate the process and how the SCOBY  
**[0:15:17-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:15:17):**  is actually turning the sugars into that final product that tastes often closer to vinegar  
**[0:15:24-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:15:24):**  and even comes out carbonated?  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:15:27):**  Yeah absolutely.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:15:30):**  So I had to learn, I found myself learning about food science when I got into this and  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:15:35):**  science didn't used to interest me in school but then when I realized it applied to stuff  
**[0:15:39-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:15:39):**  that was gurgling away on my countertop I'm like oh you know what I need to learn about  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:15:43):**  the life of yeast and I need to learn about bacteria.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:15:47):**  I was simultaneously while I learned kombucha I was becoming inspired about gut microbes  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:15:52):**  and health and so I'm like yeah okay I'm gonna learn how to feed these good bacteria so they  
**[0:15:57-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:15:57):**  can essentially feed me.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:15:59):**  So the sugar in kombucha is a big question.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:16:03):**  It needs sugar, it has to have calories, just pure cane sugar is the best food for it.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:16:09):**  Some people use unrefined organic cane sugar, I use refined organic cane sugar.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:16:15):**  As long as it has calories that are easily accessible then it's fine so it will not eat  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:16:21):**  xylitol or stevia or anything like that.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:16:25):**  Lots of people do this as a health practice and they totally don't have sugar in their  
**[0:16:27-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:16:27):**  kitchens which is fine but the only good reason to have sugar in your kitchen is about brewing  
**[0:16:34-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:16:34):**  beverages like kombucha or water kefir.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:16:35):**  Yeah to facilitate the fermentation of beneficial bacteria.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:16:40):**  Yeah so it's essentially like eating the sugar so you don't have to.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:16:45):**  So the yeast and bacteria, scoby means symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:16:52):**  So unlike an apple cider vinegar mother, have you seen apple cider vinegar?  
**[0:16:57-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:16:57):**  It's kind of murky right?  
**[0:16:58-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:16:58):**  Yeah of course.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:16:59):**  Like the brown bits that float around in it?  
**[0:17:02-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:17:02):**  So that's part of the vinegar mother and the kombucha mother is related to that vinegar  
**[0:17:08-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:17:08):**  mother but the difference is it's not just a bacterial kind of pelicule, it's a bacterial  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:17:15):**  plus yeast and that's why we get the nice fizz that we're looking for in kombucha.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:17:20):**  So it's part kind of vinegar fermentation and part yeast and alcohol fermentation.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:17:27):**  And so it's really interesting because the first phase is more active in the yeast kind  
**[0:17:34-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:17:34):**  of department.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:17:35):**  So the first few days of brewing is actually the highest alcohol content.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:17:40):**  A lot of people think it gets more alcoholic the longer it sits but actually the opposite  
**[0:17:44-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:17:44):**  is true.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:17:45):**  So the first four days or so that it's sitting at room temperature you'll get a lot more  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:17:50):**  a lot of the yeast activity bringing some carbonation, bringing some alcohol and then  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:17:55):**  what's neat is it has kind of an alcohol regulation system in it where the bacteria then come  
**[0:18:00-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:18:00):**  in and they eat the alcohol and their byproduct is different types of organic acids.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:18:08):**  And so then we get something that starts to become more and more sour.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:18:12):**  So people tend to like their kombucha at different amounts of sour and different amounts of fizzy  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:18:17):**  and when you get kind of acquainted with like the nuances of brewing then you can start  
**[0:18:22-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:18:22):**  to control those things for yourself.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:18:25):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:18:26):**  Now I know you mentioned earlier about all of the myriad health benefits of fermented  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:18:32):**  beverages especially kombucha.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:18:33):**  Could you go over some of those and how you might use it as a medicine or a tonic?  
**[0:18:40-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:18:40):**  Sure.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:18:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:18:42):**  I think there are I've noticed that just as it's becoming commercially really popular  
**[0:18:47-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:18:47):**  there are new huge claims to its health benefits and I think some of them are warranted and  
**[0:18:53-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:18:53):**  some of them were misguided.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:18:55):**  Also because it's now on the store shelves we're actually finding better funded studies  
**[0:18:59-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:18:59):**  for it.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:19:01):**  A lot of the information that we had about kombucha before those studies were done was  
**[0:19:06-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:19:06):**  just you know folk wisdom.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:19:08):**  And so some of that stuff has proven to be true and some of it has not.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:19:14):**  So it's kind of an exciting time to be in fermented beverages because we know a lot  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:19:18):**  more about what's going on in there.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:19:22):**  Yeah so we know that the composition of different scobies from around the world are a little  
**[0:19:28-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:19:28):**  different.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:19:29):**  So if you're brewing in Europe the scobies that are being passed around there have a  
**[0:19:34-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:19:34):**  slightly different composition than the ones that are passed around here.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:19:40):**  So it's not it would be very difficult to say oh it has absolutely these bacteria in  
**[0:19:45-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:19:45):**  these numbers you know.

**[0:19:57-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:19:57):**  start drinking kombucha.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:19:58):**  A lot of people come to my classes saying I heard it's probiotic.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:20:02):**  There's a bit of a controversy about that actually.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:20:06):**  So in nutrition like the study of probiotics is still relatively new it's only like 50  
**[0:20:12-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:20:12):**  years old or something.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:20:14):**  And the more that we're discovering about our own microbiome and about the microbiome  
**[0:20:20-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:20:20):**  of the planet we are discovering new types of probiotics.

**[0:20:30-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:20:30):**  we consume them right.

**[0:20:35-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:20:35):**  So people were looking at the composition of scobies and of kombucha and noticed that  
**[0:20:42-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:20:42):**  actually most scobies that are being passed around don't have probiotic bacteria in them.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:20:48):**  There was a big sigh of like disappointment I think in the kombucha brewing community  
**[0:20:54-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:20:54):**  when when they heard it's not technically probiotic for the most part.

**[0:21:17-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:21:17):**  the lab to know.

**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:21:23):**  benefits and they thought it was due to probiotics.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:21:27):**  So like one thought I have about that is that there are many bacteria that still have not  
**[0:21:32-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:21:32):**  been identified that might become might be classified as probiotic as we learn more about

**[0:21:44-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:21:44):**  all.

**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:21:51):**  that makes people feel great when they drink it.  
**[0:21:56-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:21:56):**  One of them is you know when you shake a bottle of kombucha or you shouldn't really shake  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:21:59):**  it because it might gush but if you tip it over it has kind of a murkiness to it.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:22:05):**  Yeah it's not very clear.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:22:08):**  Yeah so that sediment is indicative that there's some spent yeast at the bottom and that spent  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:22:15):**  yeast is really really high in B vitamins.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:22:19):**  So that process of fermentation is super beneficial because like sugar and tea are you know very  
**[0:22:25-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:22:25):**  weak in B vitamins and it's cool because it just letting them sit there with the scoby  
**[0:22:31-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:22:31):**  actually produces B vitamins in the process.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:22:34):**  So when some people report feeling good almost immediately upon drinking their kombucha it  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:22:40):**  could be because of the B vitamins in it.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:22:45):**  I actually got like a pretty red face the first time that I that I had some and I thought  
**[0:22:49-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:22:49):**  it was because of alcohol because I get that flush with alcohol and it was probably actually  
**[0:22:55-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:22:55):**  due to niacin which is one of the B vitamins that's in kombucha.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:22:59):**  So that's a B vitamin that will flush your face red if you're deficient in it it will  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:23:03):**  flush your face red and then just go away.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:23:06):**  So it causes kind of these like mini hot flashes.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:23:09):**  So B vitamins is one reason and then it's also really high in enzymes and so it totally  
**[0:23:15-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:23:15):**  helps people's digestion and so a lot of people with digestive issues really like lean on  
**[0:23:21-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:23:21):**  their kombucha as a digestive tonic.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:23:25):**  And that gives me so many different ideas of how to use it.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:23:27):**  What sort of ailments do you personally tend to use fermented beverages and kombucha for?  
**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:23:33):**  You know I use it as more of a health practice on the day to day.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:23:38):**  I don't really think of it in my medicine cabinet.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:23:41):**  I think of it more in my like food pantry but it kind of straddles that line.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:23:46):**  So it's kind of like a maintenance thing.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:23:47):**  It's a maintenance thing and so I guess like tonic is a good word for it because it's like  
**[0:23:51-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:23:51):**  a strengthening beverage.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:23:54):**  So it strengthens digestion on the day to day.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:23:58):**  It can eventually help to reduce body inflammation especially if you're drinking it quite sour  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:24:05):**  like without residual sugar or with very little residual sugar.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:24:10):**  So I think of it as like a maintenance thing like eating your vegetables you know.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:24:17):**  So while like broccoli has a lot of benefits I wouldn't necessarily eat it specifically  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:24:21):**  to reduce breast cancer I'm eating it because that's what's for dinner.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:24:27):**  So kombucha same thing I drink it because it's delicious.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:24:30):**  It's a super good alternative to pop or juice or alcohol.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:24:35):**  So I like to have it around for those reasons and all of the health benefits are just for  
**[0:24:40-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:24:40):**  me they're totally a bonus.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:24:42):**  Absolutely like give me an idea of the sugar content of your average kombucha.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:24:47):**  I'm sure it probably varies fairly widely depending on how you make it and how long  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:24:50):**  you let it ferment but I know a lot of people are concerned about consuming too much especially  
**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:24:56):**  processed sugar though you did recommend cane sugar.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:25:00):**  What's the best way of cutting down on the sugar content?  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:25:06):**  It can have as little as I'm doing this off the top of my head so I'll have to check it  
**[0:25:10-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:25:10):**  but I think it's about 7 grams per glass per like 8 ounce glass which is about the same  
**[0:25:17-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:25:17):**  as carrot juice.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:25:19):**  So it never has no sugar there are some sugars which are not consumed but it can be quite  
**[0:25:25-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:25:25):**  low sugar if you ferment it to the point of vinegar it's low sugar like very low but most  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:25:33):**  people like it with a bit more sweetness to it especially if you put do secondary fermentation  
**[0:25:39-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:25:39):**  meaning you put a little extra sugar or fruit in the bottle to make it fizzier.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:25:44):**  So the best practice if you're going super super low sugar is to ferment it for 21 days  
**[0:25:49-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:25:49):**  you're going to have the lowest amount of sugar.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:25:52):**  Good to know.

**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:26:02):**  super sour some people can tolerate it some people take very small amounts of it like  
**[0:26:07-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:26:07):**  they would a vinegar so that's how you get the lowest sugar.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:26:12):**  I like to do it somewhere between I usually brew for about 10 days so I've got something

**[0:26:37-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:26:37):**  restaurants before so I am kind of a nerd for pairing with them like pairing different  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:26:44):**  flavors together in my beverages so I like to do a batch of pretty plain kombucha so  
**[0:26:49-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:26:49):**  that means I'm either green or black tea and I actually recently learned that you can use  
**[0:26:56-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:26:56):**  non caffeinated different types of herbs as well but most of my experience is with tea  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:27:02):**  so I'll do a batch of plain kombucha and then the fun flavors happen and secondary fermentation  
**[0:27:08-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:27:08):**  when you put it in the bottle so I've got one like I've got one in my book that is mango  
**[0:27:14-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:27:14):**  lassi and so it's like some crushed cardamom pods and some mango puree and you just put  
**[0:27:20-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:27:20):**  that in the bottom of the bottle and then fill it up with your green or black tea kombucha

**[0:28:14-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:28:14):**  some of the other ways that we can ferment drinks and the different types of probiotics  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:28:20):**  and ingredients that we can use to do that.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:28:23):**  Sure sure.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:28:24):**  So for different what types of cultures were you using to ferment that ginger thing that  
**[0:28:30-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:28:30):**  you just drank?  
**[0:28:31-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:28:31):**  Well so the specific one that we've been doing is a ginger bug.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:28:35):**  So we've been fermenting ginger with the wild yeast that are on the skin and we just keep  
**[0:28:41-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:28:41):**  it going kind of feeding it almost like a sourdough starter by putting in what they  
**[0:28:45-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:28:45):**  call here a panella which is just raw cane sugar in block form and then we we put some  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:28:51):**  of that in grate some new ginger into it and keep the bug going and then whenever we're  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:28:56):**  ready to make drinks then we'll do a huge batch of tea in this case we did hibiscus  
**[0:29:01-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:29:01):**  tea and added some some pinha pineapple rinds sorry sometimes I get confused with the Spanish  
**[0:29:10-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:29:10):**  and the English words here so we added pineapple rinds and and the sugar and then after all  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:29:16):**  of that boiled and cooled again then we added the ginger bug and usually within about two  
**[0:29:21-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:29:21):**  or three days it's it's fizzy already and we do a big batch that way.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:29:25):**  Nice yeah great so it sounds like you have a really healthy ginger bug.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:29:29):**  Yeah it's been going really well and we've tried a lot of different combinations but  
**[0:29:31-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:29:31):**  this hibiscus and pineapple one has been a real favorite.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:29:35):**  I'm totally gonna try that.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:29:37):**  So ginger bug is such a useful and easy to maintain culture like have you found that  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:29:43):**  you don't even you don't need to feed it very often you don't need to make batches very  
**[0:29:46-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:29:46):**  often for it to to thrive right?  
**[0:29:49-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:29:49):**  What I found is that the more often you feed it kind of the more sweet it comes out and  
**[0:29:52-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:29:52):**  if you let it to age without feeding it very often it tends to become more vinegary and  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:29:56):**  acidic which I mean you just sort of do to taste.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:30:00):**  Yeah yeah totally and it's much like a sourdough starter that way so if people have other experience  
**[0:30:05-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:30:05):**  with fermentation in terms of baking bread and things like that then they tend to have  
**[0:30:08-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:30:08):**  an idea about what we mean by feeding it.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:30:12):**  If you're totally a beginner though like I found that ginger beer out of a ginger bug  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:30:16):**  was actually a pretty easy project because you don't need to buy you don't need to like  
**[0:30:20-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:30:20):**  go find a scoby somewhere and start it.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:30:24):**  You could just start with organic ginger like you said just grating ginger and adding sugar  
**[0:30:27-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:30:27):**  and then waiting till it bubbles.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:30:30):**  So I love that as a beginner project for sure.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:30:33):**  Yeah I found it to be really low maintenance like very approachable to anyone I mean I  
**[0:30:37-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:30:37):**  know kombucha is as well but I've also heard of some others that are more involved processes.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:30:41):**  Could you talk about maybe some of the other ways or other ingredients you could use to  
**[0:30:45-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:30:45):**  get good fermented beverages started.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:30:48):**  Yeah so I mean fermented beverages are they're vast and so we've got like your beer and wine  
**[0:30:54-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:30:54):**  side but for my experience what I've been working on the last few years is more of the  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:31:01):**  less alcohol to no alcohol kind of ferments.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:31:05):**  So yeah the ginger beer and kombucha are super popular.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:31:10):**  Another one is water kefir.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:31:12):**  Have you seen water kefir grains before?  
**[0:31:14-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:31:14):**  I haven't no.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:31:16):**  Okay so this is this one's pretty great.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:31:20):**  The water kefir they're called kefir grains and so kefir or kefir is usually when people  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:31:26):**  say that they think of dairy or that yogurt drink.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:31:30):**  And that is another fermented beverage and it's actually unrelated to water kefir.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:31:36):**  So the dairy one looks kind of like cauliflower a little bit but it's gooey and soft and kind  
**[0:31:44-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:31:44):**  of all in one piece.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:31:45):**  And then the water kefir is made for fermenting a beverage kind of like sparkling lemonade.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:31:50):**  Like if you just did a plain water kefir it would taste like sparkling lemonade.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:31:56):**  The grains are translucent and kind of look like gravel and rather than augmenting their  
**[0:32:04-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:32:04):**  size when they grow they just reproduce in numbers.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:32:08):**  So you might get a few teaspoons more growth just by having more kind of gravelly bits.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:32:18):**  So I got my first few tablespoons of water kefir a number of years ago and it's a very  
**[0:32:24-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:32:24):**  different rhythm than what kombucha has.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:32:28):**  It's not difficult to take care of per se but it requires more frequent brewing to keep  
**[0:32:34-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:32:34):**  healthy.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:32:36):**  So I've had batches of grains and then had to give them up and then gotten some back  
**[0:32:41-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:32:41):**  and had to give them up just depending on what my schedule looks like.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:32:46):**  Right now I'm rich in water kefir grains.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:32:48):**  Someone just dropped a whole bunch off here and I'm taking care of them.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:32:51):**  Oh nice.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:32:52):**  So what kind of profile flavor wise does that give?  
**[0:32:57-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:32:57):**  So kombucha has more of a yeasty taste.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:33:01):**  Water kefir grains also are a bacteria and yeast scoby.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:33:07):**  It's also called a scoby even though it doesn't look like a kombucha one.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:33:10):**  It doesn't taste as yeasty though.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:33:12):**  So people find if they're turned off by the smell or like yeasty taste of kombucha sometimes

**[0:33:20-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:33:20):**  It's just very clean and sparkly.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:33:23):**  You don't use tea in it and so it's just sugar and water and you could optionally and I recommend  
**[0:33:29-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:33:29):**  you do put some other flavors in so after you brew it with a plain sugar and water you  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:33:33):**  can put in whatever flavors that you would for kombucha.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:33:37):**  So you could put in your berries or different types of juice or vegetable purees even like  
**[0:33:43-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:33:43):**  you could put carrot juice in there if you wanted to make a kind of veggie tonic one.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:33:48):**  So yeah and they become quite fizzy quite fast and they brew much faster than kombucha.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:33:55):**  Which is usually like seven to 10 days or more and water kefir is like two to five days.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:34:01):**  Oh yeah that's a quick turnaround.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:34:04):**  Yeah so if that fits the rhythm of you know your kitchen life then that might be fine  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:34:09):**  but you do have to brew them kind of sequentially like back to back.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:34:13):**  It doesn't really like being rested very often.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:34:16):**  So if you're you know working shift work or not in the house or taking a three month holiday  
**[0:34:21-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:34:21):**  you kind of have to like find a babysitter for it.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:34:24):**  Yeah yeah yeah.

**[0:34:36-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:34:36):**  you would recommend on getting started with your own fermented beverages.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:34:41):**  Sure they can get in touch with me.

**[0:34:52-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:34:52):**  And so including fermented beverage classes lots of fermented foods classes and then kind  
**[0:34:57-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:34:57):**  of a myriad of other healthy cooking classes and workshops.

**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:35:11):**  You know what I when I first started doing this resources were local and we formed kind  
**[0:35:16-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:35:16):**  of a little band of fermentation nerds that we called the culture club and we get together  
**[0:35:22-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:35:22):**  like once a month and do a little food swap.

**[0:35:30-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:35:30):**  it's nice to not feel alone in this and that you can just go learn from each other.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:35:36):**  So get hooked up with a local community if you have one.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:35:41):**  Sometimes there are closet fermenters even in small communities where you wouldn't expect  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:35:45):**  them but of course now there's online communities and that's really where a lot of people go  
**[0:35:50-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:35:50):**  to share information.

**[0:36:02-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:36:02):**  It's a Facebook group and it's not it's not managed by Sandro Katz who is the author of

**[0:36:13-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:36:13):**  And the admins are really on top of things in terms of they know their science.

**[0:36:26-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:36:26):**  fermentation practices that could be unsafe or unwise then they inform and let people  
**[0:36:31-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:36:31):**  know what's up.

**[0:36:39-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:36:39):**  their kitchens and stuff.

**[0:36:51-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:36:51):**  who brew for a living and actually like half kombucha companies and stuff.

**[0:37:15-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-diy-kombucha-and-the-delicious-world-of-fermented-drinks-with-author-andrea-potter-063/#t=0:37:15):**  of opinions within half an hour about what might be up.

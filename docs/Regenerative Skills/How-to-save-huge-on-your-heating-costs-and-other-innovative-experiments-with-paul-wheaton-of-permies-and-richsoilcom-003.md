**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to The Abundant Edge, the podcast that explores the worlds of natural  
**[0:00:05-0:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:00:05):**  building, permaculture, and regenerative living.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:00:07):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher and I have a great guest for you lined up today.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:00:12):**  Many of you probably know Paul Wheaton already as the founder of Permies and Richsoil.com  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:00:18):**  or from his TED Talk on how to save energy by heating your home in alternative ways.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:00:23):**  He's a giant who always wears overalls and is being called the Duke of Permaculture by  
**[0:00:28-0:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:00:28):**  Jeff Lawton, the bad boy of permaculture, and has a lot of other nicknames as well.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:00:34):**  He started out as a software engineer best known for working on the ground systems for  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:00:38):**  the spacecraft that take pictures for Google Earth.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:00:42):**  He's currently the largest voice for permaculture in the world with the forums on Permies.com  
**[0:00:48-0:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:00:48):**  attracting thousands of visitors every single day.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:00:51):**  We get into a ton of great topics in this interview, including rocket mass heaters,  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:00:57):**  a ton of creative ways to save energy from heating your home, and some of his more controversial  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:02):**  advice on how to set up a profitable permaculture farm.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:06):**  Now a quick disclaimer before we get started.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:09):**  My internet connection here in rural Guatemala still is not the best, so there might be a  
**[0:01:13-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:13):**  few times in the interview where the quality falls off, there's a little bit of distortion,  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:19):**  but I promise you if you keep listening there won't be any problems with understanding what  
**[0:01:23-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:23):**  he's trying to say.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:24):**  So stick with me, bear with me while I get my equipment and my connection fixed up a  
**[0:01:29-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:29):**  little bit here, and let's get started.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:32):**  Welcome Paul, thanks for being with me here today.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:44):**  How you doing?  
**[0:01:46-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:46):**  Hey, I've got a cold.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:49):**  I plan on coughing through this.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:51):**  Oh right.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:52):**  There's no way I'm going to edit that out, so let's keep doing it.  
**[0:01:56-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:56):**  All right, jumping right in.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:58):**  You have developed a very robust reputation in both the natural building and permaculture  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:02:03):**  communities for some bold ideas that have challenged what many of us are taught about  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:02:08):**  energy saving, gardening, indoor heating and more.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:02:12):**  What have been your most important experiments so far?  
**[0:02:16-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:02:16):**  My most important experiments.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:02:19):**  You know, this is going to sound like probably the dumbest experiment from the world of natural  
**[0:02:26-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:02:26):**  building, permaculture and all the other things, and I did something a few years ago.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:02:32):**  I happened to be in a scenario where I had electric heat, and I had a really hard time  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:02:38):**  convincing people of how heat works.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:02:43):**  And I did what I think was a ridiculously simple thing, and I've made videos of it  
**[0:02:51-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:02:51):**  and all kinds of articles and charts and proofs, and I called the article, How I Cut 87% Off  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:02:59):**  of My Electric Heat Bill, and the thing that makes it so important is that I can't get  
**[0:03:05-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:05):**  anybody to believe it.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:07):**  And it's like such a simple thing.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:11):**  In fact, the knowledge that it is true sits in your head right now, and all the people  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:18):**  who don't believe it, the knowledge that it's true is already in their head.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:24):**  And so let me turn the tables on you for just a second.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:27):**  I'm going to ask you a question.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:28):**  Why is an efficient light inefficient?  
**[0:03:34-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:34):**  Why is it inefficient?  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:35):**  Because it converts so much of its energy into heat.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:39):**  Into heat?  
**[0:03:41-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:41):**  You don't say!  
**[0:03:42-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:42):**  Into heat, really?  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:44):**  And now there are three kinds of heat.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:47):**  Do you know the three kinds of heat?  
**[0:03:52-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:52):**  Yeah, convection, conduction, and I always forget the third C.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:59):**  Radiant.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:00):**  What's the one?  
**[0:04:02-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:02):**  Radiant.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:03):**  Radiant.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:04):**  It's that C that is missing the bottom half.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:06):**  That's what it was.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:08):**  I was thinking of the wrong letter.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:10):**  Okay.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:11):**  So the thing is, is that convective heat is the least efficient form of heat, but it's  
**[0:04:16-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:16):**  also the kind of heat that most American homes use.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:19):**  Right.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:20):**  Heat all the air in the house and hope that it gets to some of the people.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:24):**  And then the light bulb uses radiant heat, which is a pretty efficient form of heat.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:29):**  And if you use it really in a very smart fashion, you'll heat people more than you'll heat all  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:37):**  this space in your home that no one's currently occupying.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:41):**  Sure.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:42):**  It takes a little bit of time.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:43):**  You've got to kind of audit where you're spending most of the time in your home so that you  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:47):**  can direct that heat to where you're going to be, right?  
**[0:04:51-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:51):**  Sure.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:52):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:53):**  Now, of course, you move the light close to you.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:57):**  You have it directed, you know, more of a directional light bulb than a general lighting  
**[0:05:03-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:03):**  kind of a thing.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:04):**  And you direct it at people, things of that nature.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:08):**  But the bottom line is, is that even if you're absolutely terrible at doing any of that,  
**[0:05:15-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:15):**  for whatever reason, then the amount of heat in your home, like if you're using electric  
**[0:05:22-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:22):**  heat, it's like if it's the middle of winter, let's say it's 20 degrees outside, and you've  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:30):**  got baseboard heats going.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:32):**  If you turn on 40 light bulbs in your house, and they don't add up to the amount of electricity  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:38):**  being used by your baseboard heat, which, by the way, is going to be warmer, then you're  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:44):**  still going to be, like the amount of time that the baseboard heat comes on now is going  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:50):**  to be a lot less because of all the heat given off by those light bulbs.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:54):**  The thermostat isn't going to trip as much.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:56):**  Right.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:57):**  It's almost, you know, if you're using the light bulbs, if all the light bulbs are behind  
**[0:06:01-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:01):**  some sort of block, then the amount of heat that they contribute to the space is going  
**[0:06:06-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:06):**  to be precisely the same.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:08):**  But if you allow them to do the radiant heat thing, then the thermostat will be set for  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:14):**  72, and you're going to be like way too warm because of all the lights that are on, and  
**[0:06:19-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:19):**  they're putting their radiant heat on you.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:21):**  So you'll naturally turn the thermostat down.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:23):**  You will be, and if you get really smart about this, and this is exactly what I demonstrated  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:27):**  in this thing, if you're really smart about this, you can cut your electric heat by 87%.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:33):**  87% isn't even a legit number because that's for the entire winter when I did a whole bunch  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:39):**  of experiments, and towards the end we'd optimize the system a lot.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:44):**  I think that if I did the whole experiment over again, I could get it down to like, I  
**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:48):**  cut the bill by 95%.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:50):**  Oh, that's some serious reduction there.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:55):**  But the thing that's bizarre is that I can't seem to get people to believe it, even though  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:03):**  the information is already in their head.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:07):**  Right, and I saw your TED Talk too.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:09):**  You go into a lot more detail and explain how this works with visual aids and stuff.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:13):**  So for anybody who's looking for more clarity on this issue, you can search for Paul Wheaton  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:18):**  and TED Talk, and you'll come up with everything he's talking about here.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:22):**  So you asked me about the experiments that I've done that are the most important, and  
**[0:07:26-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:26):**  I've done, my life is all about experimentation.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:29):**  I've done so many experiments.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:32):**  I kind of feel like if I'm allowed one idea to convey to all people in the world in order  
**[0:07:41-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:41):**  to solve the world's problems, I think I would go with that one because that would have the  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:49):**  most positive impact globally.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:52):**  I mean, I've got experiments with rocket mosquitoes, with the wafatis, with all kinds of horticultural  
**[0:07:58-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:58):**  endeavors like the hulu culture stuff and replacing irrigation with permaculture, all  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:05):**  kinds, I mean, the list is massive and long, and I've got so much to say on so many different  
**[0:08:10-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:10):**  topics.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:11):**  But you asked me which one was the most important, and it's that one.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:13):**  It's kind of like, it's also really profound, the secondary experiment, which is the unfortunate  
**[0:08:21-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:21):**  experiment, it's so profound how people will know it's true, but they just can't let it  
**[0:08:27-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:27):**  into their head.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:28):**  Yeah, yeah, certainly.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:29):**  And I don't know what more you could do with all the different material that you published  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:34):**  out there to help to convey exactly how simple this kind of stuff is to implement, especially  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:40):**  in a country like the United States.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:44):**  But hey, maybe some more people listening to this will pick up on the information and  
**[0:08:48-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:48):**  start to implement it themselves.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:51):**  I hope that someday somebody famous will carry it, or maybe somebody can just have a way  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:57):**  of presenting it that works its way into brains better than what I've presented today.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:03):**  Hey, we'll throw down the gauntlet and see if somebody can pick that up.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:07):**  All right, so moving on, you mentioned a ton of other experiments that you've been working  
**[0:09:12-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:12):**  on other than just the heating.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:14):**  How have those experiments been received by the permaculture and natural building communities?  
**[0:09:19-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:19):**  I know you just talked about that one that hasn't really been picked up.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:22):**  Have there been others that have been really well adopted?  
**[0:09:27-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:27):**  I think hoover culture has probably been the one that's been most adopted.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:30):**  And hoover culture is not my creation or invention.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:36):**  It is something that I think I might be the most famous for hoover culture.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:46):**  When I went to write an article about hoover culture on the internet, there was nothing  
**[0:09:52-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:52):**  on the internet about hoover culture, zero.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:56):**  So I wrote the first hoover culture article on the internet, but I don't want anybody  
**[0:10:03-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:03):**  to start thinking that I invented it or anything like that.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:05):**  No, it's nothing like that.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:06):**  I've heard about it and I did a lot of experimenting with it and I've evolved my theories and I've  
**[0:10:13-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:13):**  projected those.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:15):**  And now I see a lot of stuff on the internet about hoover culture.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:18):**  I'm feeling a lot like, no, you're doing it wrong.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:24):**  No, you're doing it that way.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:28):**  So that's probably the thing where I've put a lot of work into that has gotten the most  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:35):**  traction with permaculture people.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:39):**  With natural builders, I think, again, rocket mass heaters is something that I did not invent.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:50):**  That's the work of Ianto Evans.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:52):**  I've done some of the newer innovation behind it.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:57):**  So I think pebble style rocket mass heaters are my creation.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:01):**  And there's a couple of variations of rocket mass heaters that are mine.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:07):**  I think my work in that area is more about trying to get the word out there.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:15):**  I'm pretty sure I put up the very first video on YouTube about it.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:19):**  I think I wrote the first article on the internet about it, stuff like that.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:24):**  And the world of natural building, that's rocket mass heaters.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:29):**  My work within the world of rocket mass heaters is probably what's gotten the most traction  
**[0:11:32-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:32):**  within the world of natural builders.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:34):**  I started to learn about hoover culture and rocket mass heaters from some of your articles,  
**[0:11:41-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:41):**  but I did later work with Ianto directly.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:44):**  And funny enough, now that I'm here in Guatemala, one of his original inventions, like back  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:49):**  in the 70s for stoves, the Lorena stoves, are actually pretty widely used in the comodores  
**[0:11:54-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:54):**  and the markets around here.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:57):**  So I'm actually doing some advanced work on rocket stoves and rocket ovens recently.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:05):**  And it's kind of interesting to be spreading some more stove information from the guy who  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:09):**  was here like 30, 40 years ago.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:13):**  Pretty full circle in that way.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:15):**  So before we move on, can you go over very briefly what a rocket stove is and what a  
**[0:12:21-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:21):**  hoover culture bed is, for those who don't already know?  
**[0:12:24-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:24):**  Okay, so hoover culture is basically soil on wood.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:30):**  If you build a pile tall enough, which is generally about six or seven feet tall, then  
**[0:12:35-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:35):**  you don't have to irrigate it anymore.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:37):**  And some people are kind of like, oh, well the neighbors think, and so they build something  
**[0:12:40-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:40):**  only two or three feet tall.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:46):**  I could fill probably six hours of discussion about hoover culture and the finer points,  
**[0:12:52-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:52):**  but in general, soil on wood in a mound, and you plant all your favorite gardening plants  
**[0:12:58-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:58):**  on there.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:13:00):**  You then have less, you can reduce your irrigation worries to zero.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:13:07):**  Then there comes all this stuff about you don't have to worry so much about fertilizer  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:13:11):**  or pest control or all these other things, your gardening.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:13:15):**  In fact, with the permaculture promise that comes with hoover culture is that if you do  
**[0:13:20-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:13:20):**  a really good job, you won't have to do anything but harvest.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:13:28):**  Rocket stoves and rocket mass heaters, I want to make it really clear that there's a differentiation,  
**[0:13:34-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:13:34):**  and it has to do with how some people, I said something one time and somebody made it into  
**[0:13:42-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:13:42):**  a lovely graphic.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:13:44):**  I said somebody was choosing to not understand the difference between a rocket stove and  
**[0:13:50-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:13:50):**  a rocket mass heater.  
**[0:13:51-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:13:51):**  They were intentionally swapping the terms to prove that neither worked because they  
**[0:14:00-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:00):**  refused to glom onto the terms.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:03):**  They're kind of like, well, you're going to have all this smoke.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:07):**  You say you're going to heat your home with one-tenth of the wood, but then you have all  
**[0:14:11-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:11):**  this smoke in your house.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:14):**  You're thinking of trying to use a cook stove that's intended for outdoor use inside your  
**[0:14:19-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:19):**  home.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:21):**  I'm trying to talk about using a rocket.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:23):**  Anyway, I said this thing about, okay, you know what?  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:26):**  You have to be this smart to ride this ride.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:31):**  You don't get to ride.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:34):**  This is for other people, not you.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:38):**  There's this great graphic that this guy made where it's got me in a lab coat.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:43):**  At the top of the chart, of course, is Albert Einstein.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:45):**  At the bottom of the chart is a goldfish.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:48):**  I'm holding my hand up to about 25 percent of the way up the chart.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:53):**  You must be this smart to ride this ride.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:56):**  So a rocket stove, when an American talks about a rocket stove, you're talking about  
**[0:15:05-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:05):**  a camping stove, a contraption that will cook your food with just a few twigs.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:11):**  It will generate smoke.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:13):**  It just directs the heat very efficiently.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:17):**  It's much better than an open fire or something like that.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:20):**  You use a lot less fuel.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:21):**  You don't have to pack up.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:23):**  They used to use white gas to pack it up with you.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:27):**  You'd have this little teeny tiny cook stove that would run on the white gas.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:32):**  Instead, you could just use twigs that are lying around.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:36):**  It will work extremely well.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:39):**  But it's for outdoor use.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:42):**  Now where you're at in Guatemala and throughout Africa, South America, and a lot of third  
**[0:15:48-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:48):**  world nations, Asia, then some people it's like it's their culture to have basically  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:57):**  an open fire inside their house and it's all smoky inside.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:03):**  That's their thing.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:05):**  That's what they're into.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:06):**  In fact, Ianto has a wonderful story about his first time, I believe it was in Africa,  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:15):**  and he thought he was saving the world and he brought them solar ovens.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:18):**  He came back three months later and all the solar ovens were gone, but everybody sported  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:23):**  some really shiny jewelry.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:29):**  He says it wasn't a cultural fit.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:31):**  They burned wood and they're home to cook.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:33):**  That's what they do.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:34):**  Now, then he brings in the rocket stove and they start cooking with that.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:41):**  It cooks their food with one-tenth the wood and there's hardly any smoke inside the house.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:48):**  This one place in a village has this and what happened was that the woman next door will  
**[0:16:57-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:57):**  go to her guy and say, hey, you're going to get me one of those.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:17:03):**  Yeah, that's how it catches on.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:17:07):**  As opposed to a rocket mass heater where Ianto comes back to the United States and he's kind  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:17:13):**  of like, these wars that are fighting are over energy.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:17:18):**  All this pollution that's all over the place is tied to energy and the number one energy  
**[0:17:25-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:17:25):**  thing in the United States.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:17:27):**  Here's another thing that people just can't seem to understand.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:17:32):**  The number one energy consumer is heat, home heat, number one.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:17:41):**  In fact, if you switch from electric heat to a rocket mass heater, that reduces your  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:17:48):**  carbon footprint as much as parking seven cars.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:17:53):**  Everybody's all focused on cars.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:17:59):**  There's a lot of work to be done in there.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:01):**  There's a lot.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:02):**  It's like, oh, my carbon footprint, I'm going to get a Tesla.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:06):**  It's like you could do seven times more than that if you just switch from electric heat  
**[0:18:13-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:13):**  to a rocket mass heater.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:15):**  A rocket mass heater.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:17):**  First of all, all the exhaust is routed outside.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:21):**  You don't just build a fire in the middle of your living room.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:26):**  Something like that.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:28):**  It's got the same innards of a rocket stove.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:31):**  This is Ianto's invention.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:32):**  He took rocket stove technology and he made something that was extremely cheap and easy  
**[0:18:39-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:39):**  to make.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:40):**  It routed all the exhaust outside so it's good for Americans.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:47):**  You heat your home with one tenth the wood of a container of smoke.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:53):**  You would think that by burning one tenth of the wood, you would have one tenth of the  
**[0:18:56-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:56):**  smoke but it's actually closer to one one hundredth, one one thousandth of the smoke.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:03):**  Those are some statistics people can get on board with.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:06):**  So now I'm in Montana.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:09):**  We've had snow on the ground for the last month, maybe more than a month without a day  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:18):**  off.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:20):**  It's been cold.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:21):**  It's gotten below zero and I think we're going to finish up the winter having heated this  
**[0:19:27-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:27):**  place with only half a cord of wood.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:34):**  This same place with conventional wood stove would be burning six cords of wood.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:39):**  Hey, hang on one second.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:42):**  We've got the dogs going crazy over here.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:44):**  I'll be right back with you.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:47):**  The challenge of doing a podcast when there are nine dogs on the property.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:55):**  It's no small amount.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:58):**  So my next question then was, I know that one of the biggest innovations in the reduction  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:20:03):**  on heating costs and energy has been the home rocket mass heater like you talked about.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:20:08):**  You've actually got an entire DVD series on how to build them.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:20:13):**  So you've talked about the statistics and how it can actually reduce your heat bill,  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:20:18):**  cut down on the amount of energy that you use, generally good for the environment.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:20:23):**  What sort of materials do you need and is this something that's approachable for the  
**[0:20:28-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:20:28):**  lay person to make themselves?  
**[0:20:31-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:20:31):**  Well we're trying to make it better and better and better every passing year for people to  
**[0:20:37-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:20:37):**  do it.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:20:38):**  So we kind of came up with this term we call it the DIY level.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:20:41):**  So how much DIY skill do you need to have to build a rocket mass heater?  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:20:46):**  And we are, with each year we're finding ways to reduce that more and more.  
**[0:20:52-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:20:52):**  A big thing we're doing now is we're pushing, like one of the DVDs from the new DVD set  
**[0:21:01-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:01):**  is all about shippable cores.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:03):**  And so we're trying to encourage people to start businesses of building shippable cores  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:08):**  and then shipping them to people who want to build a rocket mass heater because with  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:13):**  the shippable core the rest of it becomes really, really simple, really easy.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:19):**  It's the core that's challenging.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:26):**  Through the DVD set, I mean we explore a lot of different rocket mass heaters built in  
**[0:21:32-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:32):**  a lot of different ways.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:34):**  We've got the basic, the plain basic simple ways.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:39):**  We've got stuff that uses some new materials that have been making rocket mass heaters  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:46):**  rocketier and cleaner.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:51):**  There's people out there that have built a rocket mass heater using just 20 bucks and  
**[0:21:56-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:56):**  scrounged farts.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:59):**  And then there's people that want to go first class all the way and they build some magnificent,  
**[0:22:04-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:22:04):**  beautiful thing for like $2,000.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:22:05):**  So the answer to your question…  
**[0:22:08-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:22:08):**  There's a lot of opportunity to scale it up is what you're talking about.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:22:16):**  I guess it's going to depend, I mean what we want to do is show people a lot of the  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:22:22):**  different things that have been done and then people choose for themselves which path is  
**[0:22:27-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:22:27):**  best for their situation.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:22:29):**  Okay, so they have some options to work with.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:22:33):**  I think that the most popular route is to build a cob style rocket mass heater.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:22:40):**  So this is where you're going to use clay, sand and sometimes straw for most of the structure.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:22:48):**  And I don't know about, I've been to so many different properties where some people  
**[0:22:55-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:22:55):**  have clay, some people have sand, some people don't have either.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:22:58):**  I happen to be in a place where I have both for free.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:01):**  All I want, oodles of it, mountains of it, literally, rocky mountains full of it.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:08):**  And I could build hundreds of cob homes and thousands of rocket mass heaters with the  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:14):**  clay and sand that I have at no cost.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:18):**  But like Ianto, he's got clay but he doesn't have sand.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:22):**  Yup, we've had some imported there when I've worked there in the past.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:27):**  A dump truck comes, drops off sand and then you, Oliver, are set up with a wheelbarrow  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:34):**  and you go up and down that little path like 40 times with wheelbarrow loads of sand.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:40):**  Well, I'll tell you what I was doing earlier today.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:43):**  I'm building a rocket oven for a client, one of the neighbors here in Guatemala.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:48):**  And they have a really small property but they only have a place where you can really  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:51):**  dig.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:52):**  And so we've been hauling bags of both clay and sand strapped with lassos on our heads  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:58):**  and the bags on our back and hiking them up the mountain.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:24:02):**  So that's the other option.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:24:05):**  And I think you're going to lose a lot of your eco points once you start doing that.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:24:09):**  As long as it's people, we're not burning a lot of fuel.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:24:12):**  And it's not that long of a walk but it is quite a bit uphill and it's on a road that  
**[0:24:18-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:24:18):**  machines can't get to.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:24:19):**  Luckily all the sand comes from the nearby riverbed which is replenished every year because  
**[0:24:26-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:24:26):**  we're in the mountains and rocks and sand just fall down.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:24:29):**  And clay soil is also close by.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:24:32):**  But when you're walking it, it does feel a little bit further.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:24:43):**  I think that you end up with something, when you pack stuff in like that and you make anything,  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:24:51):**  whatever it is that you're making, then it ends up being more beautiful because clearly  
**[0:24:57-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:24:57):**  you kind of look around like where do they get these materials?  
**[0:25:00-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:00):**  Did they pack that in here?  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:03):**  Then it does have more value.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:06):**  But on the other hand when you're trying to talk to somebody about like, yeah there's  
**[0:25:10-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:10):**  a guy that built one for 20 bucks, then it's kind of like people are quick to dismiss the  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:17):**  idea if they're thinking that they're going to, like the only way to do it is that they're  
**[0:25:22-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:22):**  going to have to get a big packet of sand and somehow strap it to their forehead to  
**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:28):**  carry it up a mountainside which seems to come up.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:33):**  You don't live on a mountain.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:34):**  Yeah but I heard the thing.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:36):**  The guy was packing it up with a strap on his head.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:43):**  People don't take so many circumstances into account when they see these really low prices  
**[0:25:48-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:48):**  from certain projects and they're like, oh well certainly everything that I'm doing is  
**[0:25:52-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:52):**  exactly the same as that project.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:54):**  It has to cost the same amount.  
**[0:25:56-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:56):**  Variables, variables, variables.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:58):**  I can't say that's definitely enough.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:02):**  I've seen so many straw bale houses built where the straw came from 1500 miles away.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:09):**  Oh yeah.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:10):**  The semi-truck delivered it.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:13):**  It's like okay so maybe you should have done something that's, it's like Art Ludwig has  
**[0:26:22-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:22):**  that article, can a 4,000 square foot home be green?  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:29):**  My response to that was is like yeah you've got a dozen people living in it.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:33):**  And then I actually recorded a podcast with Art where we kind of, and he was like, oh  
**[0:26:38-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:38):**  he still thinks it won't be green.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:41):**  And then on top of that, a lot of people are like my house is green and it's like they've  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:47):**  kind of cheated in so many different ways.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:51):**  I think a lot of it is that you build a home with the materials that you have either on  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:56):**  site or really close by.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:27:00):**  So a straw bale home makes great sense if you're out in a big prairie where there's  
**[0:27:07-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:27:07):**  a lot of grasses growing.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:27:09):**  Then straw bales are a smart thing there.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:27:13):**  But if you're hundreds of miles away from the nearest straw field then it's kind of  
**[0:27:20-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:27:20):**  like, I think that's not going to be an optimal fit.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:27:27):**  Sure, but one of the things you have to keep in mind is like depending on the climate,  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:27:32):**  thermal mass is going to offer a whole lot more problems and maybe you're going to  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:27:37):**  lose all the eco points for having the materials come from straight up on site when you're  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:27:43):**  trying to heat it in a really cold climate and that thermal mass is just not keeping  
**[0:27:48-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:27:48):**  anything out.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:27:50):**  So you've got to balance both sides in any of these projects.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:27:55):**  I know exactly what you're talking about but there are always other aspects to consider.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:00):**  There are.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:01):**  Oh, there are.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:02):**  There are.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:03):**  Which is why my job is always fun because I help coach people through these decisions  
**[0:28:07-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:07):**  for both their gardens and their buildings and no two sites are the same so I never get  
**[0:28:13-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:13):**  bored.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:14):**  Well, I think one thing is that if you've got something that's a strong success in  
**[0:28:19-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:19):**  an area then the neighbors oftentimes will rubber stamp that.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:25):**  Sure.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:26):**  They'll try to build something that's almost exactly the same and so you've got to  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:30):**  be careful about what you create because next thing you know you've got 15 other people  
**[0:28:36-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:36):**  that are having all this straw bale stuff imported.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:39):**  Sure.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:40):**  Especially the way these online communities work, somebody comes up with a new idea that  
**[0:28:46-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:46):**  worked really well for where they are and everybody tries to implement it wherever they  
**[0:28:50-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:50):**  happen to be.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:51):**  Again, not taking into consideration why it worked in that place and what might be a problem  
**[0:28:57-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:57):**  where they are.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:59):**  And they're going to learn.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:00):**  I like how it…  
**[0:29:01-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:01):**  And it fills your forums.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:02):**  What's that?  
**[0:29:03-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:03):**  And it fills your forums, the results of all this.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:07):**  Well, yes, it does fill the forums and our forums are packed.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:13):**  And I think that we've done a really good job of qualifying a lot of this stuff and  
**[0:29:22-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:22):**  we encourage people to point out all of the little flaws and stuff and to question things.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:28):**  However, you know, question it respectfully.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:31):**  Sure.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:32):**  So we've got quite a bit of rules but I think that you look at most of these projects  
**[0:29:38-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:38):**  and you're going to find a lot of discussion back and forth on these very topics where  
**[0:29:41-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:41):**  it's going to be kind of like, okay, well, why did you choose to use a straw bale when  
**[0:29:46-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:46):**  you're so far away from where straw bales come from?  
**[0:29:50-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:51):**  You know, and I think people are pretty good at answering those questions and I mean there's  
**[0:29:58-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:58):**  a lot of amazing projects that you can see.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:01):**  And the fun thing is there's no right answer.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:03):**  There's, you know, a lot of it is personal and a lot of it is based on what has worked  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:08):**  for other people, what, you know, needs to be taken account for your site and it really  
**[0:30:13-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:13):**  keeps for live discussions on there.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:16):**  Well, and things are changing too.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:18):**  All the time.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:19):**  And it's the change that I'm the most interested in to see what we're coming up with next.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:27):**  So so many people are really married to the stuff that was figured out 30 years ago.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:33):**  And it's like we've come so far since then.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:36):**  Oh, I have so many stories about that.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:40):**  It's like, you know, I think the Earthship might, you know, 30 years ago I was so in  
**[0:30:47-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:47):**  love with the Earthship.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:48):**  My Earthship book was so tattered.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:51):**  And when the guy said, you know what, because somebody asked the question like, well, what  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:55):**  if a spring pops up in the middle of my Earthship?  
**[0:30:59-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:59):**  And I thought, ooh, that's a tough one.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:01):**  And the guy's answer was so awesome.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:04):**  It's like, now you have a water feature right in your home.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:09):**  I was kind of thinking like, yeah, you can totally make that work.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:13):**  That would be cool.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:14):**  Now, after the coolness, my head wore off.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:18):**  The next problem that comes up years later, I figured out that it brings another kind  
**[0:31:24-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:24):**  of coolness.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:25):**  The water, the temperature of that water is going to be 45 degrees.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:29):**  That's going to be cooling the inside of your house a lot.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:32):**  Yeah, how can you route that cooling to be effective in other spaces?  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:38):**  How can you make that cooling work for you in the wintertime?  
**[0:31:42-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:42):**  That's a tough one.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:44):**  Sure.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:45):**  But, okay, and now here we are 30 years later and for every person that is in love with  
**[0:31:54-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:54):**  it, in love with the idea of building an Earthship, there's, I don't know, I'm doing the numbers  
**[0:32:01-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:01):**  all wrong.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:02):**  For every person who's actually built an Earthship, there's probably 100 people that are in love  
**[0:32:05-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:05):**  with the idea of it.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:06):**  For every person that's probably built an Earthship and likes it, there's probably at  
**[0:32:11-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:11):**  least one person who's built one and has decided no thank you.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:17):**  I think that Earthships bring us so, so much as ideas, but I think that they're not working  
**[0:32:25-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:25):**  out as well as the dreamers would like them to work out.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:31):**  I've heard that from a lot of people and I used to work in a community right next to  
**[0:32:35-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:35):**  the original Earthship community in Taos, New Mexico.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:38):**  There were a lot of bird-hounds from that community who had gone to other types of buildings  
**[0:32:44-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:44):**  and obviously that doesn't mean scrap the idea, throw the baby out with the bathwater.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:49):**  There's tons of great innovations that came out of that, but I can deal with you there.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:53):**  There have been a lot of new innovations since then as well that we can compound on, that  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:59):**  we can move past and even improve on those originals.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:04):**  I agree.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:05):**  I agree.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:06):**  All right.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:07):**  I can't remember what the question was.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:09):**  Did I answer it?  
**[0:33:10-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:10):**  I think you did.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:11):**  I think you might have answered some other ones accidentally, so we're doing really good.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:14):**  While we're on the topic of the forums at permes.com, they've undeniably become the  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:21):**  biggest single discussion ground for all things pertaining to regenerative and sustainable  
**[0:33:25-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:25):**  living.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:26):**  Why do you think it's so important to foster these forums and to give people space to contribute  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:31):**  ideas and their own experiments?  
**[0:33:35-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:35):**  I actually didn't think the forums would get to be this big, but what I did do is that  
**[0:33:43-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:43):**  I went out to forums to try and find discussion on the things that I wanted to talk about  
**[0:33:51-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:51):**  and I really couldn't get traction anywhere.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:55):**  I'd go some place and it would turn political or I'd go some other place and then they were  
**[0:34:01-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:01):**  like if you're not using Roundup, you're not farming.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:06):**  There was all kinds of stuff that didn't work.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:08):**  One of them was like Americans are all stupid, so piss off.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:15):**  I finally ended up thinking like, okay, I just want to talk about this stuff, so I created  
**[0:34:20-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:20):**  my own forums so that I could talk about the things I want to talk about, the way that  
**[0:34:25-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:25):**  I want to talk about them.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:27):**  I kind of feel like it's one place on the internet.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:31):**  It's not the place.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:33):**  It's one place.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:39):**  A lot of people are very angry.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:41):**  They're like, oh, you won't let me talk about how I hate people that are not vegans or you  
**[0:34:51-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:51):**  won't let me hate on that other group or you won't... censorship, and I want to say censorship  
**[0:34:59-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:59):**  is my life.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:35:00):**  That's what I'm going to do.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:35:01):**  I'm going to censor anything I don't like.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:35:06):**  Mysteriously, it's going to be this massive site and I think we've stumbled onto a recipe  
**[0:35:12-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:35:12):**  that works for a lot of people.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:35:15):**  There's a lot of people out there that want to talk about the things that I want to talk  
**[0:35:18-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:35:18):**  about the way I want to talk about it.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:35:20):**  It's just gotten huge.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:35:24):**  Now I get people telling me that I have to let them post their hate speech because I  
**[0:35:30-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:35:30):**  have a responsibility since it's grown to be the largest community.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:35:34):**  It's like, no, I'm still not going to do that.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:35:36):**  I'm going to be selfish and weird and whatever.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:35:43):**  Now it's huge and we have, I think, 150 forums, something like that.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:35:51):**  I know that they've... It's just in the last couple of days.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:35:54):**  What?  
**[0:35:55-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:35:55):**  Is it all the different topics?  
**[0:35:56-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:35:56):**  People just open up a topic whenever they've got questions or something that they want  
**[0:36:02-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:36:02):**  to post?  
**[0:36:03-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:36:03):**  Is that how that works?  
**[0:36:04-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:36:04):**  I'm not sure, but I think we might have almost 500,000 threads.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:36:09):**  Each thread would be a topic.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:36:11):**  Oh, okay.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:36:12):**  They're categorized into about 150 different forums.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:36:19):**  One forum might have a thousand threads in it.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:36:26):**  We've got a forum that's just about rocket stoves and another forum that's just about  
**[0:36:32-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:36:32):**  rocket mass heaters and another forum that's about wood burning stoves, so people that  
**[0:36:38-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:36:38):**  are using more conventional wood stoves.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:36:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:36:41):**  I've seen a lot of those.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:36:43):**  There's a lot of people with some really passionate ideas on all of that stuff.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:36:46):**  It's always fun.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:36:47):**  Oh, yeah.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:36:48):**  In the world of rocket mass heaters, I'm a powerful advocate against using metal inside  
**[0:36:55-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:36:55):**  the wood feed, the burn tunnel, and the riser.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:01):**  There's a group of people that are very adamant that it's totally cool to do that, and so  
**[0:37:07-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:07):**  they do that.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:08):**  I allow it to be posted on my site even though I don't care for it, and I do believe that  
**[0:37:15-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:15):**  we are seeing a lot of innovation every year in the world of rocket mass heaters.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:19):**  Well, good, because I've got some new ideas about what I'm doing with ovens here.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:24):**  I'm really interested to hear your feedback on that sometime soon.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:29):**  I'll have to send you a link.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:31):**  I want to say use a J-tube.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:33):**  Oh, way ahead of you, J-tube.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:37):**  Done.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:38):**  That's cool.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:39):**  That gravity feed, you can't beat it.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:41):**  You can't beat that gravity feed.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:44):**  The gravity feed is such a smart way to go in so many ways, and there's arguments for  
**[0:37:51-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:51):**  the L-tube and the J-tube, and now there's batch box out there.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:56-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:56):**  I've used both.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:57):**  I really have, and I'm with you on the J-tube thing.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:04):**  Batch box always ends up that they don't put the damn door on it, and then you've got to  
**[0:38:10-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:10):**  figure out the door.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:11):**  It's like, all right, I made you a batch box.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:13):**  It's like, it's a beautiful system, so much better than a J-tube.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:18):**  Oh, look at the time.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:19):**  I got to go home.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:21):**  Bye now.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:22):**  Good luck with that.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:24):**  Half baked idea there.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:26):**  It's the door that's the issue.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:28):**  It's like if you don't design the door in from the very beginning, the whole thing is  
**[0:38:33-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:33):**  a festering turd, and it sucks, and it doesn't work the way it needs to work.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:40):**  It's a mess, but then a J-tube, it's like when it comes time to put the door on it,  
**[0:38:47-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:47):**  it's like, oy, there you put two fire bricks right there, and you're done.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:52):**  It took about what, seven seconds to put the door on that.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:56):**  That's a little bit easier too.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:39:00):**  I've seen a lot of people doing, so rocket ovens and indoor wood cook stoves are the,  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:39:10):**  I want to say like, orange is the new black or something, but indoor wood cook stoves,  
**[0:39:15-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:39:15):**  the rocket technology is the fashion for 2017.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:39:20):**  It's like we're seeing so many designs, and so many really beautiful ones.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:39:26):**  We have three of them here now that are just amazing, and each by a different artist.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:39:35):**  In fact, I think two of them are actually batch box systems, but they built the door  
**[0:39:41-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:39:41):**  from the very beginning.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:39:44):**  Of course, we've got all kinds of welding gear, and the people who built them had expertise  
**[0:39:50-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:39:50):**  in welding.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:39:51):**  A lot of people, they don't have that expertise, and so then it's like the J-tube is really  
**[0:39:58-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:39:58):**  the way to go.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:39:59):**  Ease of use, yeah, I agree.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:02):**  Yeah, the batch box has some great perks, but that door thing, you would think, oh,  
**[0:40:10-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:10):**  it's so simple.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:11):**  I mean, we can all imagine a door.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:12):**  It's so easy.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:13):**  There's nothing to it.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:15):**  You're trying to get steel to meet masonry, and by the way, you have to design it in such  
**[0:40:22-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:22):**  a way that the fire doesn't melt the steel.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:26):**  Now, you asked earlier about what is a rocket mass heater, and the big difference between  
**[0:40:32-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:32):**  a conventional wood stove and a rocket mass heater is that with a conventional wood stove,  
**[0:40:37-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:37):**  you've got a fire and a metal box, and you're trying to get the heat in the room just as  
**[0:40:42-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:42):**  fast as you can.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:45):**  The heat from the fire goes into the room, and then whatever's left goes up the chimney.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:50):**  With a rocket mass heater, we don't let the heat into the room in the beginning.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:57):**  We burn the fire in an insulated space, so that way it gets hotter, hotter, hotter, hotter,  
**[0:41:05-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:41:05):**  hotter, and we get to a temperature that is far hotter than what you could ever possibly  
**[0:41:10-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:41:10):**  have in a conventional wood stove.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:41:12):**  This burns all the creosote and all the smoke, so you get a much cleaner burn.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:41:18):**  Plus, now it's moving in a strong direction, and then we harvest the heat from it.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:41:29):**  That's the big difference.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:41:30):**  Yeah, that's the key stuff.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:41:31):**  You're trying to do something with steel, and it's near where it's supposed to get hot.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:41:40):**  The temperatures we're shooting for are like 3,000 degrees or so, and steel is liquid at  
**[0:41:45-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:41:45):**  2,600, so then it doesn't hold up so good.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:41:50):**  Now, if you've got a conventional wood stove, generally your fire tops out at 1,200, 1,300  
**[0:41:56-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:41:56):**  degrees at a conventional wood stove, so the hottest you'll ever see is you'll start to  
**[0:42:01-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:01):**  see the steel glow a little bit, but that's it.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:05):**  That's as hot as it gets.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:06):**  But in a rocket mass heater, we're going to melt it.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:11):**  You can't actually melt that steel out, yeah.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:14):**  There's been a lot of YouTube videos where people are like, rocket mass heaters suck  
**[0:42:18-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:18):**  because it all melted, and they're showing video of the inside where it all melted away,  
**[0:42:24-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:24):**  and it's like, yeah, don't put metal there.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:26):**  Yeah, don't do that.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:28):**  That could be a good idea.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:30):**  No, I've been using mostly bricks, just exclusively bricks lately, and a mix of lime and cement  
**[0:42:38-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:38):**  that holds up a lot better against heat.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:41):**  Are you using Portland cement?  
**[0:42:45-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:45):**  Very small amounts, but for anything that's touching the burn tube.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:50):**  So let me just ask, Portland cement will fall at 600 degrees.  
**[0:42:56-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:56):**  Right.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:57):**  Wherever you use Portland cement, make sure it's an area that won't get above 600 degrees.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:02):**  So right next to the burny bits, no Portland cement.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:07):**  You can use cob.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:08):**  Cob will be fine because that's just sand and clay.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:11):**  Clay doesn't liquefy until something like 4,000 degrees.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:19):**  And sand generally doesn't liquefy until something past 2,000, but when it's with the clay, the  
**[0:43:27-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:27):**  clay tends to protect it.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:29):**  We've done a lot of stuff where we've made stuff with a mixture of clay and perlite,  
**[0:43:33-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:33):**  and perlite is a type of puffed rock, and it will liquefy, I believe, at, oh man, I  
**[0:43:42-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:42):**  think it puffs at 1,400 and it melts at 2,400.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:46):**  It becomes liquid at 2,400.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:47):**  We've had a lot of systems where we put that in there, and we'll pull out gobs of perlite  
**[0:43:53-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:53):**  glass after a burn a couple weeks later.  
**[0:43:56-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:56):**  Oh wow.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:57):**  And so what we've figured out is happening is that where the hot area is, that the perlite  
**[0:44:04-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:04):**  there melts, but then the clay will protect the perlite that's further away.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:10):**  Interesting.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:12):**  But I'm even moving away from the use of perlite in my systems, other than in an area where  
**[0:44:21-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:21):**  it won't get very hot.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:23):**  But for the cores, I'm not using it.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:27):**  Now for brick, you've got to be careful, I mean if you can get a brick that is definitely  
**[0:44:32-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:32):**  a clay brick, then that's fine.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:36):**  And then of course fire brick, actual fire brick is fine, but most brick today is actually  
**[0:44:43-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:43):**  a product of Portland cement.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:46):**  And you've got to keep in mind that, hey, we're all eco-conscious.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:51):**  Portland cement has a massive carbon footprint.  
**[0:44:54-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:54):**  I think of all the industrialized stuff of everything, even caused, I believe one third  
**[0:45:04-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:04):**  of that carbon footprint is the manufacture of Portland cement.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:08):**  Wow, that's quite a statistic.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:11):**  I don't know where, I've heard a different statistic, but it's up there for sure.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:15):**  Right.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:16):**  I mean the carbon footprint is more than just what humans create.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:20):**  Definitely.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:21):**  But still, of what humans have created, the last statistic I saw on it was one third is  
**[0:45:31-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:31):**  the manufacture of Portland cement.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:32):**  Well, it's always worth keeping in mind when you're doing build projects of any kind.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:38):**  Even a little bit of cement is really going to increase the footprint of whatever it is  
**[0:45:41-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:41):**  you're making.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:42):**  Now on the other hand, if you're going to build a rocket mass heater with a little bit  
**[0:45:47-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:47):**  of Portland cement, it will probably- You can be forgiven for that, for the energy  
**[0:45:52-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:52):**  savings.  
**[0:45:53-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:53):**  Well, you're going to reverse carbon footprint so much with it that it's going to more, it's  
**[0:46:01-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:01):**  probably going to displace that carbon footprint in the first week.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:08):**  Yep, there's all those variables.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:12):**  And that's what builds your forums.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:15):**  That's true.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:18):**  That's true.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:19):**  And a lot of people that are watching all, make sure that everybody's dotted the I's  
**[0:46:23-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:23):**  and crossed the T's on all the details of everything.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:26):**  That's right.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:27):**  He's censoring all of you.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:28):**  Oh, no, I'm thinking about if you're going to try and build something, like when people  
**[0:46:34-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:34):**  try to build a cob house in Montana, then you'll have people in the forums that'll say  
**[0:46:41-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:41):**  like, dude, you need something that insulates, you're going to be so cold.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:50):**  Stuff like that.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:51):**  Sure.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:52):**  And it's all, yeah, you've got to take into account everything that they're planning on  
**[0:46:57-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:57):**  doing, how they're planning on overcoming some of the obstacles that would take out  
**[0:47:03-0:47:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:03):**  someone else's project if they hadn't considered it.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:05):**  It goes on and on.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:10):**  What's next?  
**[0:47:11-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:11):**  Okay.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:12):**  So I've always wanted to ask you this because I know like me, you're a big fan of Seth Holzer's  
**[0:47:18-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:18):**  work.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:19):**  And for anybody who hasn't heard of Seth Holzer, you need to get on the YouTube right away.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:23):**  He has a fantastic documentary called the Rebel Gardener.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:28):**  He's a really innovative farmer from Austria and there's a ton you can learn about.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:33):**  He's got some great books out there as well.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:36):**  What are some of the most influential aspects from his teachings and his philosophies about  
**[0:47:40-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:40):**  farming that have affected your work?  
**[0:47:46-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:46):**  The first time I met Seth, I tried to share with him some of my ideas and then he yelled  
**[0:47:54-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:54):**  out catastrophe.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:58):**  And I think that's the only English word he knows, which because the German word is catastrophic,  
**[0:48:06-0:48:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:06):**  because I've heard him say that too.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:09):**  But the funny thing is that I showed him my ideas, he said catastrophe and then later  
**[0:48:18-0:48:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:18):**  when his book comes out in English, there's my ideas which are different from what he  
**[0:48:23-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:23):**  used to do.  
**[0:48:25-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:25):**  So I kind of...  
**[0:48:29-0:48:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:29):**  What are the greatest influences that Seth has had?  
**[0:48:32-0:48:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:32):**  Oh, geez, that guy is amazing because he did it.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:40):**  And it's like so often you get to somebody and they say, nobody can make money in permaculture.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:46):**  And then you point at Seth Holzer, what about that guy?  
**[0:48:49-0:48:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:49):**  He's probably bringing in like four million a year.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:52):**  That doesn't...  
**[0:48:53-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:53):**  What, you think $4 million a year is like no money?  
**[0:48:56-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:56):**  Is that what you just said?  
**[0:48:57-0:48:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:58-0:48:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:58):**  He's in Austria.  
**[0:48:59-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:59):**  Really?  
**[0:49:00-0:49:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:00):**  And the top of the mountains too.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:04):**  That's the best you got is because he's not in the United States, that it's impossible  
**[0:49:07-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:07):**  for anybody in the United States to make money with permaculture.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:10):**  The key is, is that this guy has been doing permaculture for so long and he's been doing  
**[0:49:18-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:18):**  it whole hog.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:20):**  He's got like 70 ponds and he's got food just popping out of the ground everywhere.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:29):**  And he finally got to the point like he's...  
**[0:49:32-0:49:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:32):**  Oh, the other thing is, is he's paid more agricultural fines than any other farmer in  
**[0:49:40-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:40):**  all of Europe.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:42):**  And it's like, so basically the government is like just riding this guy's ass and making  
**[0:49:50-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:50):**  him pay all these fines.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:51):**  But he's like, yeah, not a problem.  
**[0:49:53-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:53):**  I'll pay that.  
**[0:49:54-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:54):**  Because he's making so much coin.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:58):**  And they keep making laws specifically to shut him down.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:50:04):**  So he finally gave up on selling seeds and then he stopped selling food.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:50:10):**  But here's what he does.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:50:12):**  That's just astounding.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:50:14):**  And it's kind of like, oh man, that is like three levels up from what any permaculture  
**[0:50:21-0:50:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:50:21):**  person could even imagine doing.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:50:23):**  Because all these permaculture people are kind of like, and then I'm going to go into  
**[0:50:28-0:50:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:50:28):**  poverty for life with a CSA and I'll have a hundred clients that I'll sell food to.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:50:36):**  And it's like, they kind of got this whole plan that's just doomed to poverty.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:50:41):**  And this guy has moved so many levels beyond anything like a CSA that now people pay 95  
**[0:50:54-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:50:54):**  euros just to walk onto his land and he's got like a hundred people per day shelling  
**[0:51:00-0:51:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:00):**  out 95 euros.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:02):**  That adds up to like over a million dollars a year right there.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:06):**  And the schedule is like, look, it's packed.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:10):**  And it's like, so then the people come onto his land and they get a tour and then you  
**[0:51:17-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:17):**  believe they bring all these empty backpacks and then they leave.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:21):**  I think that they may have stolen some food.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:26):**  And so then the thing is, is that the government is saying, okay, if you try to sell any food,  
**[0:51:31-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:31):**  we're going to regulate the hell out of you and tax you and all this stuff.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:35):**  But he's not selling any food.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:37):**  I mean, he's growing a lot of food and feeding a lot of people, but he's not selling it.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:44):**  These people are just walking on for a tour and then it's like, okay, you guys show yourselves  
**[0:51:51-0:51:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:51):**  out now.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:52):**  Bye.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:53):**  I'm going to go on to the house.  
**[0:51:54-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:54):**  I won't be looking at what you're stealing.  
**[0:51:55-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:55):**  See ya.  
**[0:51:56-0:51:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:56):**  Yeah, that guy is so inspirational.  
**[0:51:57-0:51:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:58-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:58):**  We could do a whole podcast just on what we've kind of gleaned from his videos and from his  
**[0:52:09-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:09):**  talks and from his books and stuff.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:13):**  So whenever somebody says it doesn't work or you can't make money.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:17):**  He's the perfect one to point at.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:21):**  You asked me what's his greatest achievement?  
**[0:52:24-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:24):**  That.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:26):**  Just the fact that we can point at him and say, look at that guy.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:32):**  He did it.  
**[0:52:35-0:52:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:35):**  And if you can't imagine how to get there after there's like five awesome videos and  
**[0:52:43-0:52:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:43):**  like three amazing books, and if you can't figure it out from point A to point B, then  
**[0:52:53-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:53):**  it's not Seth's problem.  
**[0:52:55-0:52:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:55):**  That's your problem.  
**[0:52:56-0:52:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:56):**  Right.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:57):**  Now, you stated on your site that your consulting services are not a good fit for everybody  
**[0:53:03-0:53:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:03):**  because you focus heavily on making a net income in excess of like 200K annually, raising  
**[0:53:09-0:53:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:09):**  animals, producing more than 90% of your own food and including the help of interns and  
**[0:53:14-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:14):**  volunteers.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:15):**  I mean, obviously this is affected by some of the ambitions that this guy has instilled  
**[0:53:19-0:53:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:19):**  in you and me and a lot of other people.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:22):**  Why are those some of your main priorities?  
**[0:53:27-0:53:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:27):**  Whenever anybody wants me to come to their property and give them advice, there's two  
**[0:53:32-0:53:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:32):**  important things.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:33):**  One, you really don't want my advice.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:39):**  It's like, all I'm going to do is make you cry.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:45):**  It's kind of like you need to find somebody who's going to say the things that you want  
**[0:53:52-0:53:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:52):**  to hear.  
**[0:53:53-0:53:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:53):**  I'm not going to say the things you want to hear.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:57):**  And it's like people seem to have a hard time understanding a lot of this stuff.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:04):**  And it's like when Sep goes to a property, the owner will be sitting there saying, but,  
**[0:54:10-0:54:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:10):**  but, but, he waves them off.  
**[0:54:12-0:54:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:12):**  He tells them to shut up.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:15):**  He's like talking through an interpreter, but he just puts his hand like right in their  
**[0:54:20-0:54:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:20):**  face to tell them to shut up.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:23):**  He doesn't want to hear their drivel.  
**[0:54:27-0:54:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:27):**  And so he's awesome.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:28):**  I mean, the thing is, is I've gone on so many different things with Sep and I've seen him  
**[0:54:34-0:54:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:34):**  do it so many times.  
**[0:54:36-0:54:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:36):**  It makes sense.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:37):**  A person is going to say, oh, I want Sep to come by and tell me magic things, but they  
**[0:54:43-0:54:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:43):**  really don't want to listen to Sep.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:46):**  What they want is they want Sep to regurgitate their own ideas.  
**[0:54:51-0:54:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:51):**  And Sep thinks their ideas are stupid.  
**[0:54:54-0:55:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:54):**  No, those ideas you have are horrible.  
**[0:55:03-0:55:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:03):**  And you know, I don't think I'm at a level that Sep's at.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:09):**  And I get it.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:10):**  I list the ideas and then I'm going to have gals and I'm going to put them here and then  
**[0:55:15-0:55:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:15):**  I'm going to, and it's kind of like their ideas are like so kindergarten.  
**[0:55:22-0:55:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:22):**  And it's like, no, this could be so much easier than what you're imagining.  
**[0:55:28-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:28):**  One time I went with Sep and we're looking at this property and this gal had a problem  
**[0:55:33-0:55:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:33):**  with blackberry vines.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:36):**  I don't know.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:37):**  Have you ever been to the Pacific Northwest?  
**[0:55:38-0:55:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:38):**  Oh, that's where I did most of my schooling.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:55:42-0:55:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:42):**  People have paid me a lot of money just to remove those.  
**[0:55:47-0:55:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:47):**  So this woman had like, I think about 15 acres.  
**[0:55:52-0:55:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:52):**  And so what she did was, she just brought in a lot of goats and had them, just wouldn't  
**[0:55:58-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:58):**  feed them until they ate all the blackberries.  
**[0:56:01-0:56:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:01):**  And so she did, she got them to wipe them all out.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:04):**  Sep was livid pissed.  
**[0:56:06-0:56:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:06):**  He's like, so basically you tortured innocent animals instead of like finding a more efficient  
**[0:56:13-0:56:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:13):**  way of doing this.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:15):**  And then of course her whole property is like devoid of growth of anything except for trees.  
**[0:56:21-0:56:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:21):**  And all the trees have been girdled by the goats.  
**[0:56:23-0:56:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:23):**  In the meantime, the goats that are still there are living in kind of like a mud hole.  
**[0:56:31-0:56:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:31):**  It was a horrible thing.  
**[0:56:32-0:56:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:32):**  And Sep just couldn't stop talking about how much he hated this woman and what she's done.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:40):**  And so, all right, so you're looking at the thing where I basically am trying to dissuade  
**[0:56:47-0:56:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:47):**  people from having me be their consultant.  
**[0:56:51-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:51):**  And now there have been a few people that have like listened to all of my podcasts and  
**[0:56:57-0:56:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:57):**  watched all of my videos.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:59):**  And so for those people, I don't mind going and being a consultant because they know what  
**[0:57:02-0:57:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:57:02):**  they're getting into and they know what I'm going to recommend and suggest.  
**[0:57:08-0:57:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:57:08):**  And then I don't mind because it's like we speak the same language now.  
**[0:57:13-0:57:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:57:13):**  They're familiar with all the things I'm going to say.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:57:17):**  But so often it's like I get invited somewhere and I want to say catastrophe.  
**[0:57:24-0:57:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:57:24):**  It's like, oh, praise the way I'm raising my chickens.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:57:28):**  And it's like they've got them in a little coop and run.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:57:31):**  There's greenery in the coop and run, but just outside of the coop and run is a jungle  
**[0:57:37-0:57:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:57:37):**  of stuff that the chickens could like groove on.  
**[0:57:42-0:57:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:57:42):**  And the ground level inside the coop is like four inches taller than outside the coop because  
**[0:57:51-0:57:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:57:51):**  they built it up with that much chicken shit over what, eight years or something?  
**[0:57:59-0:58:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:57:59):**  Chicken diseases are built up in that pad.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:01):**  So these chickens and then the chickens are in constant shade.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:06):**  They don't get any sun.  
**[0:58:09-0:58:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:09):**  So then I start ranting about their chickens and then they're like, get off my property.  
**[0:58:14-0:58:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:14):**  I don't need to hear this.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:17):**  And it's like, I don't need to have somebody give me a bunch.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:20):**  Oh, that's the second thing too.  
**[0:58:22-0:58:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:22):**  Earlier I said one step, there's two things.  
**[0:58:25-0:58:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:25):**  One is people really don't want my advice.  
**[0:58:28-0:58:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:28):**  They think that they do, but really they do not.  
**[0:58:32-0:58:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:32):**  And the second thing is pay me in advance because you're going to end up kicking me  
**[0:58:36-0:58:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:36):**  off of your land.  
**[0:58:39-0:58:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:39):**  So for those people who have listened this far, have heard what you've had to say and  
**[0:58:43-0:58:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:43):**  still think your ideas are good, I'm on board with it.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:46):**  What are some of the methods that you coach people through to reach some of these lofty  
**[0:58:51-0:58:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:51):**  goals that you talk about?  
**[0:58:54-0:59:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:54):**  I would have to say, like, okay, here's an example that's not SEP, it's all me and it  
**[0:59:01-0:59:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:01):**  was done entirely over the phone.  
**[0:59:03-0:59:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:03):**  And so it was a permaculture instructor.  
**[0:59:06-0:59:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:06):**  The guy's taught a bunch of PDCs and he's like, okay, I'm on my way to the client's  
**[0:59:13-0:59:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:13):**  property and they have 200 acres and I've got a whole design I've put together.  
**[0:59:20-0:59:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:20):**  And basically what I'm going to encourage them to do on this property is really awful  
**[0:59:24-0:59:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:24):**  soil, but it's flat.  
**[0:59:25-0:59:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:25):**  It's a big flat place.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:27):**  But the soil is really bad.  
**[0:59:29-0:59:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:29):**  Like weeds struggle to grow there.  
**[0:59:34-0:59:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:34):**  And he says, I want them to grow alfalfa and sell alfalfa for the local people who have  
**[0:59:46-0:59:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:46):**  horses and feed them alfalfa.  
**[0:59:50-0:59:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:50):**  And I got really angry with this guy who's my friend.  
**[0:59:53-0:59:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:53):**  I got angry at my friend.  
**[0:59:56-0:59:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:56):**  Don't be my friend because I get extra angry at you.  
**[0:59:59-1:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:59):**  And so I asked him some more about the property.  
**[1:00:05-1:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:00:05):**  Well there's a house on the property and the guy that is the main guy that lives in the  
**[1:00:13-1:00:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:00:13):**  house who's not the guy that you talk to because apparently he's a yogi or a guru or something  
**[1:00:20-1:00:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:00:20):**  like that.  
**[1:00:21-1:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:00:21):**  He's people all over the world think this guy is super cool.  
**[1:00:25-1:00:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:00:25):**  And it's like a 10 bedroom house and there's only like two people living in the house.  
**[1:00:32-1:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:00:32):**  And so the permaculture instructor guy is going to talk to the other person and show  
**[1:00:38-1:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:00:38):**  the plans and stuff.  
**[1:00:40-1:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:00:40):**  The guru yogi guy is like meditating or something.  
**[1:00:45-1:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:00:45):**  And so the thing I said was, okay, here's what I want you to do is to take an acre,  
**[1:00:52-1:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:00:52):**  load it up with berms and hugelkultur and do a food forest and polycultures and grow  
**[1:00:59-1:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:00:59):**  food, grow lots and lots of food without irrigation.  
**[1:01:04-1:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:04):**  And then next year take another acre and do that again.  
**[1:01:08-1:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:08):**  And each year prep another acre like this.  
**[1:01:13-1:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:13):**  The next thing to do is start renting out the rooms.  
**[1:01:18-1:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:18):**  And so then you'll rent them out cheap in the beginning but there's people that are  
**[1:01:22-1:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:22):**  going to come to this far, far away place in the middle of nowhere where the soil is  
**[1:01:25-1:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:25):**  terrible and they're going to want to bond with this guy.  
**[1:01:30-1:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:30):**  And so then they'll rent the room for a certain period of time.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:34):**  And then rather than trying to sell the food that you're growing, which by the way, enters  
**[1:01:38-1:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:38):**  you into a whole bunch of political nightmare stuff with trying to sell food, instead you  
**[1:01:45-1:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:45):**  just have somebody that's there that cooks food for whoever it is that happens to come  
**[1:01:50-1:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:50):**  by.  
**[1:01:51-1:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:51):**  It's part of the thing for renting this room.  
**[1:01:55-1:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:55):**  And so the thing I suggested was is that you feed the people who come to see the yogi guy  
**[1:02:06-1:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:02:06):**  and that that's your business model.  
**[1:02:09-1:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:02:09):**  And anyway, I think that in time as the years pass, you'll get more and more money per  
**[1:02:18-1:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:02:18):**  night per room and you'll end up with far more than you could ever get selling hay or  
**[1:02:25-1:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:02:25):**  trying to sell this food directly.  
**[1:02:31-1:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:02:31):**  I also think that the food that people would eat there, like they'll come to visit with  
**[1:02:34-1:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:02:34):**  this guy and they might leave feeling better because I believe that there's a lot of powerful  
**[1:02:42-1:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:02:42):**  healing properties in polyculture food that is not irrigated.  
**[1:02:48-1:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:02:48):**  I think that that's the best food in the world for people.  
**[1:02:52-1:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:02:52):**  Why is that?  
**[1:02:55-1:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:02:55):**  Well, consider for a moment the carrot.  
**[1:03:00-1:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:03:00):**  And so currently you go and you buy your organic carrots that were grown in a monocrop field.  
**[1:03:06-1:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:03:06):**  They're organic.  
**[1:03:08-1:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:03:08):**  And then somebody put manure on the field or possibly some minerals and stuff that are  
**[1:03:12-1:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:03:12):**  the things that make carrots bright and look good and sellable.  
**[1:03:18-1:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:03:18):**  And now each carrot plant as it grows, it has exudates.  
**[1:03:26-1:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:03:26):**  And at the same time, the carrot roots go out and then they find things in the soil  
**[1:03:31-1:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:03:31):**  that they bring in.  
**[1:03:34-1:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:03:34):**  Carrots were not designed to grow in a monocrop.  
**[1:03:38-1:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:03:38):**  Carrots were designed to grow in a polyculture.  
**[1:03:40-1:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:03:40):**  And so then out there with a bunch of other plants, there's 50 other plants and there's  
**[1:03:47-1:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:03:47):**  mycelium in an aged soil, then the carrots are getting a lot of the root exudates and  
**[1:03:56-1:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:03:56):**  a lot of the other exudates from all the other plants and that's its nutrition base.  
**[1:04:03-1:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:04:03):**  And a lot of these things are things that we haven't even figured out how to measure  
**[1:04:08-1:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:04:08):**  yet or that they even, we haven't even quantified or qualified them yet.  
**[1:04:16-1:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:04:16):**  Then that carrot that grew up with 50 other plants is getting the nutrition that it needs  
**[1:04:24-1:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:04:24):**  according to nature's design as opposed to a field of monocrop where the only thing  
**[1:04:32-1:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:04:32):**  available to it is carrot exudates from its neighbors, which it doesn't want because  
**[1:04:38-1:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:04:38):**  it's exuding the same thing, but whatever it is that somebody put into the soil because  
**[1:04:44-1:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:04:44):**  they read somewhere that that was good for carrots.  
**[1:04:48-1:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:04:48):**  So if I can understand you right, if I can narrow this down to a sound bite, it sounds  
**[1:04:53-1:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:04:53):**  like you're saying it takes a village to raise a carrot.  
**[1:04:59-1:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:04:59):**  It takes diversity.  
**[1:05:02-1:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:02):**  Right.  
**[1:05:03-1:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:03):**  Now some grains are designed to grow in a monocrop, but even their monocrops aren't  
**[1:05:07-1:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:07):**  very monocroppy.  
**[1:05:08-1:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:08):**  I mean they're still going to have a lot of other species growing in between them and  
**[1:05:12-1:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:12):**  typically they're still going to be growing on an aged soil that has mycelium and that  
**[1:05:17-1:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:17):**  soil is going to have soil structure, whereas the monocrop, especially with organic, I mean  
**[1:05:26-1:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:26):**  with organic systems they till three times more often than with conventional systems.  
**[1:05:33-1:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:33):**  And so then they're going to, every time you till the soil you lose 30% of your organic  
**[1:05:38-1:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:38):**  matter, so you basically are growing these carrots in something that's closer to cement  
**[1:05:44-1:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:44):**  than soil and because it's been tilled so much there hasn't been a chance for very much  
**[1:05:48-1:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:48):**  mycelium to get started in the soil.  
**[1:05:51-1:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:51):**  So it's like this nearly sterile soil.  
**[1:05:56-1:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:56):**  And take a look, a lot of people eat, they're like eating baby spinach, which is like the  
**[1:06:02-1:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:02):**  flavorless variety of spinach and it's like how did that get that way?  
**[1:06:06-1:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:06):**  Well it was grown in a hydroponic system.  
**[1:06:11-1:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:11):**  But the spinach had water and whatever nutrients they put into the system.  
**[1:06:15-1:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:15):**  So sure it's labeled as organic but it's like, you know, it's...  
**[1:06:20-1:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:20):**  It really tells part of the story.  
**[1:06:25-1:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:25):**  The key is it's not a polyculture.  
**[1:06:29-1:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:29):**  And it's not even soil and it's still a monocrop and it's often times a really artificial system.  
**[1:06:40-1:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:40):**  And so then, but you know, people buy that and eat it.  
**[1:06:43-1:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:43):**  It's like it says organic on it and spinach.  
**[1:06:45-1:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:45):**  Hey, Popeye grooved on spinach.  
**[1:06:48-1:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:48):**  Surely it's got to be good for you.  
**[1:06:49-1:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:49):**  No, I'm right there with you.  
**[1:06:51-1:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:51):**  There's a big gap between I guess the ideals that a lot of people believe come along with  
**[1:06:58-1:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:58):**  that label organic and what the actual practice is and how similar or sometimes even worse  
**[1:07:05-1:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:05):**  from conventional agriculture, industrial agriculture that it can be just behind a different  
**[1:07:10-1:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:10):**  label.  
**[1:07:11-1:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:11):**  Well, the good thing about organic is that it's at least a half-assed effort to have  
**[1:07:18-1:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:18):**  less toxins in it.  
**[1:07:20-1:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:20):**  Hey, and I'm all four steps in the right direction.  
**[1:07:24-1:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:24):**  But then the next, you know, when you go 10 levels up from that, then you start talking  
**[1:07:30-1:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:30):**  about permaculture and polyculture, now we're adding the nutrition back into that food because  
**[1:07:37-1:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:37):**  we're emulating nature as opposed to this very artificial way of growing food.  
**[1:07:45-1:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:45):**  That's very well said.  
**[1:07:46-1:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:46):**  I appreciate that.  
**[1:07:47-1:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:47):**  Now since you have your finger on the pulse of this permaculture and natural building  
**[1:07:52-1:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:52):**  world between the experiments that you're doing and everything on the forums, do you  
**[1:07:57-1:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:57):**  have any predictions or innovations or discoveries that are going to start to shape the future  
**[1:08:02-1:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:02):**  of these two practices?  
**[1:08:06-1:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:06):**  Wow.  
**[1:08:07-1:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:07):**  Wow.  
**[1:08:08-1:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:08):**  Predictions about the future.  
**[1:08:10-1:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:10):**  Come on.  
**[1:08:11-1:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:11):**  Tell me what's the next big thing?  
**[1:08:14-1:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:14):**  I mean, I want to fill this space with what my fantasies are as opposed to my Nostradamus  
**[1:08:24-1:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:24):**  stuff.  
**[1:08:25-1:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:25):**  Well, give me both then.  
**[1:08:26-1:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:26):**  Let's hear the optimistic version and then what you think is going to happen.  
**[1:08:30-1:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:30):**  I tell you, my crystal ball has a big crack in it so it's no good.  
**[1:08:36-1:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:36):**  But I believe, in fact, here at my place, we've been here three years and I like to  
**[1:08:43-1:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:43):**  think that by the time we get to 10 years that you can take somebody who has cancer  
**[1:08:51-1:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:51):**  and they're told you have one week left to live, we give up.  
**[1:08:56-1:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:56):**  I like to think that we will bring that person here and then their cancer will just go away.  
**[1:09:05-1:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:05):**  That is ambitious.  
**[1:09:06-1:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:06):**  I like it.  
**[1:09:07-1:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:07):**  Because I really believe I've got a crazy theory.  
**[1:09:12-1:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:12):**  Now you might want to put on your tinfoil hat here.  
**[1:09:16-1:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:16):**  That's good.  
**[1:09:17-1:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:17):**  I know you're good for this stuff.  
**[1:09:18-1:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:18):**  Okay.  
**[1:09:19-1:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:19):**  So here's my crazy theory.  
**[1:09:21-1:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:21):**  I think that cancer comes from carcinogens.  
**[1:09:25-1:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:25):**  I know it's nuts.  
**[1:09:28-1:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:28):**  It's nuts.  
**[1:09:30-1:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:30):**  Most people believe that cancer comes from the cancer fairy.  
**[1:09:33-1:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:33):**  This little invisible being that floats around and goes, ding, you get cancer.  
**[1:09:41-1:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:41):**  That's where it comes from.  
**[1:09:42-1:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:42):**  You find out somebody's got cancer and they're saying, oh, that's too bad.  
**[1:09:49-1:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:49):**  That's terrible.  
**[1:09:50-1:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:50):**  The fairy got you.  
**[1:09:52-1:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:52):**  That sucks.  
**[1:09:55-1:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:55):**  As opposed to the question that I would ask is, what have you been poisoning yourself  
**[1:10:00-1:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:00):**  with?  
**[1:10:02-1:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:02):**  Which I think is fairly accurate.  
**[1:10:04-1:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:04):**  I believe, to expand on that a little bit, I believe that cancer comes from carcinogens  
**[1:10:12-1:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:12):**  that we know of and that we don't yet know about.  
**[1:10:20-1:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:20):**  So while everybody's kind of like, I've been drinking out of this plastic all my life and  
**[1:10:25-1:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:25):**  now I find out it's got BPA in it.  
**[1:10:28-1:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:28):**  So I threw that out the window where I throw all my garbage and I got this new plastic  
**[1:10:35-1:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:35):**  thing and it says right on it, doesn't have the BPA on it.  
**[1:10:38-1:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:38):**  And it's been like, I can't help but think that it's got something worse than BPA in  
**[1:10:44-1:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:44):**  it.  
**[1:10:45-1:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:45):**  And as soon as the government catches onto it, they'll just switch it to something else  
**[1:10:50-1:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:50):**  that the government hasn't investigated yet.  
**[1:10:54-1:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:54):**  And so I kind of got this crazy idea that our world is loaded with toxins and carcinogens  
**[1:11:04-1:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:11:04):**  and natural building combined with permaculture techniques.  
**[1:11:10-1:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:11:10):**  I think that this is going to be the end solution.  
**[1:11:18-1:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:11:18):**  And I guess I should qualify that as I fantasize.  
**[1:11:25-1:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:11:25):**  I'm not really sure where we're going to end up but I do believe that we're going to change  
**[1:11:33-1:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:11:33):**  the way that people eat food and we're going to change the way that we approach toxicity.  
**[1:11:39-1:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:11:39):**  And I love the idea that it's kind of like somebody's seriously ill.  
**[1:11:43-1:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:11:43):**  Maybe it's not even cancer, maybe it's something else.  
**[1:11:46-1:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:11:46):**  Unexplained they can't figure it out.  
**[1:11:48-1:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:11:48):**  I mean it was 12 years ago that I was bonkers about permaculture and I realized I had to  
**[1:11:56-1:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:11:56):**  quit my day job and go down the path that I'm on now.  
**[1:12:02-1:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:12:02):**  And during that period of time, a woman was telling me about how her husband has some  
**[1:12:12-1:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:12:12):**  intestinal disease that the doctors can't figure out and he's only got six weeks left  
**[1:12:18-1:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:12:18):**  to live.  
**[1:12:20-1:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:12:20):**  And for whatever reason, he's never been to Europe so they decided to go to Europe.  
**[1:12:25-1:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:12:25):**  He goes to Europe and his disease mysteriously goes away.  
**[1:12:30-1:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:12:30):**  For two weeks it's just gone.  
**[1:12:34-1:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:12:34):**  He lives large, he eats whatever he wants, everything is wonderful.  
**[1:12:39-1:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:12:39):**  Then he comes back to the United States and he has the disease again.  
**[1:12:45-1:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:12:45):**  So what is it?  
**[1:12:49-1:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:12:49):**  What's making that dude sick that isn't over in Europe?  
**[1:12:54-1:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:12:54):**  I think that this is going to be what a lot of this is about and I love the idea of building  
**[1:13:00-1:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:13:00):**  something with natural building that's very, very, very clean.  
**[1:13:07-1:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:13:07):**  It's very, very, very natural.  
**[1:13:10-1:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:13:10):**  Several orders of magnitude beyond what most people consider natural building and that  
**[1:13:15-1:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:13:15):**  the only food is stuff that we've grown in polycultures with permaculture systems and  
**[1:13:21-1:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:13:21):**  then if somebody's riddled with some disease they can come here and I'm going to fantasize  
**[1:13:28-1:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:13:28):**  that they're diseased.  
**[1:13:31-1:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:13:31):**  I like it.  
**[1:13:36-1:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:13:36):**  Those are some heavy ambitions but it's a unique approach and it's going to take a whole  
**[1:13:41-1:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:13:41):**  lot of more experimentation and innovation which will keep your Wheaton Labs running  
**[1:13:48-1:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:13:48):**  for a long time.  
**[1:13:51-1:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:13:51):**  Well they do something like this over at Sep's place right now.  
**[1:13:57-1:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:13:57):**  People are going there that don't understand permaculture or natural building or any of  
**[1:14:02-1:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:14:02):**  that stuff.  
**[1:14:03-1:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:14:03):**  They're going there and they say that he has, what do you call it, the water of life?  
**[1:14:14-1:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:14:14):**  The spring of youth.  
**[1:14:17-1:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:14:17):**  The spring of life or the spring of youth?  
**[1:14:23-1:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:14:23):**  Yeah something like that.  
**[1:14:25-1:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:14:25):**  So there's people from all over the world that are going there just to drink the water  
**[1:14:31-1:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:14:31):**  because they believe that it heals everything and it's magical.  
**[1:14:39-1:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:14:39):**  And I mean Sep's a businessman.  
**[1:14:46-1:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:14:46):**  He's not going to correct them.  
**[1:14:48-1:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:14:48):**  I don't think he advertises that at all.  
**[1:14:50-1:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:14:50):**  That's just entirely, but here in Montana a woman had been there and drank the water  
**[1:15:00-1:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:15:00):**  and she was convinced that it was like this magical water and she hired Sep to come here  
**[1:15:11-1:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:15:11):**  to Montana and put these water systems into her property.  
**[1:15:19-1:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:15:19):**  And so she thought, oh the fountain of youth, that's what it is.  
**[1:15:25-1:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:15:25):**  And so I remember that when Sep was done and he had left and there was all this big equipment,  
**[1:15:34-1:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:15:34):**  still all these earth movers and stuff like that still shaping the land.  
**[1:15:39-1:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:15:39):**  I remember I found the woman sitting on a pile of mud and I asked her, so what do you  
**[1:15:45-1:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:15:45):**  think?  
**[1:15:46-1:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:15:46):**  And she said, I wanted the fountain of youth, I paid for the fountain of youth, what I got  
**[1:15:53-1:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:15:53):**  was instant farm and I don't want to be a farmer.  
**[1:15:57-1:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:15:57):**  What did you think was going to happen hiring Sep?  
**[1:16:02-1:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:16:02):**  Well yeah that's what I explained to her and I said, so let me see if I can kind of come  
**[1:16:06-1:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:16:06):**  up with an analogy here.  
**[1:16:08-1:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:16:08):**  So you've looked at Sep's paintings and all of his paintings are nudes and then people  
**[1:16:19-1:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:16:19):**  think that there's a different aesthetic to all these nudes and you even looked at some  
**[1:16:23-1:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:16:23):**  of the nudes and you saw a painting of space.  
**[1:16:29-1:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:16:29):**  And so then you hired him to paint a painting for you and you were very emphatic that what  
**[1:16:37-1:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:16:37):**  you wanted was something with planets and quasars and nebulas and stuff like that.  
**[1:16:45-1:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:16:45):**  So he painted a nude that had all of that in it and you're pissed.  
**[1:16:51-1:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:16:51):**  It's like this is what he does, this is where it comes from.  
**[1:16:57-1:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:16:57):**  You get the fountain of youth, you get the water of life, you get all of that with instant  
**[1:17:03-1:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:17:03):**  farm.  
**[1:17:04-1:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:17:04):**  Yeah, it sounds like she didn't lose, she just didn't get what she was originally thinking.  
**[1:17:11-1:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:17:11):**  Right exactly and you know what, that's exactly why I don't want people to hire me as a consultant.  
**[1:17:19-1:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:17:19):**  Just think about it, she's all dreamy about how Sep's going to come and she doesn't know  
**[1:17:25-1:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:17:25):**  what he's going to do but it's going to be awesome by her standards of what is awesome.  
**[1:17:33-1:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:17:33):**  But what Sep did is he came and he made something that was awesome by Sep's standards of awesome.  
**[1:17:41-1:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:17:41):**  I get to a property and they want me to give advice and it's like yeah but we're going  
**[1:17:45-1:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:17:45):**  to torture our chickens forever and what we want you to do is stop talking about how to  
**[1:17:55-1:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:17:55):**  raise chickens a different way.  
**[1:17:57-1:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:17:57):**  What we want you to do and what we're paying you to do is to tell us how awesome we are  
**[1:18:02-1:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:02):**  with raising chickens.  
**[1:18:06-1:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:06):**  And of course what I'm thinking is you're torturing these poor chickens, they're suffering  
**[1:18:10-1:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:10):**  under your care.  
**[1:18:12-1:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:12):**  It's that whole thing of like we must be awesome at raising chickens because most of them haven't  
**[1:18:17-1:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:17):**  died.  
**[1:18:18-1:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:18):**  You know and it's like that's a terrible metric, that's an awful metric.  
**[1:18:28-1:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:28):**  Yeah I hear you man.  
**[1:18:30-1:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:30):**  Well hey before I let you go here can you make sure that everybody knows the best ways  
**[1:18:36-1:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:36):**  to get in contact either with you or interact with the site or I know you've got a DVD set  
**[1:18:44-1:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:44):**  for the Rocket Mass Heaters.  
**[1:18:46-1:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:46):**  So we have eight DVDs about Rocket Mass Heaters, the four old ones which were just video of  
**[1:18:52-1:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:52):**  a workshop and then the four new ones that are like a dozen different events all packed  
**[1:18:59-1:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:59):**  into four DVDs.  
**[1:19:02-1:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:02):**  Far more information rich now.  
**[1:19:04-1:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:04):**  And then we've got a three DVD set that's called World Domination Gardening which is  
**[1:19:08-1:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:08):**  about Earthworks stuff.  
**[1:19:11-1:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:11):**  And then we did the Permaculture Playing Cards which it's like everybody buys them by the  
**[1:19:17-1:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:17):**  dozen at Christmas time to put into people's stockings.  
**[1:19:20-1:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:20):**  The cards were designed so that way if your bonkers about permaculture but your friends  
**[1:19:26-1:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:26):**  and family think you're nuts then what you do is you give this to them for Christmas  
**[1:19:32-1:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:32):**  and we tried to design it so that if they actually open it and look at the cards then  
**[1:19:38-1:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:38):**  they'll think that you're less nuts.  
**[1:19:41-1:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:41):**  Interesting.  
**[1:19:42-1:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:42):**  This was our mission.  
**[1:19:46-1:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:46):**  I've had some people confirm that it worked.  
**[1:19:50-1:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:50):**  That is intriguing.  
**[1:19:51-1:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:51):**  Yeah we've sold a lot of cards.  
**[1:19:53-1:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:53):**  I can imagine.  
**[1:19:54-1:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:54):**  There's a lot of permies that are like I need my family to think that I'm not nuts anymore.  
**[1:19:59-1:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:59):**  Well there you go.  
**[1:20:00-1:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:00):**  Those are the Permaculture Playing Cards to bridge the gap between you and your more conservative  
**[1:20:05-1:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:05):**  family members.  
**[1:20:06-1:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:06):**  There's all of that.  
**[1:20:08-1:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:08):**  We've got the podcast, the YouTube videos, articles and then of course the forums have  
**[1:20:15-1:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:15):**  1.2 million people per month and 22 million page views so a lot of people.  
**[1:20:28-1:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:28):**  It sounds like I asked the wrong question.  
**[1:20:30-1:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:30):**  I should have asked how can people avoid your stuff?  
**[1:20:33-1:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:33):**  That seems like a harder job.  
**[1:20:35-1:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:35):**  It does seem like if you search for a lot of permaculture stuff.  
**[1:20:40-1:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:40):**  Yeah so there you have it like anywhere you look on the web at this point you're going  
**[1:20:45-1:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:45):**  to through some web end up at one of Paul Wheaton's either DVDs, websites or other materials.  
**[1:20:53-1:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:53):**  So thank you so much for giving me your time today Paul.  
**[1:20:56-1:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:56):**  It was such a pleasure talking to you.  
**[1:20:57-1:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:57):**  I'm going to have to do this again sometime.  
**[1:20:59-1:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:59):**  Oh okay that sounds like fun.  
**[1:21:02-1:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:21:02):**  Thank you.  
**[1:21:03-1:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:21:03):**  Take care now.

**[1:21:25-1:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:21:25):**  Now one last thing before we go.  
**[1:21:27-1:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:21:27):**  I would really love it if you would help me make these episodes into a dialogue.  
**[1:21:30-1:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:21:30):**  The purpose of these is not to be a one-way lecture series but rather a conversation starter.  
**[1:21:36-1:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:21:36):**  Something that provokes inspiration and inspires you to get involved.  
**[1:21:39-1:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:21:39):**  I would love to hear what you think in the comments section on the website.  
**[1:21:43-1:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:21:43):**  And as much as it would be great to have subscriptions and likes and stuff on social media I would  
**[1:21:48-1:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:21:48):**  much prefer if you were to share these face to face and use it as an excuse to rekindle  
**[1:21:54-1:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:21:54):**  some personal contact.  
**[1:21:55-1:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:21:55):**  Maybe with someone you haven't talked to in a while but to get off of the screens and  
**[1:22:00-1:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:22:00):**  turn these into live conversation starters.  
**[1:22:04-1:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:22:04):**  Anyway thanks so much for tuning in and I'll see you on the next episode.  
**[1:22:34-1:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:22:34):**  Bye.

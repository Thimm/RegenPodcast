**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:01:26):**  Have you ever felt completely bogged down by the weight of current events and news?  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:01:30):**  Things like climate change, government corruption, war and violence seem to be the norm and hard  
**[0:01:34-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:01:34):**  to get away from.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:01:36):**  I know these things affect me deeply and that's why I'm always looking for positive news  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:01:40):**  and media about solutions and inspiring change.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:01:44):**  That's why I'm proud to say that I've partnered with one of my favorite sources for just those  
**[0:01:47-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:01:47):**  things.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:01:48):**  New Society Publishers are book publishers that focus on putting out great books and  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:01:53):**  positive solutions for individuals and organizations seeking to change their lives so that they  
**[0:01:58-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:01:58):**  can go on to change the world for the better.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:02:00):**  And what's more, their company mandate goes far beyond the single bottom line of profit.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:02:05):**  They actually care deeply, not only about what they publish, but also about how they  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:02:09):**  do business.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:02:10):**  They believe in the authors they take on and the works they bring to the marketplace.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:02:15):**  From sustainable living to progressive parenting, New Society Publishers have the books you  
**[0:02:19-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:02:19):**  need to help build a better world.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:02:21):**  In fact, the author that I'm interviewing today, Zach Lokes, and his book The Permaculture  
**[0:02:26-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:02:26):**  Market Garden are published by them.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:02:28):**  And if you stay tuned at the end of this interview, I'll tell you how you can be eligible to win  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:02:32):**  your own copy of The Permaculture Market Garden.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:02:35):**  So stick around for that after the interview.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:02:38):**  My guest today is Zach Lokes, the owner of the 50-acre Cula Permaculture Farm in the  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:02:43):**  Ottawa Valley of Ontario, Canada.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:02:46):**  There they run a local CSA, grow over 100 varieties of vegetables, herbs, fruits, nuts  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:02:52):**  and trees, and even offer yoga retreats and children's summer camps.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:02:57):**  Zach is also the author of the book The Permaculture Market Garden, which is an in-depth guide  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:03:01):**  to the techniques that he's developed and refined over many years of running this multifaceted  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:03:06):**  and profitable farm.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:03:08):**  In this interview, Zach talks about how growing up on a permaculture homestead in northern  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:03:13):**  New Mexico helped to give reference as he developed and grew Cula Farm.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:03:17):**  He also talks in detail about his perma-bed system, profit resilience, and finding a balance  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:03:23):**  between the diversity needed in a permaculture farm and the focus and efficiency needed to  
**[0:03:28-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:03:28):**  make a profit.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:03:30):**  This interview is chock full of practical advice and information that you can take and  
**[0:03:33-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:03:33):**  apply to your own gardening project no matter what size.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:03:37):**  So grab a notebook and I'll turn things over to Zach.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:03:40):**  Hey Zach, welcome to the podcast!  
**[0:03:42-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:03:42):**  It's great to have you here.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:03:43):**  Hey, thanks for having me.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:03:44):**  Now, I know there are a ton of questions that I'd love to ask you today, so how about we  
**[0:03:49-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:03:49):**  just jump right in?  
**[0:03:50-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:03:50):**  That sounds good.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:03:51):**  Alright, so let's start off by having you explain a little bit about your background  
**[0:03:55-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:03:55):**  and how you got into market gardening.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:03:57):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:04:00):**  So I grew up on a permaculture homestead in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and my dad was a permaculture  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:04:06):**  designer and my brother and I would go around and work with him.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:04:10):**  And that eventually led to me getting into design and landscape myself and I did that  
**[0:04:15-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:04:15):**  for a while.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:04:17):**  And I worked on a couple farms growing up and kind of helped out and things like that.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:04:22):**  But I didn't really get really into agriculture until I moved up to Canada and met my wife  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:04:28):**  who's sixth generation on a family farm in the Ottawa Valley.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:04:33):**  And that's pretty much the moment when I really started to get out on the land and grow food  
**[0:04:37-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:04:37):**  in a big way.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:04:38):**  Now tell me a little bit more about how you grew up.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:04:40):**  It was probably pretty uncommon back then to live in sort of a permaculture homestead  
**[0:04:47-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:04:47):**  situation.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:04:48):**  How did that affect the way that you saw the relationship with the land and agricultural  
**[0:04:52-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:04:52):**  production?  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:04:53):**  Yeah, I mean, I guess like most kids, you know, whatever you're used to, you're used  
**[0:04:58-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:04:58):**  to.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:04:59):**  So I didn't think much of it until I left school age and started getting out into the  
**[0:05:05-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:05:05):**  world a little more.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:05:06):**  But yeah, I mean, remembering back, we had a lot going on.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:05:13):**  As kids, we'd play in the fruit trees and climb around the fruit trees and we'd tag  
**[0:05:17-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:05:17):**  along with my dad to job sites and we'd spend a lot of time running around nurseries, picking  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:05:22):**  out plants and learning the names of different plants and loading them into our Mazda van.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:05:26):**  We had a big Mazda van.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:05:27):**  We ripped out all the back seats and we'd just fill them up with trees and take them  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:05:31):**  out to sites and help plant and build swales.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:05:35):**  So I think, you know, it gave me a pretty good insight later on into the relationship  
**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:05:41):**  between plants and the importance between plants and community and all the benefits,  
**[0:05:47-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:05:47):**  the goods and services that they can provide in terms of fruit and shade and shelter and  
**[0:05:53-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:05:53):**  curbing erosion.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:05:55):**  And especially in New Mexico, a big thing is, you know, xeriscaping, planting so that  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:06:00):**  you are able to have drought tolerant landscapes because it's so dry and there's so little  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:06:04):**  water or it's periodically, you know, there's floods and so you want to prevent erosion.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:06:09):**  So I think just growing up in the desert and growing up on that homestead gave me a greater  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:06:14):**  appreciation for the services that plants can provide and the importance they have for  
**[0:06:18-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:06:18):**  our community.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:06:19):**  Yeah, no doubt.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:06:20):**  Now, you've been living in Canada for a while.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:06:23):**  How long have you been farming using your market gardening system?  
**[0:06:27-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:06:27):**  Yeah, so for market gardening, we've been doing that for 10 years and that was, yeah,  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:06:36):**  that was an interesting transition because I've been, you know, mostly gardening and  
**[0:06:41-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:06:41):**  then working doing ecological resource assessment and research in the boreal forest and got  
**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:06:48):**  into market gardening.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:06:50):**  We've been doing that for 10 years, but then really after about three or four years started  
**[0:06:58-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:06:58):**  to get quite large and then now reintegrating permaculture into that pattern.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:07:07):**  So really going the full spectrum, I think from, from, you know, very intensive permaculture  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:07:13):**  homestead early on and then getting into market gardening and just really trying to be production  
**[0:07:19-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:07:19):**  oriented and then sort of losing track of the kind of bigger picture and how to really  
**[0:07:25-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:07:25):**  improve our soil and how to have a regenerative production that's building soil every year  
**[0:07:32-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:07:32):**  and thinking long term, which is more of a permaculture mindset.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:07:35):**  So that brought us back towards my roots and I think where we are now, we really married  
**[0:07:41-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:07:41):**  the efficiency and practicality of the farmer, especially the family farm with many generations  
**[0:07:48-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:07:48):**  where you, you know, you really are stick to the land and you, you know, you're invested  
**[0:07:52-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:07:52):**  in the land and the idea of a permaculture where you create systems that are well designed  
**[0:08:00-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:08:00):**  and will evolve with time.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:08:02):**  So practical, you know, permaculture really.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:08:05):**  Yeah, that's very important.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:08:07):**  Now I wanted to start out by talking about a major theme in your book, the permaculture  
**[0:08:11-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:08:11):**  market garden and that's profit resilience.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:08:14):**  I know that one of the biggest hurdles for any farmer, but especially permaculture list  
**[0:08:19-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:08:19):**  is getting to a point where their business is actually profitable.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:08:22):**  Can you explain the steps that someone could take to achieve profit resilience?  
**[0:08:27-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:08:27):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:08:29):**  I think this is one of the big problems that we're facing right now is market gardens are  
**[0:08:38-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:08:38):**  really oriented towards annual production and annual profitability and not just in the  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:08:45):**  sense that they're growing annuals, but that they're really looking at how they can get  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:08:49):**  return every year.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:08:51):**  And that's really important.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:08:53):**  But with profit resilience, you get return every year and you're profitable, but you  
**[0:08:59-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:08:59):**  do this by also investing into the future.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:09:02):**  So it's investing into planting a tree and knowing that there's annual return on that  
**[0:09:08-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:09:08):**  investment and yes, down the road you have timber, you have fruit, you have all these  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:09:15):**  other benefits that fruit trees and other trees can provide, but what are the short  
**[0:09:20-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:09:20):**  term benefits that can be had as well?  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:09:22):**  So that's a big part of this idea around profit resilience is getting that annual return from  
**[0:09:27-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:09:27):**  a perennial investment.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:09:30):**  And one example I give is by planting every 12th bed in your market garden into trees  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:09:37):**  and these could start out being very low cost trees.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:09:40):**  You could buy oak and maple, you can dig them out of the bush, it could cost you as little  
**[0:09:48-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:09:48):**  as $50 to plant a row of trees in a market garden.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:09:52):**  And within only a few years, you're getting really good snow retention over the winter,  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:09:57):**  which is going to help provide cover for soil life.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:10:02):**  And soil life are critical to the production of vegetables.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:10:06):**  So in order to have really healthy vegetables, we want to have good colonies of mycorrhizal  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:10:12):**  fungi and nitrogen and bacteria and all the other little creatures that are in the soil  
**[0:10:17-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:10:17):**  that are opening up pore space and creating good networks of nutrient exchange with the  
**[0:10:24-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:10:24):**  plants.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:10:25):**  And these things are really enhanced by having permanence in the garden and having trees  
**[0:10:30-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:10:30):**  in the garden help create that environment.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:10:34):**  The sheltering from the snow and other benefits include breaking the wind in the summertime.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:10:41):**  We love growing summer spinach and summer salad in a market garden and yet in order  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:10:47):**  to do that really well in areas that get quite hot and in the valley here we get over 30  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:10:51):**  degrees Celsius in the summer and most areas that are market gardening will hit similar  
**[0:10:55-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:10:55):**  temperatures.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:10:56):**  We spend a lot of money irrigating or creating shade structures in order to grow those profitable  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:11:02):**  super high value per square foot salad greens and spinach.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:11:07):**  And we can start to mimic ecosystem services, the shade and the reduced wind desiccation  
**[0:11:15-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:11:15):**  by intercropping with trees.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:11:17):**  So these are annual returns we get.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:11:18):**  These returns we get in the short term from planting intercropping trees into a market  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:11:23):**  garden and oh yes they have all these great benefits that are also accruing in the long  
**[0:11:28-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:11:28):**  term.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:11:29):**  So that profit resilience is that annual return on perennial investment.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:11:34):**  Yeah and I'm sure that you know there's a lot of other options aside from oak as well  
**[0:11:39-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:11:39):**  and down the line a lot of those can create a profit or return as well through their fruits  
**[0:11:45-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:11:45):**  or nuts or whatever it might be.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:11:48):**  Yeah for sure.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:11:49):**  So you know oak or maple is a nice one to start if you want to just play around and  
**[0:11:54-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:11:54):**  not have to invest a lot.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:11:57):**  And then you know there's a lot of beneficial tree species that you can plant that have  
**[0:12:02-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:12:02):**  really good profits and you know we recommend starting to intercrop with any species that  
**[0:12:08-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:12:08):**  you determine that are environmentally fit to your area, to your farm.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:12:15):**  And we do this through what we call an index guild and you can learn more about that on  
**[0:12:20-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:12:20):**  my Instagram Kula Permaculture Farm.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:12:23):**  I've got a series on that with many videos up right now but essentially an index guild  
**[0:12:28-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:12:28):**  is where around the homestead or the farmstead you start to do a planting of an edible landscape  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:12:35):**  with you know two or three individuals of any one species that you want to start to  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:12:40):**  trial that you think have potential for the farm.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:12:44):**  And after a few years you see they're surviving winters you know that they're hardy to your  
**[0:12:49-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:12:49):**  area you can start to collect seeds and suckers and scion from those species and move them  
**[0:12:57-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:12:57):**  out into a nursery bed in the field.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:13:00):**  And here they continue to grow some more now you're starting to get more fruit and berries  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:13:04):**  off these you can start to you know determine what the market desirability of these species  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:13:10):**  you know selling the local farmers market or trialing on yourself and then you really  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:13:14):**  now have a sense of the ones you really want to produce in a big way and now you have maybe  
**[0:13:19-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:13:19):**  a 300 foot bed in your field and you have lots of resource for suckers and scions and  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:13:27):**  seeds to collect from and you can start to propagate those out into your field.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:13:32):**  So using this three stage transition method you can quite effectively and affordably turn  
**[0:13:38-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:13:38):**  a small medium or large acreage of farm or market garden over to an agroecology something  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:13:45):**  that's mimicking an ecosystem but it's an agroecosystem maybe a woodland market garden  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:13:51):**  say and it all started with those initial planting that's just really you know a nice  
**[0:13:56-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:13:56):**  way of beautifying the farmstead or the homestead and then moving out into the field and by  
**[0:14:02-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:14:02):**  the time you start producing in a big way you know you know these are species that will  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:14:05):**  work well together you have have generated a lot of the production material the genetic  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:14:11):**  propagation material yourself so it's not too expensive and you also have really good  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:14:16):**  examples right near the farm in the homestead that are the most mature so they offer a zone  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:14:22):**  one window into what's happening out in that zone three or four production and by zone  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:14:27):**  one two three four you know within permaculture just for those who who maybe aren't as familiar  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:14:32):**  zone one is what's near to the farm or near to the home that you might frequent every  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:14:37):**  day multiple times a day and then zone two three it's it's less often and by the time  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:14:42):**  you get to zone four you're visiting it maybe once or twice a month right so you really  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:14:46):**  get a really good window into timing of field operations for fruit trees and nut trees and  
**[0:14:51-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:14:51):**  berries and such.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:14:52):**  That's fantastic and I really want to get back a little bit more to guilds in a minute  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:14:56):**  but I know that this is also a really big topic but could you give a little overview  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:15:01):**  of holistic budgeting since I know that it goes hand in hand with your concepts of profit  
**[0:15:06-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:15:06):**  resilience.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:15:07):**  Yeah for sure.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:15:09):**  Yeah so when you're holistically budgeting a really big part of that is to keep in mind  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:15:15):**  to pay the farmer a wage.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:15:17):**  I think that this is this is another aspect of profit resilience that really should be  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:15:23):**  you know held near and dear to the the farmer especially a startup farm they're really trying  
**[0:15:28-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:15:28):**  to get into it is to right away from the get-go plan for a wage for yourself and that way  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:15:35):**  when you're budgeting and you're you're thinking about what your expenses are for the season  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:15:39):**  you are an expense you know because it's too easy to you know buy more row cover or think  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:15:45):**  you need another tool or you know when push comes to shove in the middle of summer you  
**[0:15:50-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:15:50):**  know make a split-second decision but if you have budgeted in your budget for you to have  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:15:56):**  a wage at the beginning and you've set aside that money then you're more likely to come  
**[0:16:00-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:16:00):**  out at the end of the year and feel confident to go into the next year because you're actually  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:16:06):**  making a living at farming instead of just scraping by and there's amazing how many things  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:16:12):**  you know swallow up money because we don't budget property oh it's all the little things  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:16:16):**  you know the the shear bolts we just keep buying them and buying them until one until  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:16:20):**  we you know consider well why are they breaking so often you know or just take buying something  
**[0:16:26-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:16:26):**  just because you think well this will be you know better but is it really better or is  
**[0:16:32-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:16:32):**  you know you know feeling like you've made a good living at the end of the year the best  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:16:35):**  thing for the farm after all so farms have to be profitable or they turn into parking  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:16:40):**  lots and holistic holistic budgeting this is from holistic resource management and I  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:16:46):**  really recommend that anybody who's interested in that you know dive into the wealth of information  
**[0:16:51-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:16:51):**  out there including there's entire courses you can take on holistic resource management  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:16:56):**  from now and savory Institute and that's a really valuable resource for any farmer and  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:17:01):**  any homesteader that's trying to transition into production that is commercial no doubt  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:17:07):**  yeah it's an essential ingredient that so often gets overlooked while people really  
**[0:17:13-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:17:13):**  dive deep into the ecology or the farming methods and all these things but to be effective  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:17:19):**  as a business you really need to get these skills down yeah no for sure tell me as well  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:17:25):**  if this has been your experience but with most of the permies and the farmers that I've  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:17:29):**  worked with and consulted with they often have trouble striking a balance between over  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:17:34):**  focusing on a few cash crops and growing them intensively often as a monoculture or being  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:17:40):**  over idealistic with their land and going too far with diversity while struggling to  
**[0:17:45-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:17:45):**  make a profit how have you found a balance between these two things yeah I mean this  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:17:51):**  is a key point I really really glad you bring that up because this is the number one thing  
**[0:17:56-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:17:56):**  sometimes it's on my mind is that the the permaculture list is you know a jack of all  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:18:03):**  trades and master of none and they want to do everything you know the number of times  
**[0:18:09-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:18:09):**  someone has told me you know because we get lots of interns on the farm and I talked to  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:18:12):**  lots of people all around Canada and the US and they're they're saying oh well you know  
**[0:18:18-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:18:18):**  I want to get this piece of land and I want to have chickens and goats and bees and a  
**[0:18:21-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:18:21):**  garden and orchard and a reforestation and alternative building and like every cool thing  
**[0:18:27-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:18:27):**  that's happening on the planet they want to do it and you're going to be exhausted and  
**[0:18:34-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:18:34):**  you're going to be stretched thin because all of those things take a different skill  
**[0:18:37-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:18:37):**  set and they all require different tools and they all require different labor and in the  
**[0:18:43-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:18:43):**  end you know I would rather see farms focus homesteads focus on a guild of enterprises  
**[0:18:53-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:18:53):**  within their property so just like we have a guild of plant species that can get planted  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:18:59):**  out in a garden or into an agroecology in the field maybe there's a dominant nut tree  
**[0:19:04-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:19:04):**  and maybe an understory fruit tree and a vine like a grape and a ground cover and they're  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:19:10):**  all helping fill together a niche we can take that concept of the guild and apply it to  
**[0:19:15-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:19:15):**  business and say what's the guild enterprise of your farm and I always aim for three and  
**[0:19:22-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:19:22):**  I use this idea of the rule of three as a kind of way of helping simplify decision making  
**[0:19:29-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:19:29):**  so if you ask me a question and the answer is a number I'm going to give you back the  
**[0:19:32-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:19:32):**  answer three and it seems silly but it occurs to me that you know one you're all alone and  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:19:39):**  when you have two you know you're just two talking together having a conversation but  
**[0:19:44-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:19:44):**  the moment you put three it's the first time you have complex interactions and so as a  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:19:50):**  way of just kind of simplifying thing I just take three and say all right let's start with  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:19:54):**  that so if you're going to go and start a farm then what are your three enterprises  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:20:00):**  that you're going to start to think about and your land can help teach you about what  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:20:05):**  might work well on it and your community can help teach you about what they're going to  
**[0:20:10-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:20:10):**  want to support what they're in what's in demand and you and your skill set and your  
**[0:20:16-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:20:16):**  goals and who you are is going to also help dictate what is going to fit into that enterprise  
**[0:20:22-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:20:22):**  that guild enterprise and so then you build around that and three acts is both the minimum  
**[0:20:29-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:20:29):**  and the maximum for diversity in a way so we can diversify within the enterprises to  
**[0:20:36-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:20:36):**  an extent but we're not just going to keep throwing endless things into it and this this  
**[0:20:41-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:20:41):**  helps kind of keep us in check so you know for us for instance we we produce and do vegetables  
**[0:20:49-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:20:49):**  and fruit and we distribute through a CSA that's an enterprise and we do heirloom seed  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:20:55):**  garlic and we distribute throughout Canada we have an heirloom seed garlic business and  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:21:00):**  we do mail order and that's an enterprise and then we do research and design and consulting  
**[0:21:06-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:21:06):**  we do education and that's an enterprise and so these enterprises now are really the foundation  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:21:12):**  of our business and we're really going to think if we add new things or we're going  
**[0:21:16-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:21:16):**  to see how they fit tidily into one of these enterprises and then we can work on having  
**[0:21:22-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:21:22):**  the enterprises actually act like a guild and have symbiosis between them so how do  
**[0:21:28-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:21:28):**  they share resources you know how do they create an input out of a waste how do they  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:21:38):**  inform each other's decision making on the farm and how do they balance labor on the  
**[0:21:43-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:21:43):**  farm so they work as a guild which is good but then back to your original question it's  
**[0:21:50-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:21:50):**  so important to see how that simplicity actually results in success when this kind of endless  
**[0:21:59-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:21:59):**  ideal of doing everything usually doesn't result in as much success and ironically I  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:22:06):**  would say that farms will end up being more biodiverse and the landscape as a whole will  
**[0:22:11-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:22:11):**  be more biodiverse and profitably diverse if we have all our farms focused on these  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:22:20):**  kind of guild enterprises and then within the regional landscape and the local landscape  
**[0:22:26-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:22:26):**  we see a farm community guild and so you know you don't have to do everything because you  
**[0:22:34-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:22:34):**  can trade your honey for cheese and you can exchange root cellar vegetables for eggs you  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:22:43):**  know these things can happen on that greater landscape scale and if we look at an ecosystem  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:22:48):**  this is more parallel to a real ecosystem when you look at the patchwork of an ecosystem  
**[0:22:53-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:22:53):**  across a region it's diverse but there's also great swaths of things happening you know  
**[0:23:01-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:23:01):**  every small you know third acre one acre ten acre doesn't have everything that we're talking  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:23:09):**  about so i think a little bit of the permaculture idea that the cycle has to be completely closed  
**[0:23:15-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:23:15):**  within the farm well that's putting borders on ecology and agro ecology which is really  
**[0:23:23-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:23:23):**  contradictory to what agro ecology is it's borderless it moves and fluctuates and it's  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:23:29):**  about that greater connectivity so i would say that that simplicity is going to lead  
**[0:23:35-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:23:35):**  to success because the farmer will be focused and not stretch too thin they'll be able to  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:23:39):**  focus their investments focus their skill building and focus their marketing and then  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:23:45):**  across the greater landscape they're going to get all what they need you know in terms  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:23:49):**  of healthy products for themselves and the overall landscape is going to be very very  
**[0:23:54-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:23:54):**  rich in diversity and profitable productivity. I really love how you laid that out and frankly  
**[0:24:00-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:24:00):**  that was one of my biggest takeaways from reading your book I'm in a personal transition  
**[0:24:05-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:24:05):**  right now from earlier in my business when I had taken on a ton of different things which  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:24:11):**  while I am sure that I could have done any one of them competently when I took on too  
**[0:24:16-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:24:16):**  much I ended up spread thin and the quality of certain aspects started to fail and in  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:24:22):**  learning exactly what you've been talking about I've switched to focusing on a couple  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:24:27):**  of things that I know that I can do to the level of quality that I want to be known for  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:24:32):**  and establish as a reputation for my business but there's still enough diversity within  
**[0:24:37-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:24:37):**  that that I don't over focus on any one thing and cut off options to expand so I think that's  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:24:44):**  really not only valuable in farming but in other aspects of business and like you said  
**[0:24:49-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:24:49):**  community interaction.  
**[0:24:52-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:24:52):**  Yeah that's right and in that you build in that resiliency too because the farm itself  
**[0:25:00-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:25:00):**  has the potential to move in many different directions by thinking like a permaculturist  
**[0:25:07-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:25:07):**  and building layers into your farm the next generation the next steward doesn't actually  
**[0:25:14-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:25:14):**  have to do exactly what you're doing because you've laid out the land and you've built  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:25:21):**  up the potential for them to take it in many directions.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:25:25):**  You know we currently aren't doing honey on the farm but by God could someone come in  
**[0:25:30-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:25:30):**  here and do it real well real quick.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:25:32):**  You know.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:25:33):**  Yeah exactly.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:25:34):**  It leaves those openings for other people to fill if they found that that was their  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:25:38):**  specialty that was their focus without having you know a whole bunch of little arms and  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:25:43):**  a lot of different enterprises all of which are being done sort of at a at a compromise  
**[0:25:48-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:25:48):**  level.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:25:49):**  Now I wanted to get back to what you were talking about perennial systems because this  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:25:53):**  is something that we always come back to in permaculture and frankly in any type of land  
**[0:25:58-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:25:58):**  regeneration type of enterprise.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:26:01):**  You mentioned earlier mostly about different types of tree species and the benefits that  
**[0:26:06-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:26:06):**  they can have in your market garden.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:26:07):**  Can you talk about maybe some other layers either berries or bushes or even substrate  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:26:13):**  levels talking about mycelium that could be perennial systems that have other benefits  
**[0:26:19-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:26:19):**  for your annuals.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:26:22):**  Yeah for sure.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:26:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:26:24):**  And you know it's important to remember that you know the most important layer in a way  
**[0:26:32-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:26:32):**  is that soil layer and that soil life layer.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:26:35):**  So really if we you know if we start and we look at a say a woodland ecosystem and we  
**[0:26:40-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:26:40):**  say well we want to mimic a woodland ecosystem we want to create a woodland agro ecosystem.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:26:47):**  So out in the field we want to start to intercrop dominant tree species you know chestnuts and  
**[0:26:52-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:26:52):**  walnuts and pecans and then we want to go down a little bit more and maybe have mulberries  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:26:59):**  and then down a little more and start to have you know full size fruit trees and then dwarf  
**[0:27:04-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:27:04):**  fruit trees pears Asian pears plums and then we can have shrub layers.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:27:10):**  You know we can have hazelnuts and and elderberries and below that we can have a bush layer we  
**[0:27:16-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:27:16):**  can have currents and canes like raspberries and black raspberries and below that we can  
**[0:27:24-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:27:24):**  have an herb layer various flowering layers for bouquets and we can have ground covers  
**[0:27:31-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:27:31):**  like thyme and strawberries and mints and we can have fungi that are growing you know  
**[0:27:38-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:27:38):**  off from freshly cut wood or in the actual ground layer itself on wood chips and below  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:27:46):**  that we have the soil layer and in the soil layer there's a root layer and a tuber layer  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:27:51):**  and rhizome layer and there's all those things that can be harvested as well but really the  
**[0:27:56-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:27:56):**  whole time the thing that we're cultivating that is the most important is the soil life  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:28:01):**  layer and that layer that has micro-hyzal fungi and you know the majority of food plants  
**[0:28:07-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:28:07):**  the majority of plants on the planet have evolved over all of their evolution in association  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:28:14):**  you know with micro-hyzal fungi and so without that they're really walking around without  
**[0:28:19-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:28:19):**  toes you know it's not easy and you know there's bacteria in there that are fixing nitrogen  
**[0:28:25-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:28:25):**  right from the atmosphere in association with legumes and there's nematodes and earthworms  
**[0:28:32-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:28:32):**  and arthropods and there's protozoa there's so much going on and essentially what these  
**[0:28:38-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:28:38):**  organisms are doing as a whole is they're taking up nutrients and they're storing it  
**[0:28:45-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:28:45):**  in their bodies and holding it in the soil and then they're you know being eaten and  
**[0:28:51-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:28:51):**  releasing nitrogen and they're dying and decomposing and releasing nutrients and they're tunneling  
**[0:28:57-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:28:57):**  and opening up the soil and leaving biopore space and creating better soil aggregation  
**[0:29:04-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:29:04):**  so that the mineral part of the soil the part that's actually different textures of mineral  
**[0:29:10-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:29:10):**  material which has been eroded from the rocks the raw rocks of our planet and that's the  
**[0:29:16-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:29:16):**  sands and the silts and the clay those textures that's all being bound together by the organic  
**[0:29:23-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:29:23):**  matter and the soil life manure I call it micromanure and all of that's binding that  
**[0:29:31-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:29:31):**  together and creating this aggregate that has mineral and organic and living and that  
**[0:29:38-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:29:38):**  in itself is a super valuable asset to the market garden because if we consider for a  
**[0:29:43-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:29:43):**  second that officially speaking soil is 45% mineral 25% air 25% water and about 5% organic  
**[0:29:54-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:29:54):**  matter then if we don't have 50% of our soil as pore space to hold air and water then we're  
**[0:30:03-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:30:03):**  not even talking about soil and in order to have that pore space we need to be able to  
**[0:30:10-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:30:10):**  manage that it's not compacted and we need to be able to have the functioning soil ecosystem  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:30:16):**  and the tree roots and plant roots that are opening it up and preventing that pore space  
**[0:30:20-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:30:20):**  from being lost and I always like to give a really solid example of why that's so important  
**[0:30:27-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:30:27):**  so if we consider that plants take up their nutrients in solution that the nutrients are  
**[0:30:33-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:30:33):**  actually brought in soil solution a water solution to the roots and if we don't have  
**[0:30:38-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:30:38):**  the pore space for that water to be there then that nutrient is not actually going to  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:30:43):**  be able to be taken up by the plants and we consider that the soil life itself you know  
**[0:30:48-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:30:48):**  also helps bring it up like micro-hyso fungi literally are taking up nutrients and exchanging  
**[0:30:55-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:30:55):**  it with our plants for root exudates for sweet sugars because the plant photosynthesizes  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:31:02):**  so the plants growing and says hey you know I'm gonna bring in this sugar from the or  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:31:07):**  make sugar out of the sun and I'm gonna send it down to you and they're like great that's  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:31:11):**  awesome let me let me help you get water and let me help you access nutrients and you know  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:31:16):**  even communication because now we're seeing that there's research that's showing that  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:31:21):**  the micro-hyso fungi actually help plants communicate and that a dying tree in a forest  
**[0:31:27-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:31:27):**  will actually send out its carbon to its progeny in the surrounding understory so there's a  
**[0:31:33-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:31:33):**  lot of value there but just just the pore space alone and understanding how essential  
**[0:31:39-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:31:39):**  that is shows us that a compacted soil that's denuded of soil life why you can pour as much  
**[0:31:45-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:31:45):**  fertilizer on as you want it's not gonna matter a bit it's gonna a wash away and B there's  
**[0:31:54-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:31:54):**  nowhere in the soil for it to be taken up into solution and brought to the plant and  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:32:00):**  there's no soil life to help it get there and you want to have this complex aggregate  
**[0:32:05-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:32:05):**  with good cation exchange capacity so the soil itself has a high capacity to hold on  
**[0:32:12-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:32:12):**  to nutrient cations and anions and then release them back to that solution and that's what  
**[0:32:19-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:32:19):**  we want we want a soil that's able to sequester store cycle release nutrients to our plants  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:32:27):**  and that's one of the key things of why we should really appreciate of all those ecosystem  
**[0:32:31-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:32:31):**  layers and those agro ecosystem layers that are integrated into guild production that  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:32:38):**  we should really consider the real high value of that soil layer and the life that's in  
**[0:32:43-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:32:43):**  it and the structure that is so important as well.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:32:47):**  Absolutely now I know you take real care to facilitate these interactions in these complex  
**[0:32:52-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:32:52):**  relationships in your market garden and specifically the relationship between perennials and annuals  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:32:59):**  that help to aid in the soil layer that you just talked about you also mentioned that  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:33:04):**  you employ a system called perma beds can you tell me about how that works and how someone  
**[0:33:09-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:33:09):**  could mimic this system to make their own garden more resilient and productive.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:33:15):**  Yeah for sure yeah so the perma bed system that we use is one that has a whole bunch  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:33:23):**  of benefits for us and the first benefit just based on what we're talking about is helping  
**[0:33:29-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:33:29):**  conserve soil so the perma beds are essentially permanent raised beds or permanent agro ecological  
**[0:33:37-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:33:37):**  beds and what we're doing is scooping path material and applying it to the bed top and  
**[0:33:44-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:33:44):**  we do this on our scale by having a bed forming equipment with large double discs on either  
**[0:33:50-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:33:50):**  side that go behind our tractor tires and lift up the material and put it on top and  
**[0:33:55-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:33:55):**  you can do that with smaller equipment you can do that with a shovel you can do that  
**[0:33:59-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:33:59):**  by building the bed up and then and then putting chip mulch between the key idea here is that  
**[0:34:06-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:34:06):**  the beds are reformed and not destroyed and so you never erase what's happening on the  
**[0:34:13-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:34:13):**  landscape you're always building on it every year so there's two really important parts  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:34:19):**  to that one is that the core of these beds is never being destroyed and so the soil life  
**[0:34:24-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:34:24):**  is conserved in the core of the bed because we apply path material to the top of the bed  
**[0:34:30-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:34:30):**  when we do a shallow harrowing in order to prepare a seed bed we are not disturbing the  
**[0:34:36-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:34:36):**  core of the bed we're just disturbing the recently applied material to the top so that  
**[0:34:41-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:34:41):**  helps the colonies of fungi and bacteria and all those beneficials maintain their populations  
**[0:34:47-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:34:47):**  and recolonize back out into the bed top to help our recently seeded vegetables so that's  
**[0:34:57-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:34:57):**  really key you know if we think about what we do in agriculture a lot of times is we  
**[0:35:03-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:35:03):**  plow the whole field and then we disc the whole field and then we till the whole field  
**[0:35:09-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:35:09):**  and a lot of the beds that are being made in market gardens are actually just area between  
**[0:35:15-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:35:15):**  the tires that's being fluffed up with a tiller and area that's the path that's being compressed  
**[0:35:21-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:35:21):**  by the tires so it's really not actually a bed it's more just a fluffed area with compaction  
**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:35:28):**  on the sides so we want to get away from that and the other thing is that since they plow  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:35:32):**  and disc every year and I understand this because I've done it what happens is you don't  
**[0:35:38-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:35:38):**  actually have your bed in the same place every year because you're plowing and discing it  
**[0:35:42-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:35:42):**  so you lose that sense of place in space so the first main thing is that you get that  
**[0:35:49-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:35:49):**  soil conservation in the middle and then the next really important thing is that because  
**[0:35:53-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:35:53):**  they're permanent in the landscape and you reform them that you really do make place  
**[0:35:58-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:35:58):**  out of space and so every time you give a bed a permanent place in the landscape and  
**[0:36:04-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:36:04):**  you repeat that across the whole landscape with that repetition comes the opportunity  
**[0:36:10-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:36:10):**  to pattern so just like if you're knitting you can do a knitting stitch and then a purl  
**[0:36:16-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:36:16):**  and then a knit and then a purl and then a knit and then the purl and so we can do that  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:36:21):**  across the landscape we can choose to alternate the maturity of our vegetables in order to  
**[0:36:27-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:36:27):**  gain all sorts of amazing opportunities for relay cropping and cover cropping and crop  
**[0:36:34-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:36:34):**  cover cropping where you leave a crop to mature into cover crop by alternating the maturity  
**[0:36:39-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:36:39):**  of the annuals but also we can create more complex patterns like having every twelfth  
**[0:36:45-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:36:45):**  bed be put into a perennial species or having every twelfth bed put into a dominant emergent  
**[0:36:52-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:36:52):**  perennial species like nut trees and fruit trees and then have the next twelfth bed put  
**[0:36:58-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:36:58):**  into a regenerative species of perennial like berries or any sort of berry like raspberries  
**[0:37:06-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:37:06):**  or elderberries things that you may want to occasionally access with a tractor and mow  
**[0:37:11-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:37:11):**  them down or drive over it then and apply compost things like that so we can create  
**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:37:17):**  all these complex patterns by having that permanence so the permabeds it's a system  
**[0:37:22-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:37:22):**  of land management that allows us to move towards an agroecology that allows the land  
**[0:37:30-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:37:30):**  to evolve to build on every year so instead of erasing it every year we're actually building  
**[0:37:36-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:37:36):**  on it every year and helping the soil life proliferate in these soil cores and helping  
**[0:37:42-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:37:42):**  the land transition to a more diverse agroecosystem.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:37:48):**  Absolutely those things are essential and I'm glad there are more voices coming out  
**[0:37:51-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:37:51):**  all the time advocating for exactly what you just talked about.  
**[0:37:55-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:37:55):**  Now here's one question that pretty much everybody wants to know the answer to at some point  
**[0:38:00-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:38:00):**  and there are a whole varying range of answers from depending on who you ask and that is  
**[0:38:07-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:38:07):**  how much food can an average person realistically produce on a given size of land let's say  
**[0:38:12-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:38:12):**  a quarter acre or half acre just to relate to most people who have yards obviously that  
**[0:38:19-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:38:19):**  is going to change as you get into larger acreages but can you give an example from  
**[0:38:23-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:38:23):**  your experience?  
**[0:38:25-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:38:25):**  I mean you can produce a ridiculous amount of food if you think about the photosynthetic  
**[0:38:31-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:38:31):**  strata that you can integrate I mean if we have just one bed on our farm I think in terms  
**[0:38:40-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:38:40):**  of beds right so if we have one bed on our farm and we have them at 300 feet and we can  
**[0:38:46-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:38:46):**  place out across that bed a pear tree at you know every say 20 feet and each one of those  
**[0:38:56-0:39:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:38:56):**  pear trees has the potential to yield 300 pounds of fruit and then in the understory  
**[0:39:03-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:39:03):**  of that we can produce all sorts of things that will love the shade and proliferate in  
**[0:39:10-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:39:10):**  the shade such as mint and other shade loving species in the bed adjacent to it like summer  
**[0:39:17-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:39:17):**  spinach and you know in between those pear trees we have sheltered sugar maples that  
**[0:39:24-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:39:24):**  are growing in the shade and are eventually going to emerge and produce syrup and you  
**[0:39:30-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:39:30):**  know once the syrup season is kicking in 20 some years down the road and you're also taking  
**[0:39:36-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:39:36):**  a you're thinning them out then you have nice maple logs to grow shiitake and they want  
**[0:39:42-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:39:42):**  to grow in that shady area so you know you set them up right there in that shaded area  
**[0:39:47-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:39:47):**  and you you know put over you know a couple more beds maybe you set up a shiitake production  
**[0:39:53-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:39:53):**  and your paths are growing in time and you know before any of this was established maybe  
**[0:39:59-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:39:59):**  these beds were all in raspberries and the raspberries you know helped to deter the deer  
**[0:40:04-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:40:04):**  and allowed these things to establish and you had annuals like squash growing next to  
**[0:40:08-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:40:08):**  it so let's just say these are three beds that we have and that these three beds eventually  
**[0:40:14-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:40:14):**  turn into a section of about 12 of these beds because now we proliferated all of the seeds  
**[0:40:21-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:40:21):**  and suckers and scions from the initial nursery bed across an entire permaplot which for me  
**[0:40:27-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:40:27):**  is 12 beds and so now we have a third of an acre that we've you know essentially quite  
**[0:40:32-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:40:32):**  affordably propagated from this one bed into this diverse ecosystem that I just described  
**[0:40:40-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:40:40):**  and what is the yield of that third acre I can't even begin to imagine what that total  
**[0:40:45-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:40:45):**  yield would be. Especially as it reaches different levels of maturation right? That's right because  
**[0:40:51-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:40:51):**  it's just always evolving so you know we start with our annual field and we can talk about  
**[0:40:56-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:40:56):**  you know the yield per square foot of vegetables and you know you can get a you can get a bag  
**[0:41:02-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:41:02):**  of lettuce you know every half every two or three bags every square foot and you know  
**[0:41:09-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:41:09):**  but then you can you know turn that into another crop and crop it two or three four times in  
**[0:41:15-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:41:15):**  a season depending on the maturity of the vegetables and the more intensive you are  
**[0:41:19-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:41:19):**  the more comes out of it but as soon as you start to go vertical I mean it's just it's  
**[0:41:27-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:41:27):**  absolutely we don't have a good way of calculating it yet because we've never really seen these  
**[0:41:33-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:41:33):**  mature systems. You know the closest examples are the systems that we had in North America  
**[0:41:40-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:41:40):**  before Europeans came over and those were with less domesticated species so when we  
**[0:41:47-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:41:47):**  start to mimic those original agroecologies with the domesticated species that we now  
**[0:41:52-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:41:52):**  have today and in the organized manner that something like permabeds and other land management  
**[0:41:58-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:41:58):**  offer we are talking about yields that are just astronomical.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:42:03):**  Absolutely I mean we're not even talking yet about adding animal layers or talking about  
**[0:42:08-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:42:08):**  you know like you said maybe if you're coppicing trees later on and growing mycelium or mushrooms  
**[0:42:13-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:42:13):**  from that as well. That's right. It's a constantly evolving system and that's one thing that  
**[0:42:18-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:42:18):**  I really like and people point out when I ask questions like this is that the answer  
**[0:42:23-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:42:23):**  could vary significantly by year also by decade. You may start out mostly just producing annuals  
**[0:42:30-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:42:30):**  while your trees and shrubs mature but as your system starts to reach those later years  
**[0:42:35-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:42:35):**  and mature later on you add all these other layers from which you can start drawing resources  
**[0:42:41-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:42:41):**  from. Yeah exactly and you know we're not even talking  
**[0:42:46-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:42:46):**  yet about the sheer savings that you have when you start to have things that produce  
**[0:42:50-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:42:50):**  on their own. Exactly. So a great example of something that people can do early on by  
**[0:42:57-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:42:57):**  adopting a permabed system is I have a patch now of kale that self seeds itself and it's  
**[0:43:04-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:43:04):**  been you know three or four years that it self seeded itself and it's never weedy. It's  
**[0:43:11-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:43:11):**  full of kale. The kale matures so early that the flea beetles which you know anybody in  
**[0:43:16-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:43:16):**  the northeast will know just go crazy for brassicas that we get perfect kale and yet  
**[0:43:23-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:43:23):**  I didn't even have to prep the bed. I didn't have to buy the seed. I didn't have to seed  
**[0:43:28-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:43:28):**  them in trays. I didn't have to have people transplant them into the field and I have  
**[0:43:33-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:43:33):**  the kale way earlier because the bed is permanent and I said I assigned it that duty and you  
**[0:43:39-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:43:39):**  can do that with any bed. Any bed can serve any purpose and then it has all these other  
**[0:43:43-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:43:43):**  benefits on top of that such as the massive amount of flowers that were on it early on  
**[0:43:49-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:43:49):**  which had tons of beneficials and pollinators and when you intercrop with fruit trees then  
**[0:43:56-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:43:56):**  they're holding those bees over for the fruit trees and for other things that require pollination.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:44:02):**  So we have this building this accruing of goods and services in this type of model.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:44:08):**  There's so many things and you can always take advantage of opportunities because in  
**[0:44:12-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:44:12):**  a permanent bed system when you see something happening and you say my God look at what's  
**[0:44:19-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:44:19):**  going on in that bed. You know what I'm going to take that bed out of my general gilled  
**[0:44:25-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:44:25):**  crop rotation and I'm going to let it do what it's doing. You can find all sorts of amazing  
**[0:44:31-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:44:31):**  things. We have an example of this where we have a bed that we mulch down for one crop  
**[0:44:37-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:44:37):**  and then we saw that all the heritage sugar maples had germinated off our hillside. They'd  
**[0:44:41-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:44:41):**  blown off the hillside into this bed and it was acting like a perfect nursery and we just  
**[0:44:47-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:44:47):**  simply took it out of the rotation and turned it into a nursery bed for these heritage sugar  
**[0:44:51-0:44:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:44:51):**  maples and my goodness if we don't have six thousand sugar maples that are taller than  
**[0:44:56-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:44:56):**  me in it right now and now we're pulling those out and it didn't cost me anything. When you  
**[0:45:03-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:45:03):**  let your land mature it gives you so many things and if you're dynamic a system enough  
**[0:45:10-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:45:10):**  you can take advantage of those. You can sell those sugar maples, you can use them as trees  
**[0:45:16-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:45:16):**  to intercrop into the farm, they become windbreaks. We're coppicing with them and we're going  
**[0:45:22-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:45:22):**  to have hardwood tomato stakes. It cost me nothing. This is one of these beauties of  
**[0:45:30-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:45:30):**  the perma-bed system back to above and beyond just the value of the acre or the bed but  
**[0:45:36-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:45:36):**  that permanence itself just lets you take advantage of the opportunities that are going  
**[0:45:41-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:45:41):**  to increasingly exist when you commit to an evolution of the overall agro-ecosystem.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:45:47):**  Yeah that's a great example of that resilience that everyone's shooting for. Now after studying  
**[0:45:54-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:45:54):**  and tweaking and working with market gardens for this long what advice would you give to  
**[0:45:58-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:45:58):**  someone looking to get started right now? What would be their first steps?  
**[0:46:05-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:46:05):**  So one thing is, I like this idea of the blue ocean strategy where the ocean is full of  
**[0:46:13-0:46:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:46:13):**  fishes and they're all feeding in there and if you bring the exact same thing into that  
**[0:46:19-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:46:19):**  ocean, the same thing that everybody else around you is bringing to that ocean, same  
**[0:46:23-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:46:23):**  products to that farmer's market say, it's going to become a red ocean because you're  
**[0:46:28-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:46:28):**  going to start to have a lot more competition. But if you bring a new product into that ocean,  
**[0:46:34-0:46:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:46:34):**  not only are you not competing with those other products for those fishes but you're  
**[0:46:40-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:46:40):**  attracting new fishes into the ocean as well. So I would say for anybody getting into market  
**[0:46:45-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:46:45):**  gardening, look around you at what your neighbors are doing and what the other farmers in your  
**[0:46:50-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:46:50):**  farmer's market or in your local food shed are doing and ask yourself how you can build  
**[0:46:56-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:46:56):**  on their successes and bring something new to the market to create that farm guild community  
**[0:47:03-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:47:03):**  where all the farms are profitable in their enterprise that they do and complementary  
**[0:47:09-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:47:09):**  to each other. So you can both trade with them which is an amazing thing as well as  
**[0:47:14-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:47:14):**  prevent competition with them and rather try to enhance that whole overall community.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:47:20):**  That's fantastic advice. Now what have been some of your biggest learning experiences  
**[0:47:25-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:47:25):**  over your years of farming? What are some things that have caused you to reconsider  
**[0:47:30-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:47:30):**  what you were doing and take a new approach? Yeah, well some of it, a lot of it comes down  
**[0:47:35-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:47:35):**  to just how we came to the perma bed system idea and a lot of the overall discussion around  
**[0:47:43-0:47:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:47:43):**  soil health is just standing out every spring and looking at a plowed field that had to  
**[0:47:49-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:47:49):**  be turned into organized space and just being like, God, I don't want to start from scratch  
**[0:47:56-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:47:56):**  every year, I want to build on it and looking at bare beds of soil everywhere and just seeing  
**[0:48:02-0:48:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:48:02):**  how unnatural it was and knowing that there was something more to it and yet really understanding  
**[0:48:09-0:48:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:48:09):**  and valuing that we need to be efficient and practical because we're a market garden. We  
**[0:48:14-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:48:14):**  can't just have this chaotic abundance out there either. So those were all some things  
**[0:48:20-0:48:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:48:20):**  that were big takeaways. A really important thing is to build on your mistakes and to  
**[0:48:26-0:48:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:48:26):**  understand that a mistake is something learned and so you never feel like you can't make  
**[0:48:32-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:48:32):**  mistakes and in fact I know that there's so many innovative companies out there that encourage  
**[0:48:37-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:48:37):**  mistakes now with their employees because that's how you create innovation and I would  
**[0:48:44-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:48:44):**  be very honest to say that a lot of innovation that we have on the farm is from making mistakes  
**[0:48:49-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:48:49):**  and being forced into tight spaces and by really wanting to do something better after  
**[0:48:54-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:48:54):**  having done it bad. That's something to really value when you're getting started is to learn  
**[0:49:02-0:49:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:49:02):**  from that. One of the great ways of doing that is to keep a journal and I have something  
**[0:49:07-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:49:07):**  I call a whole hemisphere journal and what I do is I start at the beginning of the season  
**[0:49:13-0:49:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:49:13):**  and I take notes through it simply based on the date. It's really like a traditional journal  
**[0:49:19-0:49:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:49:19):**  and what you do is you have a left hand page and a right hand page and you take all your  
**[0:49:24-0:49:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:49:24):**  notes, your thoughts, your observations, everything that just occurs on that left hand page and  
**[0:49:31-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:49:31):**  you always leave that right hand page blank. So then at the end of the year you have a  
**[0:49:36-0:49:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:49:36):**  really good recording of all that little bit of knowledge that came in. The flowering of  
**[0:49:41-0:49:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:49:41):**  plants, the mistakes with the turn up, the possibility of a new crop you saw at a market  
**[0:49:47-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:49:47):**  and then at the end of the year you can go back through, you can digest everything you  
**[0:49:52-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:49:52):**  wrote, all your little data points and then you can turn it over and turn it into direct  
**[0:49:57-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:49:57):**  actions on that right hand page. You can directly improve, directly utilize that feedback in  
**[0:50:04-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:50:04):**  order to evolve for the next year.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:50:07):**  Fantastic. Now before I let you go here, I know that at Kula Farm where you are, you  
**[0:50:13-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:50:13):**  do a lot of events and workshops for the community as well. How can people learn more about your  
**[0:50:17-0:50:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:50:17):**  events and get in touch?  
**[0:50:20-0:50:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:50:20):**  Yeah, for sure. Well, so probably the best ways to find out about that are through our  
**[0:50:27-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:50:27):**  website www.kulafarm.ca and there's a calendar on there that tells about all the events we  
**[0:50:34-0:50:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:50:34):**  have on the farm, workshops that we run on the farm. I do workshops on gardening, root  
**[0:50:41-0:50:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:50:41):**  cellar design, off-grid living and my wife's doing workshops on nutrition and cooking fresh  
**[0:50:48-0:50:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:50:48):**  simple meals. That's all online there and you can also read more about our book, The  
**[0:50:53-0:50:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:50:53):**  Permaculture Market Garden and just learn more about what we're about. Then on that  
**[0:50:58-0:51:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:50:58):**  calendar as well, it just shows anywhere else that I'm going to be speaking in the coming  
**[0:51:03-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:51:03):**  year. So, I'll be in Oregon in August at the Mother Earth News Fair and then I'll be into  
**[0:51:11-0:51:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:51:11):**  Pennsylvania and Topeka and I'll be at the Acorn Conference out in the East Coast of  
**[0:51:18-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:51:18):**  Canada and at the Guelph Conference in Ontario. So, any of these things you can see on our  
**[0:51:24-0:51:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:51:24):**  website and we keep it updated so you can get an opportunity to come to the farm for  
**[0:51:29-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:51:29):**  something or to catch up with us somewhere else at an event or workshop or conference.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:51:35):**  Then if you want to keep up with us on a daily basis, our Instagram account, Kula Permaculture  
**[0:51:43-0:51:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:51:43):**  Farm, I'm always updating that with pictures and know-how and little videos. I play games  
**[0:51:50-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:51:50):**  with mystery plants and stuff and get people to think about what some of the different  
**[0:51:55-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:51:55):**  plants possibilities out there are. So, those are all great ways of following up on some  
**[0:52:00-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:52:00):**  of these things if folks are wishing to get more involved.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:52:04):**  Wonderful. Well, I'll put links to all of those on the show notes for this episode.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:52:09):**  And Zach, thank you so much for a very informative chat. Like I said, I really enjoyed your book  
**[0:52:14-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:52:14):**  and I'll put a link to, is it through New Society that people can pick that up for themselves  
**[0:52:20-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:52:20):**  as well.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:52:21):**  Yeah, for sure.

**[0:53:36-0:53:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:53:36):**  So before we wrap up this show for the week, I've got some exciting news about the upcoming  
**[0:53:40-0:53:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:53:40):**  months. And I'm joined here now with my good friend and founder of Atitlan Organics, Shad  
**[0:53:45-0:53:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:53:45):**  Goodsy.  
**[0:53:46-0:53:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:53:46):**  Hey buddy, what's new?  
**[0:53:47-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:53:47):**  Oh man, so much is happening. First off though, I just want to say thanks for having me, man.  
**[0:53:52-0:53:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:53:52):**  I really love your podcast and I actually had a great time doing that interview back  
**[0:53:56-0:54:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:53:56):**  in one of the earlier episodes. Anyway, probably what's most exciting is our new collaboration  
**[0:54:02-0:54:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:54:02):**  between Atitlan Organics and Abundant Edge. As you know, we've been offering permaculture  
**[0:54:07-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:54:07):**  design courses for over six years now, and they really have become a staple here in Lake  
**[0:54:11-0:54:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:54:11):**  Atitlan. In particular though, the intro to permaculture course is just an amazing way  
**[0:54:17-0:54:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:54:17):**  for travelers, gardeners, architects, basically anyone to fully immerse themselves in this  
**[0:54:23-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:54:23):**  new paradigm of permaculture design. Like honestly, you can't take this course and still  
**[0:54:29-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:54:29):**  see the world the same way afterward, man. It's life changing. But like I said, what  
**[0:54:34-0:54:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:54:34):**  I'm most excited about is that now, thanks to our collaboration, we're going to be able  
**[0:54:39-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:54:39):**  to offer your natural building course immediately after every one of our intro to permaculture  
**[0:54:45-0:54:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:54:45):**  courses. Literally, this two week offering is like possibly the most complete package  
**[0:54:51-0:54:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:54:51):**  that I know of available anywhere. Basically with these two courses alone, I think that  
**[0:54:56-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:54:56):**  someone should have everything they need to start their own regenerative project or just  
**[0:55:01-0:55:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:55:01):**  their own regenerative lifestyle. That's what I'm excited about, man. But yeah, what about  
**[0:55:06-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:55:06):**  you? What's going on? Man, well, you know already that me and the abundant edge team  
**[0:55:11-0:55:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:55:11):**  are gearing up for a big season as well. I mean, starting in November, we'll be breaking  
**[0:55:15-0:55:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:55:15):**  ground on a regenerative farming demonstration site, which is of course right down the hill  
**[0:55:20-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:55:20):**  from your farm. We'll be building animal pens, a classroom, outdoor kitchens and lounge areas  
**[0:55:26-0:55:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:55:26):**  connected to houses, and it's all going to be made out of natural materials. I mean,  
**[0:55:30-0:55:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:55:30):**  the site is going to serve as a demonstration farm for perennial and regenerative farming  
**[0:55:35-0:55:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:55:35):**  methods for years and years to come. And we'll even be offering courses and internship opportunities  
**[0:55:40-0:55:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:55:40):**  to people who want to learn for themselves about how to build with natural materials  
**[0:55:44-0:55:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:55:44):**  and set up their own farms. Heck yeah, that sounds amazing, man. And honestly, this is  
**[0:55:50-0:55:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:55:50):**  just about the best place in the world to learn all these things too. I mean, this little  
**[0:55:54-0:55:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:55:54):**  town is Sununah in the gorgeous tropical mountains of Guatemala, like right here on the shores  
**[0:55:59-0:56:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:55:59):**  of Lake Atitlan. It's one of the most beautiful places in the world. And on top of that, you  
**[0:56:03-0:56:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:56:03):**  have this traditional indigenous Mayan culture that's still rich and alive. And probably  
**[0:56:08-0:56:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:56:08):**  my favorite part is that we have this world international community of alternative people  
**[0:56:15-0:56:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:56:15):**  that are open to new ideas and really putting things into practice. I mean, within walking  
**[0:56:19-0:56:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:56:19):**  distance of the bamboo guest house, you've got loads of things going on. We got the projects  
**[0:56:24-0:56:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:56:24):**  that we've already talked about, but you also have yoga retreat centers. You have Charlie  
**[0:56:28-0:56:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:56:28):**  Rendell's natural bamboo building school. You have Love Probiotics. You have Fungi Academy.  
**[0:56:34-0:56:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:56:34):**  And honestly, loads more alternative blow your mind type stuff. I honestly just feel  
**[0:56:39-0:56:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:56:39):**  like this is where it's all happening. Yeah, man, it really does. And I want to get as  
**[0:56:44-0:56:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:56:44):**  many people as possible in on these projects, but we've got to make sure that they've got  
**[0:56:47-0:56:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:56:47):**  the skills first. So what do you say? Let's offer a big discount to those who sign up  
**[0:56:52-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:56:52):**  for both courses. I mean, all food and lodging and the amazing bamboo guest house is already  
**[0:56:57-0:57:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:56:57):**  included in the tuition, so this will be like the best deal that we've ever offered. That's  
**[0:57:01-0:57:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:57:01):**  a great idea. Because I mean, people can still take just one course if that's what they're  
**[0:57:05-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:57:05):**  into or if they can't make the full two weeks, but this will actually make the two courses  
**[0:57:10-0:57:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:57:10):**  more accessible to even a wider audience of people. That way more people can get the knowledge  
**[0:57:15-0:57:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:57:15):**  that they need to get started doing what they want to do. So hey, to all of you listening  
**[0:57:20-0:57:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:57:20):**  out there, we really want passionate and driven people like you to come and be a part of the  
**[0:57:25-0:57:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-zach-loeks/#t=0:57:25):**  community and the ecosystem that we're building out here. So if you're ready to take the next

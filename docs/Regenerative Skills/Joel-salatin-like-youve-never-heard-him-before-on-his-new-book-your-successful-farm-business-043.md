**[0:01:25-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:01:25):**  Hello and welcome once again to The Abundant Edge podcast.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:01:28):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, but today I'm actually going to try something new and hand  
**[0:01:32-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:01:32):**  this interview over to my good friend and colleague Shad Goodsy, owner of Atitlan Organics.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:01:38):**  Now today I'm super excited to have someone on who I've been wanting to interview since  
**[0:01:42-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:01:42):**  the beginning of this podcast almost a year ago.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:01:45):**  Today we get to talk to Joel Salatin about his new book, Your Successful Farm Business.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:01:51):**  For those of you who are familiar with Joel's work, this might be a lot different from the  
**[0:01:55-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:01:55):**  subject matter that you're used to him talking about.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:01:57):**  This book is a lot heavier on the business and marketing side of a small scale farm and  
**[0:02:03-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:02:03):**  diverse agricultural enterprise.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:02:05):**  But let me first hand things over to Shad and we can go from there.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:02:09):**  Alright so I'm here again with my good friend and colleague Shad Goodsy of Atitlan Organics  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:02:14):**  and I'm actually going to turn the interview over to him this time because he is a long  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:02:18):**  time fan of Joel's work, has read all of his books and has implemented a lot of his advice  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:02:23):**  and teachings from those books on his own farm.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:02:27):**  So Shad tell me a little bit about what you guys got to talk about in this interview.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:02:31):**  Yeah thank you Oliver and thank you for the opportunity to speak with Joel.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:02:35):**  He's definitely a hero of mine and one of the main leaders in the alternative food movement.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:02:43):**  And I think this actually was an awesome interview even according to Joel several times I think  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:02:48):**  was excited by some of the topics we got to dabble in.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:02:54):**  But we really explored a bit about his new book Your Successful Farm Business which he  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:02:59):**  calls a graduate level course where the undergraduate level is You Can Farm.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:03:05):**  And if you haven't read You Can Farm you should check that one out as well.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:03:08):**  But we get into a lot of stuff about observing the land and knowing how to approach a new  
**[0:03:17-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:03:17):**  piece of land.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:03:19):**  About halfway through the interview Joel really walked through his whole kind of start to  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:03:24):**  finish farm design which is really absolutely amazing.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:03:28):**  And in a few short minutes I got to experience a lot of distilled knowledge of all about  
**[0:03:34-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:03:34):**  access and water and control and really hearing it from the horse's mouth was really awesome.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:03:42):**  So we got to touch on farm design and the basics around that.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:03:47):**  We also talked about sales and marketing and how looking at the farm as a business can  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:03:52):**  be a challenge but it's absolutely necessary for the longevity of any sustainable operation.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:03:58):**  So in the book but also in the podcast Joel goes through a couple of great ideas for marketing  
**[0:04:05-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:04:05):**  and why it's absolutely integral to the small farmers success to be capturing most of the  
**[0:04:11-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:04:11):**  retail dollar for their products.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:04:14):**  We talked a bit about farms or farmers who are maybe at the 3 to 8 year mark where they've  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:04:22):**  been doing it and possibly the enthusiasm wears off a little.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:04:27):**  The first few seasons you're carried by the dream of working with the land but then the  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:04:32):**  reality starts to hit and you realize you have to make some changes if you really want  
**[0:04:37-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:04:37):**  to make the business work.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:04:38):**  So especially for people who are considering starting a farm or who have already done it,  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:04:43):**  this is an awesome podcast.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:04:46):**  I actually asked him what are some of the telltale signs of people approaching success  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:04:52):**  that they're close to it after a few seasons but they're just not quite there yet and how  
**[0:04:56-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:04:56):**  can they sense if it's successful and how to really go for it to round that corner.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:05:03):**  He lays out a list that I don't think appears in any of his other books anywhere and he  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:05:08):**  was actually writing it down as he was telling me about it and so you have to listen to get  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:05:13):**  the list but really it's really informative for people who are strongly considering making  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:05:19):**  a living working with the land.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:05:23):**  Marvelous and I know you got to use some of your own examples from your experience farming  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:05:27):**  and where you are at currently with Atitlan Organics that kind of worked as a bit of a  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:05:31):**  case study and gave some context to some of the questions so good job with that.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:05:36):**  I know this is a really information and practical advice heavy episode so if anybody has a notebook  
**[0:05:44-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:05:44):**  on hand you probably want it for this one.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:05:46):**  Why don't we hand things over now to Joel Salatin.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:05:49):**  Sounds great Oliver, thanks a lot.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:05:51):**  All right greetings I'm Shad Goodsy coming at you from Abundant Edge podcast and today  
**[0:05:56-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:05:56):**  we're super excited to be here with Joel Salatin.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:05:59):**  Joel thanks for coming on how you doing today?  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:06:03):**  I'm doing great Shad thank you very much for having me on.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:06:06):**  Awesome yeah so maybe I know your time is short you're a really busy guy so let's just  
**[0:06:11-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:06:11):**  get right into it.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:06:12):**  I want to start for those who don't know you if you could maybe just tell me a bit about  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:06:17):**  your background and briefly how you got into regenerative farming.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:06:23):**  Well I'm second generation here I stand on the shoulders of giants my paternal grandfather  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:06:30):**  was a charter subscriber to Rodale's organic gardening and farming magazine when he first  
**[0:06:36-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:06:36):**  launched the Rodale deal back in about 1949 and my dad got his you know environmental  
**[0:06:45-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:06:45):**  bent from him and I got it from dad so you know here we are I don't have a I don't have  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:06:52):**  a conversion story I've always our family's always been weird and so you know we always  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:06:58):**  said dad was organic before Rachel Carson wrote Silent Spring and dad was a dad was  
**[0:07:04-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:07:04):**  an economist his degree was in economics he did tax accounting and bookkeeping and stuff  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:07:11):**  set up books for people so they could this is before computers and you know quick books  
**[0:07:15-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:07:15):**  and things and he saw the whole chemical you know chemical industrial approach to agriculture  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:07:22):**  is being kind of like a drug addiction and you got a more powerful stuff all the time  
**[0:07:26-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:07:26):**  to get the same kick and it's you know financially you know more expensive all the time and so  
**[0:07:36-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:07:36):**  he came to this whole you know ecological farming approach as much from economics as  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:07:45):**  as he did from from an environmental bent and so you know here we are in Virginia's  
**[0:07:51-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:07:51):**  Shenandoah Valley we we came in 1961 I was just four years old and dad and mom never  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:07:59):**  made a living from the farm he was an accountant mom was a school teacher but they used the  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:08:04):**  off farm you know that the typical off farm income to pay for the farm so that when I  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:08:09):**  got up into high school the farm was paid for and I wanted to stay here but it wasn't  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:08:14):**  it wasn't a going concern and we were not making a salary you know we were making maybe  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:08:19):**  enough to pay the taxes but that was about it and so when Theresa and I got married in  
**[0:08:24-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:08:24):**  1980 you know we really really you know started really brainstorming okay how do we how do  
**[0:08:35-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:08:35):**  we really make a living here and and so we you know we we we had done a lot of experimenting  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:08:43):**  over the years dad had developed a portable electric fencing system so we were moving  
**[0:08:47-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:08:47):**  the cows all the time we knew that that worked very well from a production standpoint and  
**[0:08:54-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:08:54):**  a control standpoint I had had chickens since I was 10 years old and so I enjoyed chickens  
**[0:09:00-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:09:00):**  so we had the two different species I wasn't afraid of hard work and so we we essentially  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:09:09):**  Teresa and I were able to live we lived in the in the attic in the farmhouse you could  
**[0:09:13-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:09:13):**  call it an attic with mud donkeys we called it the penthouse and and in a year we were  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:09:21):**  able to save enough well actually not in a year it was more like two years two years  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:09:26):**  in two years we were able to save enough to live to live for a year without any outside  
**[0:09:32-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:09:32):**  income and as soon as we hit that that that one year nest egg we quit our well she had  
**[0:09:42-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:09:42):**  already we we had our first child so she was at home with Daniel and I quit my town job  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:09:50):**  and came back to the farm fully expecting to run through the the nest egg in a year  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:09:55):**  and and and go back outside for employment but thinking well you know maybe by being  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:10:01):**  here we'll get so many things done and get so much launched in a year that the total  
**[0:10:05-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:10:05):**  time away can be a lot less than what we're expecting and as it turned out you know we  
**[0:10:14-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:10:14):**  we made it you know it we I never went back off farm for off farm employment it was tight  
**[0:10:20-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:10:20):**  you know we drove a $50 car we we lived on 300 bucks a month we you know if we if we  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:10:26):**  didn't grow it we didn't eat it we didn't you know we had our own firewood so we had  
**[0:10:31-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:10:31):**  our own heat and so we just lived we lived extremely cheaply and brutally and course  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:10:39):**  Teresa was you know she was a farm girl and knew how to cook and can and freeze and so  
**[0:10:45-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:10:45):**  and all that and so we were able to live you know as close to cashless as you can imagine  
**[0:10:53-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:10:53):**  in our modern economy and and you know I I emphasize that to everybody because because  
**[0:11:02-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:11:02):**  we are we are today enjoying the leveraging of those early days of frugality and and and  
**[0:11:10-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:11:10):**  not getting you know not getting in debt yeah absolutely I absolutely love your the the  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:11:17):**  story of your family and your background there's lots of gems in there I'm gonna jump ahead  
**[0:11:23-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:11:23):**  because it seems relevant right now but I know you also mentioned that you have interns  
**[0:11:29-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:11:29):**  now and the farm is completely different than maybe what it was 30 years ago and I'm curious  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:11:37):**  you express a concern for example that the interns now only know how to process chickens  
**[0:11:42-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:11:42):**  with eight people teams are you doing anything for your interns or when you speak to people  
**[0:11:49-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:11:49):**  to challenge them if they're in order to start from like a threadbare farm or how do you  
**[0:11:56-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:11:56):**  build that experience into your apprenticeships and interns yeah well I guess the the main  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:12:05):**  thing that we that we build into it that's a great question you know how do you how do  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:12:11):**  you duplicate the threadbare look I mean you yeah the problem is you can't you can't ring  
**[0:12:15-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:12:15):**  a bell now now my wife Teresa had her complete you know way here she would actually have  
**[0:12:22-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:12:22):**  designated days or even multiple days at a time where there would be it would be essentially  
**[0:12:29-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:12:29):**  a machinery a machinery free like a machinery embargo okay nobody rides a four-wheeler we  
**[0:12:37-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:12:37):**  all walk for a day nobody uses a front end loader we use a shovel and a pitchfork you  
**[0:12:44-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:12:44):**  know that sort of thing yeah one of the things that we that we do do for sure like in the  
**[0:12:52-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:12:52):**  poultry processing is everybody everybody becomes proficient on every station so we  
**[0:12:58-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:12:58):**  don't let people just just you know pick their station and stay there everybody has to kill  
**[0:13:04-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:13:04):**  they have to spend a you know a couple days killing everybody has to spend a couple of  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:13:07):**  days you know on the scalder everybody has to spend a couple of days eviscerating and  
**[0:13:12-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:13:12):**  so what we want is to to make sure we rotate around enough to develop proficiency in every  
**[0:13:19-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:13:19):**  facet the other thing that we do is is we put the onus on the interns to to rotate through  
**[0:13:29-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:13:29):**  the different tasks so that by the end of the summer they will have done everything  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:13:37):**  there is to do in other words we don't keep a tick sheet to say well Jane you've you've  
**[0:13:42-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:13:42):**  sorted cattle bill you sort cattle Jim you have it so Jim you come with me no basically  
**[0:13:49-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:13:49):**  it's okay we're going to sort cattle tomorrow who hasn't who hasn't sorted cattle and and  
**[0:13:56-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:13:56):**  it's essentially up to we leave the we leave the onus up to the intern to make sure that  
**[0:14:06-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:14:06):**  they take advantage of every opportunity that there is and you know it's with with the kind  
**[0:14:15-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:14:15):**  of operation we're running it's kind of silly for people to get a hernia when you could  
**[0:14:19-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:14:19):**  just use a front end loader yeah yeah absolutely or uh that sort of thing but you know I still  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:14:28):**  I still take the interns out if you know we've got snapped off post we don't we don't wait  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:14:33):**  and put on the you know we don't put on the hydraulic post pounder we throw a post hole  
**[0:14:37-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:14:37):**  digger shovel and a digging iron in throw a you know throw a uh a post in the in the  
**[0:14:44-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:14:44):**  truck or whatever the four-wheeler and and go up over the field and and uh set the post  
**[0:14:50-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:14:50):**  you know do it like I did 50 years ago and um and you know I remember I remember very  
**[0:14:57-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:14:57):**  well doing this with one of our our interns and she had a master's degree in mathematics  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:15:04):**  uh she was a you know a mid-level manager and a big fortune 500 company doing uh it  
**[0:15:10-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:15:10):**  was a sharp sharp gal and we went out we put this post in and by the time I was done with  
**[0:15:16-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:15:16):**  her she just stopped she said man I had no idea that there was so much technical nuance  
**[0:15:24-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:15:24):**  to running a post hole digger you know putting in a post and um and and I think I think that's  
**[0:15:31-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:15:31):**  that's the important thing to learn and to know is that there is no there's nothing we  
**[0:15:38-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:15:38):**  do here is thoughtless it's all it's all uh you know carefully thought through deal and  
**[0:15:47-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:15:47):**  um you know I I wish we could give everybody a you know a threadbare look uh but it's it's  
**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:15:55):**  it's hard to it's hard to go back completely you know when you have when you have the infrastructure  
**[0:16:00-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:16:00):**  and the and the different things to do yeah absolutely uh and but just even to hear that  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:16:06):**  uh you're practical when you make decisions about is it worth pulling out the big machine  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:16:10):**  when we just have one or two posts to dig um I feel like that gets lost on a lot of  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:16:15):**  people when they have the machinery there uh and I think that's important distinction  
**[0:16:20-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:16:20):**  yeah absolutely I mean I'm I know farmers that um that wouldn't imagine you know setting  
**[0:16:29-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:16:29):**  a post by hand since they have a post pounder yeah but uh but goodness to me setting a post  
**[0:16:36-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:16:36):**  by hand you know takes uh five or ten minutes I mean depending on obviously depending on  
**[0:16:43-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:16:43):**  where you're digging and um and it it'll take it'll take 20 minutes to hook up the post  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:16:50):**  pounder um you're actually a lot better now you know if you're going to set a hundred  
**[0:16:55-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:16:55):**  post that's a different story but if you're but if you're just setting a couple uh it's  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:17:01):**  much more efficient to just go do it by hand and just fire up a machine yeah which touches  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:17:07):**  on a lot about your motion studies that you talk about in this book which I have a few  
**[0:17:12-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:17:12):**  questions about but I think we'll we'll move on for right now um so I guess speaking of  
**[0:17:17-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:17:17):**  the book we're really here today because you have the new book out your successful farm  
**[0:17:23-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:17:23):**  business uh and I'm curious what motivated you to write this book  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:17:31):**  well it's been 20 years since I wrote you can farm and that book has sold extremely  
**[0:17:37-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:17:37):**  well all over the world uh it's been translated into foreign languages too and um and I just  
**[0:17:46-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:17:46):**  you know 20 years I just started feeling like we've tweaked this more we we know more uh  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:17:53):**  my thinking has matured I mean you know I've I've grown too in my own you know uh whatever  
**[0:17:59-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:17:59):**  in your your your maturity of articulating different things and so I I wanted to kind  
**[0:18:14-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:18:14):**  of do a graduate course if you will from you can farm to take it to another level in fact  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:18:20):**  I I thought about calling it you can farm 2.0 but then I was concerned over I call it  
**[0:18:25-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:18:25):**  you can farm 2.0 nobody's gonna buy you can farm 1.0 you know yeah so uh you know I'm  
**[0:18:32-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:18:32):**  always thinking marketing right and so I didn't want to I didn't want to jeopardize the sales  
**[0:18:39-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:18:39):**  of the old you can farm so I I um I wanted to just write the update and and there are  
**[0:18:48-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:18:48):**  as you can see from having looked through it and read it probably yeah uh there are  
**[0:18:54-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:18:54):**  there are just there are just some really cool things you know like like the whole um  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:19:02):**  mobile modular management intensive um you know some of those and the time and motion  
**[0:19:07-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:19:07):**  things that there are you know really critical elements that I don't think I articulated  
**[0:19:14-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:19:14):**  certainly with as much finesse and as much uh you know a practical application in you  
**[0:19:21-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:19:21):**  can farm as as I've done in this one and so this is this is all this I view as as second  
**[0:19:28-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:19:28):**  level read you can farm first and then read this one yeah um and and just to the people  
**[0:19:35-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:19:35):**  folks who are listening uh if you haven't read you can farm that's absolutely uh a masterpiece  
**[0:19:42-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:19:42):**  I have my permaculture library in in the guest house where we host students and uh I have  
**[0:19:49-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:19:49):**  three copies of it on our shelf and it's the first book I tell anyone interested in farming  
**[0:19:53-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:19:53):**  to read but after having read uh your successful farm business the new book I can attest that  
**[0:19:59-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:19:59):**  there's there's practically no repetition it's all fresh information uh sometimes just  
**[0:20:06-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:20:06):**  well articulated what was once maybe just a vague idea prior uh as well as a lot of  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:20:12):**  a lot of changes you've made um maybe even things that you said you weren't doing previously  
**[0:20:17-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:20:17):**  but you are doing now uh so so definitely the combination of the two books is is a great  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:20:23):**  way to put it it's an undergrad and then a graduate level series yeah and you know I  
**[0:20:28-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:20:28):**  would say I would say one other thing she had just to just to flesh that out I also  
**[0:20:34-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:20:34):**  as I travel a lot you know I speak a lot travel a lot teach a lot and I'm always impressed  
**[0:20:41-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:20:41):**  by the lack of of business savvy in the in the farming community now that may be said  
**[0:20:48-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:20:48):**  for all you know all kind of you know uh businesses that that may be but um but I I see a lot  
**[0:20:57-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:20:57):**  in the in the especially this kind of regenerative uh slash permaculture slash healing type of  
**[0:21:07-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:21:07):**  of farming that that we espouse that you and I espouse there's kind of a notion a lot of  
**[0:21:16-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:21:16):**  times that it's so noble it's so righteous it's so it's so good that society owes me  
**[0:21:24-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:21:24):**  a living just because I'm good and and and um and and what happens then is that we we  
**[0:21:36-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:21:36):**  find it easy to develop a bit of a almost an entitlement mentality um you know you should  
**[0:21:44-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:21:44):**  love me just because I'm so lovable because I'm building soil and and and and the result  
**[0:21:50-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:21:50):**  is we become sloppy we become sloppy in our business and and um I I I think that this  
**[0:22:02-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:22:02):**  is a this is a danger and it's weakness and I want us to appreciate that we we have to  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:22:12):**  it's not all business and I hope I make that clear in the book you know it's not all about  
**[0:22:17-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:22:17):**  money by any means but um but you have to think like a business or pretty soon you know  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:22:27):**  you can't pay your taxes and you can't uh yeah you won't be there doing what you're  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:22:32):**  going to do right right yeah no uh you know we touched on a couple of really interesting  
**[0:22:38-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:22:38):**  things there um I think the idea that if you grow uh organic food people will flock to  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:22:46):**  your door to get it is not necessarily true and I think you say that it's flat out in  
**[0:22:51-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:22:51):**  the book um and on top of that a lot of people maybe that are enthused about healing the  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:22:58):**  landscape or building soil are maybe put off by the the extreme capitalism that they're  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:23:04):**  witness to growing up say uh and it's and it's hard to reconcile the two uh but as you  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:23:10):**  said if you aren't making enough to pay the taxes or to pay your team uh you won't be  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:23:16):**  in business for long you won't be able to heal the soil anymore um yeah so so yeah that's  
**[0:23:21-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:23:21):**  right I think I think you're exactly right I think that um that that too often those  
**[0:23:29-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:23:29):**  of you the people like you and I who who come to this we we do have an aversion to the the  
**[0:23:37-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:23:37):**  unbridled immoral capitalism that we see you know that that externalizes cost that abuses  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:23:45):**  uh you know different things as Wendell Berry says you know there's there's more gross domestic  
**[0:23:50-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:23:50):**  product and what's wrong with us than what's right with us and uh and so so yeah there  
**[0:23:56-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:23:56):**  does tend to be an aversion almost uh you know a bad taste in your mouth but um you  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:24:05):**  know there's a balance there too don't let don't let your pendulum swing so far that  
**[0:24:10-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:24:10):**  you become sloppy yeah yeah absolutely um so you know maybe uh just a bit more on this  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:24:19):**  because this was my next question was really a lot of your books in fact most of your books  
**[0:24:24-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:24:24):**  are are a lot about how to or techniques for regenerating the land uh tools of the trade  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:24:32):**  in a sense but this book was really you know quite focused on marketing and sales and and  
**[0:24:38-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:24:38):**  the business aspect of of farming and just maybe a bit more about why is direct marketing  
**[0:24:45-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:24:45):**  so important for small farmers yeah well I think the main reason is that small farmers  
**[0:24:52-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:24:52):**  can't can't generate the volume at a low margin to compete with the commodity program the  
**[0:25:00-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:25:00):**  there's a major difference in kind of protocol uh between a commodity business and a craft  
**[0:25:08-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:25:08):**  business and one of the keys of craft is that you have to that you can do it at low margins  
**[0:25:19-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:25:19):**  I mean because it isn't craft it's not a commodity so you're not just cranking out machine driven  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:25:24):**  widgets you're making a handcrafted widget that's what gives you your distinction and  
**[0:25:30-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:25:30):**  and so in order to do that you have to message it story it you have to differentiate it in  
**[0:25:36-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:25:36):**  order to create a bit of a of an exoticness to it or a specialness to it and and that  
**[0:25:43-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:25:43):**  then gives you a margin so that you can make a living at low volume but higher margin and  
**[0:25:51-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:25:51):**  for for smaller farmers by definition we simply can't this one was one of dad's I remember  
**[0:26:00-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:26:00):**  his one of his first things was we're small farmers we can't we can't run a five hundred  
**[0:26:06-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:26:06):**  thousand dollar combine we can't we can't grow you know five butler bins full of corn  
**[0:26:15-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:26:15):**  all right so so when you're a small farmer you you either you either become a a town  
**[0:26:24-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:26:24):**  job and run the farm on the side and sell commodity or if you want to become a full-time  
**[0:26:33-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:26:33):**  farmer you have to come outside the commodity system and that's and that's why I think wearing  
**[0:26:41-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:26:41):**  all the different hats and we've all heard that the middleman makes all the profits the  
**[0:26:44-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:26:44):**  middleman makes all the money and instead of instead of whatever you know lambasting  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:26:51):**  that notorious middleman when I hear that I say well well you know I raise my hand and  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:26:56):**  say sign me up you know I'll be that little man yeah and I'll wear those hats and anyone  
**[0:27:01-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:27:01):**  anyone who thinks that marketing is easy obviously hasn't done it yet you know we have the if  
**[0:27:11-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:27:11):**  you build it they will come no if you build it they won't come they will only come if  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:27:18):**  you if you tell them a compelling enough reason to come and that of course that goes in the  
**[0:27:23-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:27:23):**  marketing yeah absolutely yeah I have a little story too I remember when I first got into  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:27:29):**  farming I was I was 20 years old I was still in college but I spent the summers on my great  
**[0:27:34-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:27:34):**  uncle's farm which was a 60 acre cabbage farm just monoculture cabbage some chilies in the  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:27:41):**  in the later in the summer and I was cutting cabbages you know 24 to a box from like five  
**[0:27:47-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:27:47):**  in the morning till nine and then they would go to auction and he was getting about 14  
**[0:27:52-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:27:52):**  cents a cabbage and two years later I started a market garden and I was selling my cabbages  
**[0:27:57-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:27:57):**  for three bucks a head and I just remember looking at the math and it's like I have to  
**[0:28:01-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:28:01):**  grow like 30 less 30 times less cabbage you know when I sell them at that price and it's  
**[0:28:09-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:28:09):**  true as a small-scale farmer if you're not hitting the production volume you need to  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:28:15):**  market it and get more of that retail dollar yes that's right and of course as soon as  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:28:20):**  you're as soon as your volume drops guess what else drops your machinery requirement  
**[0:28:25-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:28:25):**  drops your your your your your labor your hired labor and what happens then is yes you're  
**[0:28:32-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:28:32):**  producing more you're producing far fewer heads of cabbage but you are now you are now  
**[0:28:39-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:28:39):**  using your your head your intellectual capacity to be able to become the graphics artist specialist  
**[0:28:47-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:28:47):**  the storyteller the the price setter that you know you're wearing more and more of these  
**[0:28:53-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:28:53):**  middleman hats and and it'll it allows you to instead of having all of your farm what  
**[0:29:05-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:29:05):**  equity in you know in machinery and depreciable assets you're now moving a lot of your equity  
**[0:29:14-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:29:14):**  to to skill and intellectual informational capacity and that becomes much more resilient  
**[0:29:21-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:29:21):**  because no banker can ever foreclose on your skill or your knowledge yeah and even that  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:29:27):**  idea I just love you know for me what you've always stood for is you know farming is not  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:29:32):**  for for the bad students farming isn't just for the people who can't make it in corporate  
**[0:29:38-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:29:38):**  world that farming really to be a good farmer it takes intellect in intelligence and and  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:29:45):**  deep thought about the landscape and about your time and I think just what you said kind  
**[0:29:50-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:29:50):**  of flies in the face of the idea that farming is is a profession for for the not so smart  
**[0:29:56-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:29:56):**  folks you know yeah yeah well you know the the Jeffersonian intellectual agrarian and  
**[0:30:05-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:30:05):**  you know that's that that was his vision for America and and unfortunately we've you know  
**[0:30:14-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:30:14):**  we've moved to a place where we we view farmers as kind of the intellectually disadvantaged  
**[0:30:24-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:30:24):**  yeah and the smart the smart smart kids all have to go to become you know doctors and  
**[0:30:31-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:30:31):**  attorneys and accountants and bankers and IT professionals and and intellectually disadvantaged  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:30:39):**  can well you know you can go be a farmer yeah and I would suggest I would suggest that the  
**[0:30:44-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:30:44):**  level of creativity and and innovative capacity to change the trajectory of our food and farm  
**[0:30:55-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:30:55):**  system is going to take our best and brightest you know why don't guidance counselors say  
**[0:31:04-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:31:04):**  well you're so smart we need you on the farm you know the day the day that statement gets  
**[0:31:12-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:31:12):**  uttered will be the day that we know our culture has hope yeah absolutely so you know you know  
**[0:31:19-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:31:19):**  speaking of that so I really love just the first chapter of this book of the new book  
**[0:31:25-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:31:25):**  your successful farm business really spoke to me it was called working landscapes and  
**[0:31:31-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:31:31):**  if I can preface the question just briefly I think it is changing maybe guidance counselors  
**[0:31:36-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:31:36):**  aren't yet saying oh you're really smart become a farmer but I do think more of maybe the  
**[0:31:43-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:31:43):**  urban nights or the the post college kids are feeling a call to reconnect with the landscape  
**[0:31:49-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:31:49):**  I think you can only be disconnected for so long before your soul kind of yearns for that  
**[0:31:55-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:31:55):**  connection with with the earth what I think happens is is they come with this intellectual  
**[0:32:02-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:32:02):**  capacity but they also bring a fear of disturbing the landscape and I think that partly grows  
**[0:32:10-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:32:10):**  from what they've seen our culture do to the planet for the most part and I just want to  
**[0:32:18-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:32:18):**  quote from the book where you say these hands that can harm can also heal and I just think  
**[0:32:25-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:32:25):**  that's such a beautiful quote and I'd like if you could maybe talk a little bit about  
**[0:32:29-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:32:29):**  the challenges that new farmers face especially if they don't have a farming background when  
**[0:32:36-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:32:36):**  they're confronted with how to change or interact with or reimagine the landscape yeah well  
**[0:32:43-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:32:43):**  that's that's such a good one and thank you yeah that's a very soul level chapter obviously  
**[0:32:51-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:32:51):**  and I think I think that as as new farmers when when we call you know newbies when newbies  
**[0:32:59-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:32:59):**  come to it you have to you have to appreciate that your experience level you don't want  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:33:07):**  to overrun your experience level and I mean this is one of the things I so appreciate  
**[0:33:11-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:33:11):**  about permaculture you know where Bill Mollison always said he said if you get onto a piece  
**[0:33:15-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:33:15):**  of land don't do anything for a year take a notebook walk it walk it one day a month  
**[0:33:21-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:33:21):**  it through every whole year make notes and and and see where where there's wet spots  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:33:28):**  where the dry spots where the the warm tunnels of airflow where the cold tunnels of airflow  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:33:33):**  where do the grit where do the grapevines grow the brambles those sorts of things and  
**[0:33:38-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:33:38):**  and you essentially take notes so that then as you as you develop your plan you are leveraging  
**[0:33:46-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:33:46):**  and you're actually you're you're not you're not assaulting or dominating yeah yeah yeah  
**[0:33:57-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:33:57):**  the kind of natural proclivities of the land and and so I'm a big believer in function  
**[0:34:04-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:34:04):**  driving form doesn't mean I hate art but it but it does mean that that the best art is  
**[0:34:11-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:34:11):**  art that that has purpose that has practical application and functionality and so I'm certainly  
**[0:34:21-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:34:21):**  a big believer in mentors you know most counselors get get people who know more than you out  
**[0:34:26-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:34:26):**  there to take a look at it but but but realize realize I think that until you actually you  
**[0:34:36-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:34:36):**  know start pouring concrete everything can be changed and so do things gently at the  
**[0:34:45-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:34:45):**  beginning I talk about fencing for example if you don't know where to run fence don't  
**[0:34:50-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:34:50):**  make anything permanent don't make anything permanent and then whatever whatever you haven't  
**[0:34:55-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:34:55):**  moved in three years make that permanent and what will happen is you'll find that well  
**[0:35:01-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:35:01):**  I wish I had a cut this corner a little bit tighter or I wish I'd have maybe you know  
**[0:35:07-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:35:07):**  this this opening this gate opening should be over here 20 feet and the problem is that  
**[0:35:13-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:35:13):**  you can't you can't google experience yeah and so and so the the key to a lot of this  
**[0:35:21-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:35:21):**  wonderful you know lightweight portable mobile infrastructure and and control mechanisms  
**[0:35:28-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:35:28):**  shelters and and and electric fence and water pipe and that sort of thing you know Darren  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:35:35):**  Dougherty who's a you know a Darby probably the number one water guru in the world right  
**[0:35:40-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:35:40):**  now he says he says when you start laying water waterline don't don't don't bury it  
**[0:35:48-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:35:48):**  for at least a year maybe two that allows it to go through hot summers and cold winters  
**[0:35:55-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:35:55):**  and do the you know the expansion and the contraction thing make sure all your couplings  
**[0:35:59-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:35:59):**  are good and then after a year or two then bury it and and because as long as it's on  
**[0:36:06-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:36:06):**  top of the ground it's easy to move oh I wish I had to run it down around this hill you  
**[0:36:11-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:36:11):**  know instead of up down through that valley for example and and and you can change it  
**[0:36:18-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:36:18):**  once that once you slice into the ground and bury that pot it's pretty much there there's  
**[0:36:23-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:36:23):**  not much you can not much you can do about changing it and so so you know a lot of this  
**[0:36:30-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:36:30):**  this this gentle gentle infrastructure let let the the let your experience level move  
**[0:36:38-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:36:38):**  with the infrastructure don't lock yourself in to a bunch of stuff I mean for that matter  
**[0:36:44-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:36:44):**  don't even build a house for a couple years live in a yurt live in a live in a caravan  
**[0:36:48-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:36:48):**  of a mobile home okay and does the wind blow you over is this a good location is this does  
**[0:36:57-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:36:57):**  this work with the hub of the operation you know all those kinds of things keep keep yourself  
**[0:37:03-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:37:03):**  malleable and work with the landscape before you know before you you sink yourself in yeah  
**[0:37:11-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:37:11):**  absolutely I think you know just and even relating back to the newbies who don't have  
**[0:37:18-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:37:18):**  the experience yet I think it's really easy to think of a landscape as permanent like  
**[0:37:25-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:37:25):**  oh I this trees here it's always been here it will always be here or you know just to  
**[0:37:31-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:37:31):**  understand that like you said if you're not pouring concrete pretty much everything is  
**[0:37:35-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:37:35):**  still changeable and I think that's a liberating feeling to just know like I can try this make  
**[0:37:41-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:37:41):**  a mistake as long as it only really cost my time I can change it around and not have much  
**[0:37:48-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:37:48):**  loss and just to gain an experience and knowledge so the impermanence of the landscape is actually  
**[0:37:56-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:37:56):**  I think an empowering piece of wisdom that a lot this is lost on a lot of newbies for  
**[0:38:01-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:38:01):**  sure yes yes I couldn't agree more and and when you talk about efficiency and roads and  
**[0:38:09-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:38:09):**  access you know that that's a big one you know oh no I'm gonna cut in with a bulldozer  
**[0:38:15-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:38:15):**  and actually you know move soil and create access but but efficient access is is foundational  
**[0:38:24-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:38:24):**  to the efficiency of the entire operation and if and if you can't if you can't go to  
**[0:38:28-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:38:28):**  that back three acres because you know you know nine months out of the year because you  
**[0:38:34-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:38:34):**  go through a boggy mud hole and you're afraid you get stuck basically those three acres  
**[0:38:41-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:38:41):**  are are inaccessible you know that they might as well be somebody else's and and so some  
**[0:38:48-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:38:48):**  you know some terrain development that the whole idea I think I say in the book that  
**[0:38:53-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:38:53):**  it takes a lot of faith to assume that every every single piece of terrain whenever the  
**[0:39:04-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:39:04):**  land fell together from last volcano earthquake tectonic shift what have you whatever whatever  
**[0:39:13-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:39:13):**  movement was to assume that that movement is is the best and the most perfect situation  
**[0:39:23-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:39:23):**  frankly takes a you know takes a lot of faith and and I think I think it actually takes  
**[0:39:30-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:39:30):**  maybe even a little less faith to think well we can you know we can massage this we can  
**[0:39:36-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:39:36):**  we can caress it and we can you know we can put a little dam across this valley so the  
**[0:39:44-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:39:44):**  water doesn't just drain off and when you start doing that so that's again one of the  
**[0:39:50-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:39:50):**  things I love about permaculture is that it that it dares to to ask this question can  
**[0:39:59-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:39:59):**  we can we caress the landscape into into a better functional make a more functional system  
**[0:40:10-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:40:10):**  than whatever the terrain you know fell together as so many years ago yeah I you know I wanted  
**[0:40:17-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:40:17):**  to just add when you say that idea that the way it fell through nature is the best way  
**[0:40:22-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:40:22):**  it could be is not only requires a lot of faith I think it also requires an elimination  
**[0:40:29-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:40:29):**  of the human from the landscape yeah yeah what you talk about as well I had to laugh  
**[0:40:36-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:40:36):**  a little or did you want to say something well just yeah I call it I call it abandonment  
**[0:40:44-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:40:44):**  environmentalism environmentalism by abandonment as opposed to environmentalism by participation  
**[0:40:50-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:40:50):**  yeah those are the those are the two big differences yeah absolutely and that's an incredible distinction  
**[0:40:56-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:40:56):**  that I think just is not clear to a lot of people who are fighting for the earth and  
**[0:41:03-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:41:03):**  they think removing people from it is is the way to go and I'm starkly against that belief  
**[0:41:08-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:41:08):**  and I think you do a great job in the book speaking of that as well yeah I had to laugh  
**[0:41:14-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:41:14):**  because literally the next follow-up question was in permaculture there's a saying that  
**[0:41:20-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:41:20):**  you should live on a piece of land for at least one year before you do anything permanent  
**[0:41:24-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:41:24):**  you know and you brought it up but that leads me to a question you know I just read it out  
**[0:41:30-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:41:30):**  it says this highlights the importance of observation and of learning what the land  
**[0:41:34-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:41:34):**  has to say throughout the seasons and the changes in the weather and the people patterns  
**[0:41:40-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:41:40):**  and I was hoping maybe you could speak a little bit about how you observe a new parcel on  
**[0:41:46-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:41:46):**  your farm or if you rent a new farm I know you have a lot more experience but is there  
**[0:41:51-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:41:51):**  still a process that you go through do you still wait a full year or or how do you tackle  
**[0:41:56-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:41:56):**  a new farm design oh that's that that's a great question yeah we do we do lease about  
**[0:42:05-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:42:05):**  eight properties so we're in fact we're we're as we speak this moment we have a big two  
**[0:42:13-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:42:13):**  big pieces of excavation equipment over at the newest farm that we've just leased putting  
**[0:42:18-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:42:18):**  it up putting in a pond below a spring in a it's also a pretty large catchment basin  
**[0:42:26-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:42:26):**  and that will that will gravity feed to a cistern that's going to go down to the farm  
**[0:42:30-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:42:30):**  hub where there'll be power and then and then we'll pump that water from the fissure pump  
**[0:42:36-0:42:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:42:36):**  that water through around the whole farm because there's not a there's not a high enough spot  
**[0:42:41-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:42:41):**  to get a get enough water catchment to to get enough gravity pressure yeah on the whole  
**[0:42:49-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:42:49):**  place so we kind of split the difference we we build a high pond we gravity feed to a  
**[0:42:54-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:42:54):**  cistern that's that's at about the midpoint of the farm and then we're not so far downhill  
**[0:43:00-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:43:00):**  we can't pump it back up to the clear to the top way above the pond and obviously we can  
**[0:43:06-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:43:06):**  you know we can get it to the to the lower section so um yeah we've we've developed oh  
**[0:43:12-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:43:12):**  goodness you know 12 you know 12 properties over the over the last few years and so you  
**[0:43:18-0:43:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:43:18):**  know we've gotten obviously when you when you do that many you start getting a lot more  
**[0:43:24-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:43:24):**  proficient at it you you can go in you can read a landscape and you can put the fences  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:43:29):**  in the right place the very first time you can put the water line in the right place  
**[0:43:33-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:43:33):**  at the very first time put the corral in the right place at the very first time um and  
**[0:43:38-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:43:38):**  so we've become very good at it so so the way i approach up you know a piece of land  
**[0:43:44-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:43:44):**  is um is that there are there are certain givens uh i call them givens i mean you could  
**[0:43:51-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:43:51):**  call them necessaries or whatever but there's some you know there's there's some things  
**[0:43:56-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:43:56):**  you can't change i mean obviously you you're not going to make a valley a ridgetop you're  
**[0:44:01-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:44:01):**  not going to make a ridgetop of valley all right so they're they're this is all within  
**[0:44:06-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:44:06):**  you know within limits and so the first thing the first thing you need is access if you  
**[0:44:13-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:44:13):**  don't have if you can't get there if you if you can't get there you can't do anything  
**[0:44:18-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:44:18):**  with it and so i view access as kind of the number one thing so access obviously you don't  
**[0:44:23-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:44:23):**  want it to be too steep um and if you go through a wet spot you have to get drainage you have  
**[0:44:29-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:44:29):**  to you know get culvert my favorite going through a you know a valley or a wet spot  
**[0:44:35-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:44:35):**  is uh rather than putting a culvert in i i put a pond there and then we drive over the  
**[0:44:41-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:44:41):**  pond dam and put the culvert in the top of the dam instead of down at the bottom of the  
**[0:44:46-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:44:46):**  ditch you don't have to move any more dirt but instead of just having a drainage now  
**[0:44:51-0:44:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:44:51):**  you have a pond that you're driving over the dam and um and so so we do that you know routinely  
**[0:44:59-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:44:59):**  and um and that's all part of getting an access once you have an access then that access becomes  
**[0:45:07-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:45:07):**  the main artery for your livestock movement your uh your your you know your your trucking  
**[0:45:14-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:45:14):**  you're going to the woods bringing firewood whatever whatever transportation you've got  
**[0:45:19-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:45:19):**  going across the place is going to go on that artery which means that we put electric fence  
**[0:45:25-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:45:25):**  we've so we put a fence on both sides of that artery and we don't put it real real close  
**[0:45:30-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:45:30):**  we we we try to make these you know 20 feet apart um so that we've got room on the edges  
**[0:45:38-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:45:38):**  to you know you can let trees come you can let the edges get nice and healed up with  
**[0:45:44-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:45:44):**  berm you you you i mean you can um you've got a little bit of edge there it's been my  
**[0:45:49-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:45:49):**  point if you if you run the if you run the fence right up against your grade your road  
**[0:45:56-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:45:56):**  you don't have you don't have little room uh to to to make maintenance or keep your  
**[0:46:04-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:46:04):**  water bars up that sort of thing um and so you know your broad base dips your water bars  
**[0:46:09-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:46:09):**  and things are all part of you know getting the you know getting keep the water off the  
**[0:46:13-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:46:13):**  road remember uh that what what maintains a road is getting the water off so you don't  
**[0:46:18-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:46:18):**  want any velocity and you don't want any volume volume and velocity or what killer road so  
**[0:46:23-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:46:23):**  keep that in mind when you put in your water bars broad base dips and how you're you know  
**[0:46:27-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:46:27):**  putting it through um so you got that you got your fence on both sides well then that  
**[0:46:32-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:46:32):**  because then then on one of those you're going to run your water line um because you can  
**[0:46:37-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:46:37):**  always put a you know put a hose across the road when you've got livestock on the other  
**[0:46:41-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:46:41):**  side so now we've got access we've got our our basics of control the the fencing and  
**[0:46:49-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:46:49):**  then the water and then the water and um so so you know those are those are your three  
**[0:46:55-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:46:55):**  you know kind of key uh components then then if the then beyond that then we're looking  
**[0:47:01-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:47:01):**  at critical area so now beyond that we're looking at number one riparian areas okay  
**[0:47:07-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:47:07):**  so right here we don't want the cows in the creek we don't want the pigs down in the water  
**[0:47:10-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:47:10):**  so now we're going to fence out the what we call the uh you know critical uh you know  
**[0:47:18-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:47:18):**  areas that need protection like riparian areas yeah uh maybe a wood lot uh anything like  
**[0:47:23-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:47:23):**  that okay so now we're going to protect those areas we're going to fence those out and once  
**[0:47:28-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:47:28):**  we have that then if the fields are still too big and the rule of thumb there is um  
**[0:47:35-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:47:35):**  is you don't want you don't want to have any field where your your temporary portable uh  
**[0:47:43-0:47:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:47:43):**  fence is going to be more than about 250 yards that's about all the fence you can carry and  
**[0:47:50-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:47:50):**  the stakes you can carry in your hand okay so 250 yards is kind of a rule of thumb uh  
**[0:47:56-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:47:56):**  for how long you want so if you've got fields that are longer than that then you're going  
**[0:48:01-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:48:01):**  to want to subdivide those and you'll want to do that on the terrain to create homogeneity  
**[0:48:07-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:48:07):**  in your different fields so you have south aspects together north aspects together valleys  
**[0:48:13-0:48:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:48:13):**  together ridge tops together because all of those grow at different rates and they have  
**[0:48:19-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:48:19):**  different kinds of vegetation and so in order to uh to to manage the grazing properly you  
**[0:48:27-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:48:27):**  don't want too much uh dissimilarity in a given in a good paddock you want a lot of  
**[0:48:34-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:48:34):**  similarity in a given paddock um so that the vegetation is going to grow similarly it'll  
**[0:48:41-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:48:41):**  get dry or really wet that sort of thing and and so you know that's that's the way that's  
**[0:48:48-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:48:48):**  the way we approach it of course every place is every place is a little different but um  
**[0:48:53-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:48:53):**  but i like i like going with with givers like that uh because if you if you just go and  
**[0:49:02-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:49:02):**  you're just thinking kind of a shotgun approach well look at all i have to do here you you're  
**[0:49:09-0:49:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:49:09):**  you're um you know you have what we call um you know paralysis by analysis yes yeah and  
**[0:49:17-0:49:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:49:17):**  if you just start with what you know well i know i've got to get i've got to get from  
**[0:49:21-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:49:21):**  here to the back side of the property i know i have to do that or i'm never going to use  
**[0:49:25-0:49:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:49:25):**  it well then so a given is we need access yeah a given is the act the access is multiple  
**[0:49:33-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:49:33):**  use you don't want the access to be a single use so we're going to fence the access so  
**[0:49:39-0:49:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:49:39):**  we can have multiple it can be used for livestock machinery walking trail whatever and then  
**[0:49:46-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:49:46):**  and then we need water without water you have no life so you develop your water your water  
**[0:49:52-0:50:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:49:52):**  runs along the lane and those and that gives you a very specific practical systematic way  
**[0:50:01-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:50:01):**  to you know to put in you know kind of the what i call the major development landscape  
**[0:50:06-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:50:06):**  development components notice i haven't said anything about a house yeah that's the same  
**[0:50:10-0:50:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:50:10):**  about barn that's the thing about a tool shed you know none of that stuff that will come  
**[0:50:18-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:50:18):**  that will come after you get what i've described in once you get that in then it will begin  
**[0:50:24-0:50:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:50:24):**  to come apparent well where's a natural hub where's a natural you know confluence of things  
**[0:50:31-0:50:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:50:31):**  and and that's where they want to develop your you know your zone one absolutely wow  
**[0:50:37-0:50:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:50:37):**  yeah just uh that thank you for that um i just feel in those three minutes you just  
**[0:50:42-0:50:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:50:42):**  transferred a really a large amount of distilled knowledge um i think earlier in the interview  
**[0:50:49-0:50:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:50:49):**  you said there's a lot of deep thought that goes into it uh and it's obvious when you  
**[0:50:54-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:50:54):**  describe that sort of thing it may look so simple and elegant when it's finished but  
**[0:51:00-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:51:00):**  but the level of understanding that goes into the decisions that are made is distilled through  
**[0:51:05-0:51:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:51:05):**  lots of experience so that's really really cool uh i want to i'm going to jump ahead  
**[0:51:12-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:51:12):**  and then kind of circle back because i feel like it's a it's a good time i want to just  
**[0:51:17-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:51:17):**  briefly describe my farm um and and i think we'll tie into some of the themes of the book  
**[0:51:24-0:51:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:51:24):**  but we're located in a really high tourist area on one of the most beautiful lakes in  
**[0:51:30-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:51:30):**  guatemala the land is uh about two and a half acres and it's super rocky it's in uh the  
**[0:51:37-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:51:37):**  river bottom uh loads of rocks uh we're quite diverse we focus on animal products so we  
**[0:51:44-0:51:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:51:44):**  do broilers laying hens we also range dairy goats on public land so not on the two and  
**[0:51:50-0:51:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:51:50):**  a half acres we do honey and then uh salads and micro greens uh so we've been here for  
**[0:51:57-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:51:57):**  about eight years we're still going strong um managing to pay the bills but still not  
**[0:52:04-0:52:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:52:04):**  a salary i would like for myself um aside from the cash flow which is our number one  
**[0:52:10-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:52:10):**  challenge uh i see this constant battle between production and marketing um and some years  
**[0:52:18-0:52:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:52:18):**  i feel like we over produce and we have to eat inventory but then other years uh we we  
**[0:52:24-0:52:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:52:24):**  are our production maybe fails to satisfy the markets and bring in the easy cash that's  
**[0:52:29-0:52:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:52:29):**  there um and i know in one of your earlier books you said that nature will reward even  
**[0:52:35-0:52:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:52:35):**  the most feeble attempts at production but i still feel like i'm on this constant struggle  
**[0:52:40-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:52:40):**  with being able to produce enough versus marketing too much and not being able to deliver um  
**[0:52:48-0:52:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:52:48):**  and i wonder if you see that maybe not in your farm but when you when you visit other  
**[0:52:53-0:52:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:52:53):**  maybe farmers who are in the maybe three to eight year mark uh do they have do you see  
**[0:52:59-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:52:59):**  this challenge and how do you manage it this balance between marketing and production  
**[0:53:04-0:53:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:53:04):**  uh one of the one of the biggest uh biggest questions um that that indicates a great deal  
**[0:53:13-0:53:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:53:13):**  of you know of of experience on your own so um yeah this is this is a very telling question  
**[0:53:19-0:53:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:53:19):**  um and and i wish i had i wish i had a cookie cutter answer i don't have a square plus b  
**[0:53:26-0:53:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:53:26):**  squared equals c squared you know i wish i had a nice little formula for it but i will  
**[0:53:30-0:53:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:53:30):**  i will tell you this yes inventory control managing those two things um what we think  
**[0:53:37-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:53:37):**  of as inventory control between production and your marketing is you know is a big is  
**[0:53:44-0:53:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:53:44):**  a big deal and trust me even the big guys don't do it extremely well um i mean at least  
**[0:53:51-0:53:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:53:51):**  at least biologically um you know we in a factory system managing inventory is a little  
**[0:53:59-0:54:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:53:59):**  easier because you don't have perishability but as soon as as soon as you kick this perishability  
**[0:54:05-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:54:05):**  thing into it uh and the more perishable something is you know the the more the more difficult  
**[0:54:11-0:54:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:54:11):**  it is so um so that's one reason why it's good if you're if you're running a farm business  
**[0:54:20-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:54:20):**  to have aspects that are perishable and aspects that aren't perishable and the and well for  
**[0:54:29-0:54:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:54:29):**  obvious reasons the the parish will keep a long time and it'll maintain cash flow uh  
**[0:54:35-0:54:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:54:35):**  as your perishable you know can can ebb and flow um which includes and of course sometimes  
**[0:54:42-0:54:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:54:42):**  you can take very perishable products and make them imperishable through either dehydration  
**[0:54:47-0:54:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:54:47):**  canning freezing value adding you know uh all sorts of ways that you can make something  
**[0:54:54-0:54:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:54:54):**  perishable into something important this is what this is what drove um cheese making in  
**[0:54:58-0:55:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:54:58):**  the swiss Alps right was was milk was very perishable cheese wasn't it was it was more  
**[0:55:05-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:55:05):**  it was more uh dollar it was more valuable per pound so when you're turning it off the  
**[0:55:11-0:55:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:55:11):**  mountain you want to tote off you want to tote off imperishable high value cheese you  
**[0:55:16-0:55:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:55:16):**  don't want to tote off a bunch of cans of fluid milk and yeah and so you know so so  
**[0:55:22-0:55:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:55:22):**  this sort of so a balance and what you've described here is a you know interesting balance  
**[0:55:27-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:55:27):**  uh you know eggs are kind of a extra kind of a a limbo here they're they're somewhat  
**[0:55:33-0:55:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:55:33):**  perishable but they're not real perishable you know so they're kind of a a hybrid uh  
**[0:55:37-0:55:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:55:37):**  in some of these other things so um this this inventory management is what has driven many  
**[0:55:45-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:55:45):**  many people to community supported agriculture or some sort of a a subscription scheme so  
**[0:55:51-0:55:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:55:51):**  that you have subscribers and you know what's you know what's going on and in fact this  
**[0:55:58-0:56:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:55:58):**  is why for example amazon prime uh has deep discounts for its membership because because  
**[0:56:09-0:56:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:56:09):**  in the algorithms that they use uh you know and i just heard an interesting report the  
**[0:56:13-0:56:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:56:13):**  other day did you know did you know that that every single google search that you've ever  
**[0:56:20-0:56:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:56:20):**  done can be brought up by google in profiling you so so just imagine every time you've ever  
**[0:56:30-0:56:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:56:30):**  you've ever put in your search your search uh square something forever google has that  
**[0:56:39-0:56:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:56:39):**  information wow and they of course they they sell it to amazon so what i'm getting at is  
**[0:56:45-0:56:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:56:45):**  the the algorithms for customer profiling are are just are astronomically more sophisticated  
**[0:56:54-0:57:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:56:54):**  than you and i can imagine and and so that's why these big outfits give deep discounts  
**[0:57:02-0:57:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:57:02):**  for the people who join and subscribe and and and utilize them um why there's you know  
**[0:57:09-0:57:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:57:09):**  the airlines you have loyalty points and all this is because they know that that's that's  
**[0:57:17-0:57:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:57:17):**  part of their inventory control yeah because they know they've got these people and and  
**[0:57:24-0:57:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:57:24):**  so you and i as small businesses we need you know we need that same buffering and so at  
**[0:57:32-0:57:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:57:32):**  our farm you know we do we do loyalty points um and and we have loyalty cards uh you know  
**[0:57:40-0:57:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:57:40):**  when you buy 500 worth of stuff you get a 10 percent uh 10 what is it um yeah it's essentially  
**[0:57:52-0:57:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:57:52):**  a 10 loyalty uh program uh when you've spent 500 and you get the 10 punches on your card  
**[0:57:58-0:58:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:57:58):**  then you get 50 a 50 free merchandise the next time you you purchase um and and what  
**[0:58:06-0:58:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:58:06):**  and all all of that is is a way to kind of chart describe and and and even intuitively  
**[0:58:15-0:58:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:58:15):**  watch your um you know your your your sales so that you're not just uh whatever starting  
**[0:58:25-0:58:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:58:25):**  from scratch all the time you're you're you know you've got some continuity there and  
**[0:58:29-0:58:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:58:29):**  you've got some um uh some stuff you can count on yeah exactly and and um so so one of the  
**[0:58:41-0:58:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:58:41):**  one of the best things i know for um you know for inventory control is to mesh your value  
**[0:58:51-0:59:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:58:51):**  adding your value added components with your um you know with your your inventory issues  
**[0:59:00-0:59:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:59:00):**  so if you could for example if you're if you could make um quiche you can make quiche from  
**[0:59:08-0:59:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:59:08):**  extra green extra micro green and eggs and freeze quiche as a as a heat heat and eat  
**[0:59:16-0:59:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:59:16):**  meal for example that that meshes up an inventory control if you can turn for example extra  
**[0:59:25-0:59:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:59:25):**  spring eggs i rose here in guamali close to the equator you don't have the fluctuations  
**[0:59:30-0:59:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:59:30):**  that we have here in egg production we have you know a lot of fluctuations between spring  
**[0:59:35-0:59:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:59:35):**  and fall egg production if we turn if you turn the the spring flush of eggs for example  
**[0:59:40-0:59:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:59:40):**  into noodles that don't require any information any refrigeration and you can turn those into  
**[0:59:47-0:59:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:59:47):**  noodles and just and just put those by and let them build up during the spring then you  
**[0:59:53-1:00:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=0:59:53):**  have noodles to sell all year long from that spring flush of eggs you know when you when  
**[1:00:00-1:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:00:00):**  you mesh when you mesh imperishable value added with the very perishable it helps to  
**[1:00:08-1:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:00:08):**  even out that inventory flow um in a very in a very practical way beyond that um none  
**[1:00:17-1:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:00:17):**  of us has it figured out but believe me i mean it's there's nobody nobody i know not  
**[1:00:23-1:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:00:23):**  even amazon has a good has a good handle that's why there are sales in the grocery store that's  
**[1:00:30-1:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:00:30):**  why because you know inventory is a is you know is a big deal to manage it's all it's  
**[1:00:38-1:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:00:38):**  also why it's also why you have to set your normal price high enough to handle the salvage  
**[1:00:49-1:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:00:49):**  because there will there absolutely will be salvage times throughout the year and and  
**[1:00:55-1:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:00:55):**  you can't operate on salvage so um so unless you have a way to salvage at a very high return  
**[1:01:06-1:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:01:06):**  you have to get enough for your prime stuff to be able to carry the salvage price and  
**[1:01:12-1:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:01:12):**  not feel bad about about a salvage price right that's that's interesting um so yeah that's  
**[1:01:19-1:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:01:19):**  actually a few really good ideas uh and i and i appreciate that and and i think you also you get  
**[1:01:25-1:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:01:25):**  like almost like a twofer because not only do you handle the inventory by value adding and making  
**[1:01:32-1:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:01:32):**  something perishable into something imperishable but you also potentially raise your your your  
**[1:01:38-1:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:01:38):**  uh your product price when it's value added into something yeah something yeah yeah absolutely  
**[1:01:46-1:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:01:46):**  and the chances are in guatemala you don't have quite as many uh regulations as we have in the u.s.  
**[1:01:53-1:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:01:53):**  absolutely i you know i was i'm fighting the urge to talk a lot about my farm while i have you here  
**[1:02:00-1:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:02:00):**  but but that is definitely one thing uh we have we have no regulations so we do dairy uh we sell  
**[1:02:06-1:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:02:06):**  raw milk and we make cheese and uh we have i have a you know we have a kitchen that we can pump out  
**[1:02:13-1:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:02:13):**  commercial products if we want to um so yeah we we've over not overcome but we're not saddled with  
**[1:02:20-1:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:02:20):**  a lot of the bureaucracy that i think a lot of farmers in the united states struggle with and  
**[1:02:26-1:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:02:26):**  that's for sure that's correct yeah so i also just like kind of sticking along these lines because i  
**[1:02:32-1:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:02:32):**  do think thinking of your new book uh your successful farm business as a graduate level  
**[1:02:39-1:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:02:39):**  book not to say that people without farming experience shouldn't read it it's a great read  
**[1:02:44-1:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:02:44):**  for anyone interested in the field but but i think it also speaks really powerfully to people who are  
**[1:02:50-1:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:02:50):**  already kind of in the game you know um and i'm curious uh like do you see ever the situation may  
**[1:03:01-1:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:03:01):**  be small scale farmer in this in the three to six or three to eight year timeline already in it and  
**[1:03:09-1:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:03:09):**  i know you've said in other books you watch so many businesses just throw in the towel right  
**[1:03:14-1:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:03:14):**  before they're about to turn the corner to success um what's the opposite of that like is there a  
**[1:03:21-1:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:03:21):**  moment where you see a lot like a pattern where there's a new investment all right the idealism  
**[1:03:27-1:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:03:27):**  of the first few seasons wears off we know we have something because the sales are there and  
**[1:03:33-1:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:03:33):**  the productions there and i still enjoy the work but but uh maybe it's like you need to really make  
**[1:03:39-1:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:03:39):**  it serious and maybe it's an investment in some more infrastructure um or something like that like  
**[1:03:46-1:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:03:46):**  like instead of someone throwing in the towel when it gets challenging around year five or six what  
**[1:03:51-1:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:03:51):**  is the alternative and do you see a pattern where where uh new infrastructure or just taking it to  
**[1:03:57-1:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:03:57):**  the next level and how does that look yeah how it looks wow that's such a another your your  
**[1:04:03-1:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:04:03):**  questions are just wonderful i do a lot of these and it's so great when i when i get really really  
**[1:04:09-1:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:04:09):**  new questions and and you're you're you're you're just hitting some really neat ones even ones that  
**[1:04:16-1:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:04:16):**  i haven't thought of for a good while so you're pulling out of me stuff that i don't normally  
**[1:04:20-1:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:04:20):**  talk about um thank you and yeah and uh so on this question i i think there are there are telltale  
**[1:04:29-1:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:04:29):**  signs i i think one is when a when a person first recognizes that they can't do it all uh yeah i  
**[1:04:39-1:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:04:39):**  think in the book i say all the gifts and talents necessary to run a successful business don't grow  
**[1:04:44-1:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:04:44):**  on the same pair of legs yeah and so one of the one of the if we were if we were laying down like  
**[1:04:51-1:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:04:51):**  one of the telltale signs that somebody's turned that corner at five or six years and they're gonna  
**[1:04:55-1:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:04:55):**  and they're gonna make a thriving business um i think i think the first one is that they begin  
**[1:05:03-1:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:05:03):**  looking for partners and i'm using the word partners loosely it could be an employee it  
**[1:05:10-1:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:05:10):**  could be a subcontractor it could it could be a formal partner but they start looking for for  
**[1:05:15-1:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:05:15):**  complimentary partners because they now suddenly realize i i don't have the talent i don't have the  
**[1:05:24-1:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:05:24):**  time to do everything that has to be done and i need people that are good at stuff that i'm not  
**[1:05:30-1:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:05:30):**  good at if you if you've looked at the the business stuff from called strength finders  
**[1:05:36-1:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:05:36):**  the basic supposition is that rather than that you and i working on our weaknesses we actually  
**[1:05:44-1:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:05:44):**  leverage a lot more by working on our by by by leveraging our strengths and finding somebody  
**[1:05:51-1:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:05:51):**  else that is strong where we're weak you've always heard well you know keep trying to better yourself  
**[1:05:59-1:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:05:59):**  you know work on what you're not good at and the whole idea of strength finders is forget working  
**[1:06:06-1:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:06:06):**  on what you're not good at you don't like it anyway you're not good at it anyway instead  
**[1:06:09-1:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:06:09):**  tweak refine leverage what you are good at what you do enjoy and then bring on a partner that  
**[1:06:18-1:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:06:18):**  complements you in the stuff that you don't enjoy and you're not good at so i i think if you want to  
**[1:06:24-1:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:06:24):**  just put partner yeah as a you know as a benchmark um i think number number two would be um the you  
**[1:06:38-1:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:06:38):**  you mentioned the word investment i think that's a good one um i'll simply use the word efficiency  
**[1:06:44-1:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:06:44):**  um another benchmark is when somebody begins truly doing this time motion stuff to to look  
**[1:06:54-1:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:06:54):**  at efficiency when they start making a map for example of where did i walk today where did i  
**[1:07:00-1:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:07:00):**  double walk and where did i walk without carrying anything yeah when you see a person get serious  
**[1:07:09-1:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:07:09):**  about efficiency um you know you know now they're starting to think like a business because you know  
**[1:07:19-1:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:07:19):**  when you're when you're kind of running a hobby or a passion you do it because it's altruistic you  
**[1:07:27-1:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:07:27):**  you do it because it feeds your soul but when you turn that hobby or passion into a business a day  
**[1:07:34-1:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:07:34):**  comes when you realize i really like this business i want this business to thrive now what do i need  
**[1:07:41-1:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:07:41):**  to do and you start thinking of actual actual business kind of thing which is efficiency you  
**[1:07:48-1:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:07:48):**  know the lean the lean pharma concept of the stuff that you know uh john martin fortier is talking  
**[1:07:55-1:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:07:55):**  about or or that um uh the the why am i why am i blank on the the fellow in maine you know the guru  
**[1:08:06-1:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:08:06):**  oh elliot coleman elliott coleman um uh senior moment there elliott coleman you know the stuff  
**[1:08:13-1:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:08:13):**  that he does you know he and and and along with efficiency i'll just add here um margins margins  
**[1:08:22-1:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:08:22):**  become the next benchmark and you know the reason that elliot doesn't grow corn is because it  
**[1:08:28-1:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:08:28):**  doesn't make margin per square foot and um yeah sweet corn uh and and when you go to when you go  
**[1:08:38-1:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:08:38):**  to elliot you say you know what's your margin on a on a foot of carrot he knows yeah he knows and  
**[1:08:46-1:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:08:46):**  so so the the financial element this this this accounting stuff where you start actually keeping  
**[1:08:52-1:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:08:52):**  records and you're doing you know monthly p&l statements and you're watching your cash flow  
**[1:08:58-1:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:08:58):**  that whole margins you know maybe we could just call this um i'm just thinking out loud here uh  
**[1:09:04-1:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:09:04):**  because i'm actually developing this list i'll write this down for myself because it's a good  
**[1:09:08-1:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:09:08):**  list um i'll just i'll just call it you know um margins and financial um you know when you  
**[1:09:18-1:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:09:18):**  when you start when you start looking at that more than once a year and you're looking at that flow  
**[1:09:24-1:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:09:24):**  through the through the year um that's another kind of telltale sign that you're starting to  
**[1:09:30-1:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:09:30):**  look at it uh that you're going to turn the corner and and you know what the truth is you know and i  
**[1:09:38-1:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:09:38):**  know a lot of people never arrive at any of these yeah absolutely they never arrive but the ones who  
**[1:09:45-1:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:09:45):**  do the ones who do when they arrive at this point you can be pretty sure they're going to thrive  
**[1:09:52-1:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:09:52):**  these are these are those telltale marks of the of the thriver wow yeah well that's that's really  
**[1:10:00-1:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:10:00):**  i'm glad that you also enjoyed that question uh the the on the spot list is is really helpful for  
**[1:10:06-1:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:10:06):**  me and i in the past two years i've been seeing elements of those pieces uh in in my operation  
**[1:10:13-1:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:10:13):**  uh we we got rid of our our hogs our pigs because the locals raise practically the same quality  
**[1:10:20-1:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:10:20):**  pork they're free range outside and i can buy them for cheaper than i can raise them  
**[1:10:26-1:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:10:26):**  and then and then divert the the pig scraps which from a couple of restaurants to cut it down on the  
**[1:10:32-1:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:10:32):**  cost of the hen feed um and yeah just little examples like that so so that was really  
**[1:10:38-1:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:10:38):**  enlightening to hear um absolutely so i know our time is getting close i have just one or two more  
**[1:10:45-1:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:10:45):**  quick things uh i was surprised in this book to read that polyface now cuts up their chicken  
**[1:10:52-1:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:10:52):**  and sells breast meat to the customers who are willing to pay the higher price  
**[1:10:57-1:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:10:57):**  the older books promoted you know the whole use the whole animal attitude uh and and i got the  
**[1:11:04-1:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:11:04):**  sense that cutting up chickens was maybe not only against that that ideal but also potentially not  
**[1:11:09-1:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:11:09):**  profitable given the time it takes and uh the potential lack of market for the off cuts of the  
**[1:11:15-1:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:11:15):**  bird um you actually inspired our farm to not cut up our chicken for those very same reasons  
**[1:11:21-1:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:11:21):**  but now you have me rethinking and i know breast is more sellable as well as just cooked chicken  
**[1:11:27-1:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:11:27):**  pulled off the bone so i was just curious why you made that change uh i know the customers are  
**[1:11:34-1:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:11:34):**  willing to pay for uh as for your book um but just curious um when when you see a market how do you  
**[1:11:43-1:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:11:43):**  how do you decide if it's worth a change is it just the profit or is there something about you  
**[1:11:48-1:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:11:48):**  know other things you factor into that decision yeah again such a such a great great question so  
**[1:11:56-1:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:11:56):**  for us that one of the things you have to do as a business is you have to appreciate that your  
**[1:12:04-1:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:12:04):**  context your context can change if you're gonna if you're gonna be in business for a good while  
**[1:12:10-1:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:12:10):**  um your context changes and so what we noticed i mean when shoot when we first started with chicken  
**[1:12:17-1:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:12:17):**  you couldn't go to the supermarket and get a boneless skinless breast everybody knew how to  
**[1:12:21-1:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:12:21):**  cut up a chicken i mean it was it was like in your dna right you were born knowing how to cut  
**[1:12:25-1:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:12:25):**  up a chicken and and and then what happened over the years we started hearing people well i'd you  
**[1:12:31-1:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:12:31):**  know i'd buy more chicken if if i could get it cut up or you know if i could get a boneless  
**[1:12:35-1:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:12:35):**  breast or you know i'm not gonna buy any because i only use boneless skinless breast so what we  
**[1:12:40-1:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:12:40):**  did was we started seeing our sales drop and and as a business you have to have your ear to the  
**[1:12:48-1:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:12:48):**  ground for your context it's okay to be nostalgic it's not okay to be so nostalgic that you become  
**[1:12:56-1:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:12:56):**  archaic i like so so so you you can you can become nostalgic to the point of obsolescence  
**[1:13:05-1:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:13:05):**  and that's not good for a business so we started seeing our sales drop as as the the as consumer  
**[1:13:13-1:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:13:13):**  ignorance increased and and and convene and the desire for for convenience only increased what we  
**[1:13:22-1:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:13:22):**  started seeing was it was it was it became harder and harder and harder to sell a chicken and so we  
**[1:13:28-1:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:13:28):**  felt like we said so finally you know after you hear this for the umpteenth time it finally hit  
**[1:13:34-1:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:13:34):**  you in the head and you say well goodness if if this is what if this is our new context if this  
**[1:13:39-1:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:13:39):**  is what it's going to take for us to stay in business the customer is not always right but  
**[1:13:45-1:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:13:45):**  they're right a lot of the time so we if we're going to keep them we better we better start  
**[1:13:49-1:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:13:49):**  listening and so the first year we did cut ups we sold twenty thousand dollars more chicken without  
**[1:13:56-1:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:13:56):**  raising another single chicken well yeah so that was a big deal all right so now just to show you  
**[1:14:04-1:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:14:04):**  that these things never change you know you can't you can never tie a knot in the string and say  
**[1:14:09-1:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:14:09):**  we're good for the duration no it's always changing so now one of the things we're dealing  
**[1:14:15-1:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:14:15):**  with now is you know we've run this wonderful you know uh metropolitan buying club delivery system  
**[1:14:21-1:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:14:21):**  uh it's worked wonderfully but what we're seeing now come in is all this pressure i mean incredible  
**[1:14:29-1:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:14:29):**  pressure from amazon walmart from every quarter uh from from in the industrial organic community  
**[1:14:36-1:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:14:36):**  to whatever for door-to-door delivery and we've not done door-to-door delivery we've done more  
**[1:14:44-1:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:14:44):**  you know a kind of it's not a csa but it you know it's order online and we deliver to a central  
**[1:14:49-1:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:14:49):**  central drop point everybody meets us there and picks it up and now we're starting to hear  
**[1:14:53-1:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:14:53):**  customers say well i you know i'd buy from you but i just don't want to get in my car and drive  
**[1:14:59-1:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:14:59):**  and and and sit through you know five stop lights to go over there to you know jane doe's house  
**[1:15:05-1:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:15:05):**  and and pick up can you come to my doorstep well you start hearing this stuff and and first it's  
**[1:15:11-1:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:15:11):**  a you know it's a oh yeah right you know but but then after you hear it the 10th time the  
**[1:15:19-1:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:15:19):**  20th time the 50th time you start realizing times are changing and so you you have to adapt you  
**[1:15:29-1:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:15:29):**  have to morph you know the one of the single biggest hot fad uh business slogans today is  
**[1:15:35-1:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:15:35):**  what got you here won't get you there i like that and and it's it's a it's an extremely powerful  
**[1:15:44-1:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:15:44):**  profound statement of context of course you know alan savory everything's about context right  
**[1:15:50-1:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:15:50):**  context but but but it is true it is true what what works in one spot won't work another spot  
**[1:15:56-1:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:15:56):**  and what worked 15 years ago and built a business does not work 15 years later and sustain a  
**[1:16:04-1:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:16:04):**  business and so so you have to you have to adjust you have to keep your ear to the ground listening  
**[1:16:11-1:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:16:11):**  to your to your customers so that you stay relevant within the context of your time  
**[1:16:18-1:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:16:18):**  absolutely i'm reminded of uh one of the permaculture principles which is uh to creatively  
**[1:16:25-1:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:16:25):**  use and respond to change and i just think polyface and yourself is a shining example  
**[1:16:32-1:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:16:32):**  i think a lot of people when they read one of your books have this idea of of of an idealist  
**[1:16:38-1:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:16:38):**  spirit maybe not willing to change but every time i read something new by you or now talk to you  
**[1:16:44-1:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:16:44):**  it's just clear that i think that flexibility to respond to change is probably the number one key  
**[1:16:49-1:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:16:49):**  to success or ongoing success maybe yeah yes yes um i i would i would agree yes great that that  
**[1:16:59-1:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:16:59):**  that doesn't mean that you don't have any conviction it doesn't mean that you throw all  
**[1:17:03-1:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:17:03):**  your values out the door what it does mean is that that as long as it's not you know immoral  
**[1:17:11-1:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:17:11):**  or unethical or anti-ecological or all those kinds of things a lot of things in life are malleable  
**[1:17:19-1:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:17:19):**  there a lot of them are valuable without you know going off to the dark side and we  
**[1:17:26-1:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:17:26):**  and we need to appreciate there are hills to die on but there are a lot of hills that aren't to die  
**[1:17:33-1:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:17:33):**  on and and we need to we need to have you know it takes a lot of discernment and wisdom to be able  
**[1:17:39-1:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:17:39):**  and wisdom to be able to maintain our you know our our our what we call our inner compass  
**[1:17:47-1:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:17:47):**  to maintain our inner compass within this this flexible context absolutely um so my my last  
**[1:17:55-1:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:17:55):**  quick thing uh kind of a throwback to the previous question where you made the list which i just want  
**[1:18:00-1:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:18:00):**  to repeat once more for everyone so some of the hallmarks of of transitioning around the five-year  
**[1:18:06-1:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:18:06):**  mark uh is partnership in whatever form that takes um the the efficiencies and then also the margins  
**[1:18:15-1:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:18:15):**  and financial analysis um and i just wanted to speak to the partnership once more and uh i've  
**[1:18:23-1:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:18:23):**  read your book fields of farmers but after reading the new book your successful farm business i feel  
**[1:18:28-1:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:18:28):**  compelled to go back and reread uh the fields of farmers because i think partnerships is probably  
**[1:18:36-1:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:18:36):**  the hardest thing at least for myself to entertain how how to bring on other people in a meaningful  
**[1:18:43-1:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:18:43):**  way that's harmonious for everyone involved uh and i also just want to quote your new book that  
**[1:18:50-1:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:18:50):**  says a farm is not successful until it's generating two salaries across two generations and i think  
**[1:18:58-1:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:18:58):**  they they can kind of fit together and uh i think you know i say we have a successful farm but we're  
**[1:19:04-1:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:19:04):**  definitely not anywhere near that and um it's a new challenge that i feel really excited about  
**[1:19:10-1:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:19:10):**  and i'd like if you could maybe speak on that a little more how how is it bringing on new partners  
**[1:19:16-1:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:19:16):**  and and thinking about generational sustainability well you certainly are correct uh the partnership  
**[1:19:25-1:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:19:25):**  the people the people aspect of this is far more difficult than than raising animals or plants  
**[1:19:33-1:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:19:33):**  yeah uh you know the goat the goats are always happy to see you you know they're they're not  
**[1:19:38-1:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:19:38):**  they're not moody you know the the cabbage plant um never says uh i don't want to see you today  
**[1:19:47-1:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:19:47):**  and so the people aspect is is absolutely the you know the biggest um issue here and and  
**[1:19:54-1:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:19:54):**  this is true in farming in other business at every place so um so the whole  
**[1:20:03-1:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:20:03):**  the the main thing i just want to point out here is that when we talk about our people we're not  
**[1:20:08-1:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:20:08):**  talking about a top-down corporate structure where where you know the the ceo gets a pile of money  
**[1:20:15-1:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:20:15):**  and the guy on the bottom end of the ladder gets almost nothing and and it's and and all the  
**[1:20:22-1:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:20:22):**  information and the instructions are flowing from the top down rather what we see this as a team of  
**[1:20:28-1:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:20:28):**  partners and so we don't structure it with with wage earners you know people punching the time  
**[1:20:33-1:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:20:33):**  clock wage earning what we're trying to do every one of these relationships we're trying to structure  
**[1:20:40-1:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:20:40):**  so that there's a shared risk shared risk and shared incentive so if if you do well i do well  
**[1:20:47-1:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:20:47):**  if i do well you do well and and if i suffer you suffer and if you suffer i suffer that that shared  
**[1:20:54-1:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:20:54):**  risk and incentive circle completely changes the relationship now now people um some people don't  
**[1:21:04-1:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:21:04):**  want any part of that because they want guarantees but you don't have to live very long in this life  
**[1:21:11-1:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:21:11):**  to know there's not a lot of guarantees yeah and and so and so part of adulthood part of adulthood  
**[1:21:18-1:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:21:18):**  is understanding there aren't very many guarantees and if there's going to be a way made i'm going to  
**[1:21:25-1:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:21:25):**  make it and uh you know be the change you want to be i mean there's a million ways to to describe  
**[1:21:31-1:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:21:31):**  this and so we find it very empowering um individually and and it it takes the tension  
**[1:21:41-1:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:21:41):**  out of the employer employee uh relationship and and all of these things when we share incentives  
**[1:21:51-1:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:21:51):**  and share risk so we structure the relationships by the piece by funk by performance by function  
**[1:21:59-1:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:21:59):**  so rather than having people who are raising chickens for so much an hour we say well you  
**[1:22:05-1:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:22:05):**  can raise chickens for so much so much a bird yeah and if if you let the foxes eat all the  
**[1:22:11-1:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:22:11):**  chickens then obviously you don't get paid and and people who love accountability are drawn to  
**[1:22:18-1:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:22:18):**  this people who don't like accountability are not drawn to it so it becomes a vetting a kind of a  
**[1:22:24-1:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:22:24):**  naturally vetting system to make sure that you have people of shared savvy shared well confidence  
**[1:22:33-1:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:22:33):**  affirmation savvy you know to go get it done it also means that when you're paying by by  
**[1:22:40-1:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:22:40):**  performance or function paying by function only it means that that um the the the boss  
**[1:22:51-1:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:22:51):**  does not have to compensate for um for all the negligence i mean for example if if our protocol  
**[1:23:00-1:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:23:00):**  is whenever you go check whenever you go move the cows you take a tote that has two spare insulators  
**[1:23:05-1:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:23:05):**  a pair of pliers a little piece of wire a piece of baler twine and and a water valve okay let's  
**[1:23:11-1:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:23:11):**  just say that that's the you know that's the protocol yeah yeah okay well if somebody if  
**[1:23:18-1:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:23:18):**  somebody neglects to take that tote and gets out there and needs a water valve and they have to  
**[1:23:24-1:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:23:24):**  ride the horse back walk back take the four-wheeler whatever it is and come back to the hub and get a  
**[1:23:30-1:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:23:30):**  and get a what i say a valve to go back out there and fix something that's their time yeah yeah  
**[1:23:37-1:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:23:37):**  really tense if they're on my clock but if they're if they're getting paid for moving the cows at a  
**[1:23:44-1:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:23:44):**  set rate and they neglect to do something and have a problem that costs them time they're not on my  
**[1:23:50-1:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:23:50):**  client time that completely takes the tension out of that whole relationship so so we so we have  
**[1:24:00-1:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:24:00):**  tried to structure everything here um so that so that all of the different functions and activities  
**[1:24:10-1:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:24:10):**  that are performed have kind of personal autonomy hooked to them and and we as whatever owners or  
**[1:24:20-1:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:24:20):**  you know the farm owners whatever we don't we don't have to absorb um all of the risk that's  
**[1:24:31-1:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:24:31):**  going on and man does that make us sleep better at night knowing we've got completely you know we've  
**[1:24:38-1:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:24:38):**  got stakeholders we've got stakeholders that are completely structured and incentivized to do the  
**[1:24:46-1:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:24:46):**  good things to do the right things and we don't have to sit here and bird dog and be and be mr you

**[1:26:27-1:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:26:27):**  before we wrap up this show for the week i've got some exciting news about the upcoming months  
**[1:26:31-1:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:26:31):**  and i'm joined here now with my good friend and founder of atitlan organics shad goodsy hey buddy  
**[1:26:36-1:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:26:36):**  what's new oh man so much is happening first off though i just want to say thanks for having me man  
**[1:26:43-1:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:26:43):**  i really love your podcast and i actually had a great time doing that interview back in one of  
**[1:26:47-1:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:26:47):**  the earlier episodes anyway probably what's most exciting is our new collaboration between atitlan  
**[1:26:53-1:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:26:53):**  organics and abundant edge as you know we've been offering permaculture design courses for over six  
**[1:26:59-1:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:26:59):**  years now and they really have become a staple here in lake atitlan in particular though the  
**[1:27:04-1:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:27:04):**  intro to permaculture course is just an amazing way for travelers gardeners architects basically  
**[1:27:10-1:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:27:10):**  anyone to fully immerse themselves in this new paradigm of permaculture design like honestly  
**[1:27:17-1:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:27:17):**  you can't take this course and still see the world the same way afterward yeah that's life changing  
**[1:27:23-1:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:27:23):**  but like i said what i'm most excited about is that now thanks to our collaboration we're going  
**[1:27:29-1:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:27:29):**  to be able to offer your natural building course immediately after every one of our intro to  
**[1:27:34-1:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:27:34):**  permaculture courses literally this two-week offering is like possibly the most complete package  
**[1:27:41-1:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:27:41):**  that i know of available anywhere basically with these two courses alone i think that someone should  
**[1:27:47-1:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:27:47):**  have everything they need to start their own regenerative project or just their own regenerative  
**[1:27:52-1:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:27:52):**  lifestyle that's that's what i'm excited about man but uh yeah what about you what's going on  
**[1:27:58-1:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:27:58):**  man well you know already that me and the abundant edge team are gearing up for a big season as well  
**[1:28:03-1:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:28:03):**  i mean starting in november we'll be breaking ground on a regenerative farming demonstration  
**[1:28:08-1:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:28:08):**  site which is of course right down the hill from your farm we'll be building animal pens a classroom  
**[1:28:14-1:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:28:14):**  outdoor kitchens and lounge areas connected to houses and it's all going to be made out of  
**[1:28:19-1:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:28:19):**  natural materials i mean the site is going to serve as a demonstration farm for perennial and regenerative  
**[1:28:25-1:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:28:25):**  farming methods for years and years to come and we'll even be offering courses and internship  
**[1:28:30-1:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:28:30):**  opportunities to people who want to learn for themselves about how to build with natural  
**[1:28:34-1:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:28:34):**  materials and set up their own farms heck yeah that sounds amazing man and honestly this is just  
**[1:28:40-1:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:28:40):**  about the best place in the world to learn all these things too i mean this little town is sunu  
**[1:28:45-1:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:28:45):**  na in the gorgeous tropical mountains of guatemala like right here on the shores of lake atitlan it's  
**[1:28:51-1:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:28:51):**  one of the most beautiful places in the world and on top of that you have this traditional indigenous  
**[1:28:56-1:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:28:56):**  mayan culture that's still rich and alive and probably my favorite part is that we have this  
**[1:29:01-1:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:29:01):**  world international community of alternative people that are open to new ideas and really  
**[1:29:07-1:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:29:07):**  putting things into practice i mean within walking distance of the bamboo guest house you've got

**[1:29:34-1:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:29:34):**  people as possible in on these projects but we've got to make sure that they've got the skills first  
**[1:29:39-1:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-joel-salatin/#t=1:29:39):**  so what do you say let's offer a big discount to those who sign up for both courses i mean all food

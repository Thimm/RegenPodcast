**[0:07:51-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:07:51):**  in the movement that more people should check out.

**[0:08:06-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:08:06):**  at 25 years old and so just started planting and growing food and you know burning wood  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:08:13):**  and trying to have my resources come as much from on site as possible.

**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:14:34):**  You know, what grows there and then what used to grow there as far as you can figure out  
**[0:14:39-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:14:39):**  talking to people, older local folks to find out what the natural communities looked like

**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:14:54):**  So what grows in similar climates on a different continent?  
**[0:14:58-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:14:58):**  You know, for us that's what grows on the leeward side of cold climate continents.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:15:06):**  You know, like what grows in South Korea, what grows in Northern Japan, what grows in

**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:15:32):**  So those are big ones, you know, just kind of the ecological communities research both  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:15:36):**  locally and abroad that might apply.

**[0:15:46-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:15:46):**  in that process.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:15:47):**  I mean, natives are just what happened to have emerged or been dispersed to this area  
**[0:15:53-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:15:53):**  over time.

**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:16:19):**  I don't think the distinction between native and non-native is actually very useful and

**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:19:20):**  How does that play into the larger concept of resilience?  
**[0:19:23-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:19:23):**  Well, it's kind of in a simple way thinking in terms of lots of eggs in a basket rather  
**[0:19:30-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:19:30):**  than lots of eggs in lots of baskets versus all your eggs in one basket to put it in terms  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:19:37):**  that is common kind of adage that people know of.

**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:22:31):**  By connectivity, I think that the more linkages between elements in the system is how I would  
**[0:22:36-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:22:36):**  think of it.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:22:37):**  And that gets it kind of a lot of definitions of healthy ecosystem that ecologists have  
**[0:22:45-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:22:45):**  used.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:22:46):**  It's not just overall number of species.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:22:48):**  It's, you know, how and how many different ways are the species in the system connected.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:22:55):**  So yeah, I think that's really key.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:23:00):**  You know, thinking in terms of infrastructure systems, for instance, is a very easy way  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:23:04):**  to think of connectivity because it's very simple compared to biological systems.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:23:10):**  So let's see, like I have a well pump and I can supply that well pump from the grid  
**[0:23:17-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:23:17):**  or a battery which is charged by solar panels or a generator.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:23:24):**  So there's two, well, there's three different ways that that well pump can connect to what  
**[0:23:30-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:23:30):**  it needs to actually work.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:23:31):**  No, that's a perfect example.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:23:33):**  The elements it can connect to.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:23:35):**  There's actually not three different ways.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:23:36):**  There's only the wires going down to the well pump and that is a very vulnerable, since  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:23:43):**  that is the only way that is actually exceptionally vulnerable, luckily it's a very durable element  
**[0:23:49-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:23:49):**  because there's not really much to cause those wires to fail.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:23:53):**  But it's a vulnerable point because it is only one.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:23:56):**  You can kind of map these things out and say, okay, well here's only one conduit that it  
**[0:24:00-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:24:00):**  all flows through.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:24:01):**  So that's one link in the system.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:24:03):**  Sure, and that could be an opportunity to build redundancy or diversity of ways that  
**[0:24:09-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:24:09):**  that same function could be addressed.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:24:11):**  Of course, using a simplified system like a water pump, but this applies much more into  
**[0:24:16-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:24:16):**  the complexity of an ecological setting as well.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:24:19):**  Yeah, and then you can kind of look at higher orders of backing things up too.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:24:24):**  Like I have friends and a lot of people who are always thinking somewhat simplistically  
**[0:24:31-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:24:31):**  of providing needs.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:24:32):**  So like I have a friend who says, well, how much gas or propane are you storing to run  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:24:41):**  your generator, especially in light of this whole pandemic thing, if you're thinking about  
**[0:24:45-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:24:45):**  being able to provide your own needs to keep your freezer cool, for instance.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:24:49):**  It's like, well, not all that much, but the larger focus is to not need electricity to  
**[0:24:54-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:24:54):**  begin with.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:24:56):**  But it's very easy to get locked into, well, I need electricity, so then I need all of  
**[0:25:01-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:25:01):**  these resources in place to always be making that electricity.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:25:04):**  Of course, you're a much more liberated situation to not need the electricity to begin with.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:25:09):**  So putting energy into reducing the need for electricity to begin with is going to get  
**[0:25:15-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:25:15):**  you very far a lot of times.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:25:17):**  Yeah, no, that's another good example.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:25:20):**  And then so you wrap this up with manageability that kind of brings it all together.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:25:24):**  And the way I understand it is that this puts a little bit of a constraint on what it is  
**[0:25:29-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:25:29):**  you can try and attempt, because if it supersedes manageability, it's getting out of your hands  
**[0:25:35-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:25:35):**  and it's not within your control any longer.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:25:38):**  How would you explain that one?  
**[0:25:39-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:25:39):**  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:25:40):**  I mean, you can set up all these brilliant systems that work perfectly.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:25:45):**  Think about when you go to a lot of sites, permaculture sites, let's say, or places where  
**[0:25:50-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:25:50):**  people are really creative and they have a lot of energy and time and they've got these  
**[0:25:52-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:25:52):**  amazing intricate things happening.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:25:55):**  But after a while, you realize, okay, is that going to be happening in five years?  
**[0:25:58-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:25:58):**  You're going to be able to keep up with that.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:26:00):**  And personally, I did a lot of that.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:26:02):**  I did all sorts of cool things that then couldn't keep up with.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:26:06):**  For instance, the Jean Pain mound was a sweet little compost-heated mound.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:26:10):**  But to keep the pipes from freezing and to keep the pile heated was actually kind of  
**[0:26:15-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:26:15):**  a lot of things to do and remember and keep up with.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:26:19):**  And if any of that stops, the system's not working.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:26:23):**  So that's a good example of when it works, if you can keep up with it, it's awesome.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:26:27):**  But the manageability is the limiting factor to all this.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:26:31):**  And with enough time and energy and money, you can make pretty much anything work and  
**[0:26:35-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:26:35):**  all sorts of amazing stuff look like it's happening on site.

**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:26:43):**  away for a week or you just sleep in and it was really cold so that thing froze and then  
**[0:26:49-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:26:49):**  everything locked up until May when things melted, whatever.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:26:55):**  That's why I'm most interested in ultimately the simplest systems that survive.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:27:02):**  And definitely manageability is for sure the limiting factor to all of it.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:27:05):**  It's not really design, the ideas of what to do, and it's not even in a lot of places  
**[0:27:12-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:27:12):**  physical or energetic resources.

**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:27:32):**  it's going to change for sure and maybe it's changing quickly now as we speak.

**[0:49:31-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:49:31):**  We know people who decided to start Elderberry Farm and they're on super well-drained gravelly

**[0:49:48-0:49:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:49:48):**  You should probably choose a place first, then make a business plan to fit the place.

**[0:50:08-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-build-resilience-in-your-life-in-a-rapidly-changing-world-with-ben-falk-of-whole-systems-design/#t=0:50:08):**  Most of the time, a lot of times people get it backwards and they have their well-crafted

### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 21 May 2021 06:08:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:00:00):**  This is Regenerative Skills, the podcast helping you to learn the skills and solutions  
**[0:00:05-0:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:00:05):**  to create an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:00:08):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gautier.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:00:12):**  Welcome back everybody to the fourth of the monthly expert panel discussions.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:00:16):**  Now, as I mentioned in the past, each month I'll be hosting discussions and debates between  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:00:20):**  some of the most prominent voices in regenerative agriculture, soil science, restoration land  
**[0:00:25-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:00:25):**  management, and more.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:00:27):**  So if you're a subscribing member on Patreon, you'll also be invited to the live events  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:00:30):**  and the open Q&A for listeners after this panel.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:00:34):**  Now in this session, I hosted a discussion on regenerating agricultural soil with my  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:00:39):**  friends and colleagues at Climate Farmers, which is a non-profit organization working  
**[0:00:43-0:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:00:43):**  to advance regenerative agriculture in Europe.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:00:45):**  Now in this panel, I got two of my favorite educators on the subject of soil science together  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:00:50):**  to talk about how to build fertility and holistic health in agricultural soils.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:00:55):**  Now since these discussions are longer than the regular weekly episodes, I'll keep the  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:00:59):**  introduction short and jump right into the introductions for our two panelists.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:01:04):**  First off, we've got Dr. Elaine Ingham.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:01:06):**  Now Dr. Ingham discovered the soil food web nearly four decades ago and has been pioneering  
**[0:01:11-0:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:01:11):**  research ever since.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:01:13):**  She's widely considered the world's foremost soil biologist and is passionate about empowering  
**[0:01:18-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:01:18):**  ordinary people to bring soils in their community back to life.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:01:21):**  Now Dr. Elaine's soil food web approach has been used to successfully restore the ecological  
**[0:01:26-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:01:26):**  function of soils on six continents.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:01:29):**  She's helped to make soil health knowledge available to people with no relevant experience,  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:01:35):**  making it accessible to individuals who wish to retrain and to begin a meaningful and impactful  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:01:39):**  career in an area that will help to secure the survival of humans and other species.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:01:44):**  Now our second panelist is John Kempf, who has taken on the bold mission of having regenerative  
**[0:01:50-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:01:50):**  models of agricultural management become the mainstream globally by the year 2040.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:01:56):**  In addition to being a former grower himself, John is the founder of Advancing Eco-Agriculture,  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:02:01):**  Crop Health Labs, Ozadiah, and the Regenerative Agriculture Academy.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:02:06):**  He also hosts the Regenerative Agriculture Podcast, where he interviews top growers and  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:02:10):**  scientists about the principles and practice of implementing regenerative agriculture on  
**[0:02:15-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:02:15):**  a large scale.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:02:16):**  So let's jump right in.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:02:18):**  So thank you both for being here.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:02:20):**  It's a great opportunity to speak to you again.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:02:23):**  And to start us off, I would like to pose the question, what is the potential that both  
**[0:02:29-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:02:29):**  of you see if we're able to reverse the trends of soil degradation through all forms of cultivation  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:02:36):**  and stewardship?  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:02:37):**  What would be the impact on the food system, the farming lifestyles, the climates, and  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:02:42):**  our waterways if we're able to achieve this goal of repairing soils around the world?  
**[0:02:47-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:02:47):**  Starting with Elaine.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:02:48):**  Well, the answer to the question is kind of how far out do you want to go?  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:02:54):**  Because what's the timeline?  
**[0:02:58-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:02:58):**  Because realistically, if we start adopting the kinds of things that John and I both talk  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:03:05):**  about, we're going to live in Eden.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:03:09):**  It's back to the garden.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:03:11):**  You walk outside and you take the fruit off the trees.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:03:15):**  You have your garden.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:03:17):**  It's right there.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:03:18):**  And it's got all the plants have maximum nutrition that they possibly can hold because every  
**[0:03:26-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:03:26):**  second of every day with good healthy food web in your soil functioning for that plant,  
**[0:03:34-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:03:34):**  that plant is going to get every single nutrient properly balanced for that plant.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:03:41):**  Because you have the biology in the soil up and running the way it's supposed to.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:03:45):**  You balance the fungal to bacterial ratio.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:03:48):**  You've got the right amount of predators.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:03:50):**  And so that plant's getting all the nutrients it needs.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:03:53):**  It's protected above and below ground by all these microorganisms on those surfaces.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:03:59):**  The pests and diseases, the parasites don't even know the plant's there because it's so  
**[0:04:05-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:04:05):**  well protected.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:04:07):**  The roots go down as deep as they can and structure has been formed in the soil.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:04:11):**  There aren't any compaction layers.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:04:14):**  The plant can get to that summer water stored by snow melt or by rainfall in the springtime.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:04:22):**  Us as human beings don't really have to do anything more than plant the seed.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:04:28):**  What do you want to put in here this summer?  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:04:30):**  What do you want to actually grow?  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:04:32):**  And so the plants, the seeds, the starts go into the soil.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:04:36):**  And other than that, once you have that biology back in the soil and it's working full time  
**[0:04:41-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:04:41):**  and you're feeding it by having understory plants present in the system, you can go fishing  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:04:48):**  for the rest of the summer or whatever you care to do.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:04:53):**  Hiking in the mountains.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:04:55):**  You do have to come back every once in a while and check and make sure that there's no little  
**[0:04:58-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:04:58):**  surprises starting to happen.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:05:01):**  But it's almost from my point of view, that's a perfect lifestyle.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:05:06):**  You don't have to get involved in stressful, nasty human interactions where we're fighting  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:05:13):**  over something that we shouldn't fight over in the first place.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:05:18):**  Abundance is easy to come by if you start understanding what you're doing with that  
**[0:05:24-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:05:24):**  biology, with the plants, with the animals.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:05:27):**  And yep, it's in systems that have to be understood completely so you can tell when something's  
**[0:05:34-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:05:34):**  wrong.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:05:35):**  You have to have that microscope to be able to tell you when something is starting to  
**[0:05:40-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:05:40):**  go wrong.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:05:41):**  By the time you've got dead and dying plants, you messed up.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:05:46):**  You didn't pay attention to what mother nature was trying to tell you.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:05:50):**  And so she's going to visit death and destruction upon your garden.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:05:56):**  So we need to learn all those signals.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:05:58):**  We need to learn how to read that book of mother nature.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:06:03):**  So I've probably gone on and on for way too long.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:06:05):**  So I'll stop here.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:06:06):**  No, that's okay.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:06:07):**  That's a wonderful vision.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:06:09):**  John, can you tell us what you see as a vision for healthy soils around the world, especially  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:06:15):**  in the agricultural context where you're used to working?  
**[0:06:18-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:06:18):**  I'd like to expand the conversation beyond just healthy soils.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:06:21):**  I think Elaine mentioned this and described it very well.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:06:24):**  But rather than focusing exclusively on a conversation about a healthy soil food web,  
**[0:06:31-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:06:31):**  the ultimate expression of a healthy soil food web is a healthy life web.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:06:37):**  And Elaine, you described this very well.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:06:40):**  We need to also look at and consider the health of the plants that are growing on that landscape,  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:06:46):**  the health of the livestock and the people that are consuming those plants.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:06:50):**  So to summarize it as succinctly as I can, I would say that nutritional integrity and  
**[0:06:59-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:06:59):**  microbiome integrity is at the foundation of health for the entire living ecosystem.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:07:06):**  And those are the things that we need to manage as farmers, as farm managers, as producers,  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:07:12):**  whatever our role is in the larger ecosystem.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:07:16):**  And when you consider those two aspects and the future that can be brought about, I look  
**[0:07:23-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:07:23):**  at it from a very practical perspective.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:07:28):**  Is our agronomic management, our management of that microbiome and our management of the  
**[0:07:33-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:07:33):**  nutritional integrity, is that bringing about resistance to parasites and livestock and  
**[0:07:40-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:07:40):**  people?  
**[0:07:41-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:07:41):**  Is it bringing about disease resistance?  
**[0:07:42-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:07:42):**  Is it bringing about insect resistance?  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:07:43):**  If the answers are yes, then those are from a very practical foundational perspective.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:07:49):**  Those are the outcomes that we seek and the outcomes that are possible.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:07:52):**  And if that is not happening, we need to change our management systems.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:07:56):**  Well said.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:07:58):**  And with that positive idea moving forward about what it is that we can achieve, there  
**[0:08:03-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:08:03):**  are some things, especially with how popular soil science and awareness around building  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:08:09):**  biology in the soil has been in the last handful of years, there's also been a lot of myths  
**[0:08:14-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:08:14):**  and misconceptions or misunderstandings about how to achieve this.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:08:18):**  John, can you speak to some of those that you've seen perhaps in popular culture and  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:08:22):**  social media that are misleading or not really helping to advance a clear understanding about  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:08:28):**  how to build healthy and biologically rich soils?  
**[0:08:32-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:08:32):**  That's a very big, broad, open-ended question, Oliver, because there are so many misconceptions  
**[0:08:44-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:08:44):**  that it's hard to know where to begin.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:08:47):**  So I'll point out one that I've spoken to frequently, which is the idea that it takes  
**[0:08:53-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:08:53):**  healthy soil to grow healthy plants.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:08:55):**  And that isn't necessarily incorrect, but it most certainly is incomplete because we  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:09:01):**  need to ask the follow-up question of what is it that creates healthy soils?  
**[0:09:06-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:09:06):**  And what creates healthy soils is the contribution of plants.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:09:09):**  It is plants that contribute carbon.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:09:11):**  It's plants that contribute root exudates.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:09:13):**  And thus, it is plants that provide the food source for biology to thrive.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:09:18):**  So I've made the comment in the past that without the contribution of plants, soil is  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:09:25):**  little more than decomposed rock particles because there is nothing there for the biology  
**[0:09:30-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:09:30):**  to feed on.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:09:31):**  And so when we ask the question, if the idea is that it takes healthy soil to grow healthy  
**[0:09:36-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:09:36):**  plants, the next step, the immediate, obvious next question should be, what does it take  
**[0:09:42-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:09:42):**  to grow really healthy soils or to produce really healthy soils?  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:09:45):**  And the answer to that question, in my opinion, is it takes really healthy plants and large  
**[0:09:49-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:09:49):**  populations of photosynthesizing plants to feed that soil biology.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:09:53):**  So I think that's one piece we need to consider.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:09:56):**  And then something else we need to consider is that, as Elaine has so eloquently described  
**[0:10:01-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:10:01):**  in her work, microbial populations have an incredible capacity to release nutrients from  
**[0:10:09-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:10:09):**  the existing soil mineral matrix and make them available to crops.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:10:12):**  And that is where plants and crops should be getting their nutrition.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:10:16):**  And we also need to consider the geological context.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:10:20):**  If we are working with soils that are based on a foundational bedrock that is completely  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:10:24):**  absent some critical nutrients, we need to consider where those plants are going to source  
**[0:10:28-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:10:28):**  those nutrients from.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:10:29):**  So those are a few that come to mind.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:10:32):**  And I'll just add one last thought, which is that what we observe on large scale production  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:10:39):**  agriculture is that most nutritional imbalances are not a result of what is absent in the  
**[0:10:45-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:10:45):**  soil.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:10:46):**  They are a result of the excessive fertilizers that farmers apply that create deficiencies  
**[0:10:51-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:10:51):**  of other elements.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:10:52):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:10:53):**  I see some nodding in agreement and some questioning looks from Elaine's side.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:10:58):**  Can you give a rebuttal of what you just heard and maybe add some of the myths and misconceptions  
**[0:11:02-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:11:02):**  that you see out there?  
**[0:11:04-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:11:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:11:06):**  When we get into specifics, there's a lot of misconceptions, but I don't think we're  
**[0:11:10-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:11:10):**  really going to be talking at that scale today.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:11:13):**  We're making compost and the things that people mess up on.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:11:19):**  But when we're talking about healthy soil and healthy plants, it's a little bit kind  
**[0:11:27-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:11:27):**  of just dealing with grammar, maybe a little bit.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:11:30):**  But I want to take us back to the whole process of succession.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:11:35):**  When an ecosystem has been destroyed because of fire, extreme fire or extreme flooding,  
**[0:11:44-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:11:44):**  the whole mountainside came down on you and now there's just highly disturbed dirt.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:11:51):**  Most of the biology is gone.  
**[0:11:53-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:11:53):**  The first thing that comes back into that material, and it's really I'm going to call  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:12:00):**  it dirt because that's what it is, you don't have the food web in it because of the disturbance  
**[0:12:06-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:12:06):**  factor.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:12:08):**  And yet the first thing that comes back into that system is not a plant.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:12:13):**  It's going to be microorganisms that are photosynthetic.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:12:16):**  And so they provide that first step into harnessing carbon, the energy of the sunlight, binding  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:12:25):**  those two carbon atoms together, then the third atom and then the fourth atom of carbon  
**[0:12:30-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:12:30):**  fifth and starting to build sugars.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:12:33):**  So we start off right at the soil level of we do need to understand how you get through  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:12:40):**  that highly disturbed dirt stage of life.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:12:45):**  And it's going to be the microorganisms that are doing that work.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:12:50):**  Of course, as soon as you've got bacteria growing, now you're having some decomposition  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:12:55):**  occurring and along come the predators, you're going to be seeing the protozoa coming into  
**[0:13:00-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:13:00):**  the system pretty rapidly to eat those bacteria and start setting up nutrient cycling.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:13:07):**  It's not until you have enough of that nutrient cycling process occurring that rooted plants  
**[0:13:16-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:13:16):**  can come into that system.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:13:18):**  So it gets to be kind of a chicken and an egg question.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:13:21):**  What comes first, plants or the microorganisms that they feed and then the microorganisms  
**[0:13:26-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:13:26):**  feed the plants back the nutrients they require and what is it that really causes that successional  
**[0:13:33-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:13:33):**  process to shift?  
**[0:13:35-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:13:35):**  How do you get from just algae and lichens and moss growing on the surface of your dirt?  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:13:43):**  What is it that allows those first weeds to start growing in your system?  
**[0:13:48-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:13:48):**  So you've got to accumulate enough bacteria, enough protozoa, enough bacterial feeding  
**[0:13:55-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:13:55):**  nematodes to start that process of nutrient cycling or plants aren't possible.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:14:01):**  So now you have very weedy systems.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:14:03):**  That's not what we want for agriculture.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:14:06):**  We have to start getting the fungi back into the system so that you can have the NH4 in  
**[0:14:15-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:14:15):**  the soil, the ammonia must be present at certain levels depending on what weeds you want to  
**[0:14:22-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:14:22):**  grow or what crop plants you want to grow.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:14:25):**  There's been a series of papers out of a number of universities in Japan where I went  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:14:31):**  and talked with them many years ago at this point.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:14:35):**  But I think I kind of started them down this pathway of saying, okay, what's the balance  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:14:40):**  of nitrate and ammonium?  
**[0:14:43-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:14:43):**  What effect does that have on plant production?  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:14:46):**  When nitrate is very high, that means you're going to be growing weeds and just weeds.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:14:51):**  If you have your crop plants in the system, ouch, it's going to be unpleasant until you  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:14:57):**  can finally get ammonium starting to come into that system.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:15:02):**  And it's when that ammonium and that nitrate kind of shift in space.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:15:09):**  Now you can have highly productive shrubs and deciduous forests and eventually conifers.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:15:17):**  So that whole successional process, you've got to get fungi started.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:15:21):**  Well what starts the fungi growing in these systems?  
**[0:15:24-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:15:24):**  They've got to have food.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:15:26):**  And so what provides that is indeed the plants.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:15:29):**  Just as John said, if you understand this whole successional system in its entirety,  
**[0:15:38-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:15:38):**  what really starts everything is the biology and the soil.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:15:42):**  And then the plants can come in.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:15:43):**  And because those plants make cellulose, now we've got some fungal foods.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:15:48):**  Now the fungi can start growing.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:15:50):**  Now your plants can start making lignin because you've got the fungi there.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:15:55):**  And now the lignin is food to feed better, different kinds of species, better from my  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:16:02):**  point of view, because I like forests more than I like grasslands.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:16:07):**  What's more beautiful?  
**[0:16:08-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:16:08):**  Okay, I'm a child of the environment I grew up in.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:16:11):**  Minnesota, all those lakes and forests.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:16:17):**  The most peaceful place I can imagine is sitting in the middle of a Minnesota mixed pine and  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:16:25):**  deciduous forest and listening to the birds and the frogs and everything.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:16:30):**  That's my piece.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:16:32):**  That's where I go to meditate.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:16:36):**  So nutrient cycling, all of that depends on a synergy.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:16:41):**  It's an interaction with both plants and microorganisms.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:16:45):**  So maybe we don't need to have that competition.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:16:49):**  We don't need to invoke that one's better than the other.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:16:55):**  We're not going to have Eden if we don't put it all back together.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:17:00):**  Well, thank you for not only explaining that, but also bringing me back to my childhood  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:17:07):**  because I grew up in Minnesota as well with that idea in the background and the 15,000  
**[0:17:13-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:17:13):**  lakes around that takes me back to.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:17:15):**  Now, John, in order to get a better understanding of your soil, you have to do some kind of  
**[0:17:23-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:17:23):**  analysis and some tests.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:17:25):**  And I know you work with growers all around the United States, and I'm sure I've consulted  
**[0:17:29-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:17:29):**  in many other places too about the best way to assess the state of health or degradation  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:17:35):**  that your soil is in.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:17:37):**  And a lot of people are asking whether it's really worth getting professional lab tests  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:17:40):**  or if there's a lot of analysis that you can do on the site without having to go to higher  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:17:45):**  tech methods to learn a lot about what's happening underneath the ground.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:17:49):**  What advice would you give on that front?  
**[0:17:54-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:17:54):**  It depends on how dedicated you are and the outcomes that you desire and how rapidly you  
**[0:17:58-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:17:58):**  desire them, I suppose.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:18:00):**  So I actually gave an hour-long in-depth webinar on how our perspective on this has evolved  
**[0:18:07-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:18:07):**  over the last 15 years.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:18:08):**  That posted on YouTube just this last week, I think.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:18:10):**  I'm not even sure what the clip is called.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:18:13):**  But I believe that ultimately plants are the final report card.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:18:18):**  If we talk about disease and insect resistance, plants are the ultimate indicator of what  
**[0:18:24-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:18:24):**  is actually truly going on in the soil, and they are much more accurate than a laboratory  
**[0:18:27-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:18:27):**  analysis.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:18:28):**  And so in our work, in our professional work, we have worked with SAP analysis very closely  
**[0:18:34-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:18:34):**  to evaluate how the plants are absorbing nutrients from the soil profile.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:18:40):**  And that, of course, gives us indications into the soils, microbial activity, organic  
**[0:18:44-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:18:44):**  matter levels, and so forth.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:18:47):**  And so where we are at this moment, after collecting lots of data for the last decade  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:18:54):**  and a half, is that we use SAP analysis during the growing season to monitor the crops' nutrient  
**[0:18:59-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:18:59):**  absorption and performance.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:19:01):**  And we still use the typical CEC soil analysis, just because they are what many farmers are  
**[0:19:09-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:19:09):**  familiar with.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:19:10):**  But we have a growing distrust for them, because we find that those nutrient analysis do not  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:19:17):**  correlate with actual measured plant nutrient absorption, with the exception of a very few  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:19:21):**  nutrients.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:19:22):**  And so our work today, we usually pull, in terms of a nutrient assay, we pull a single  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:19:31):**  geological analysis, like a mining analysis, mining extraction for each given soil type,  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:19:37):**  that can tell us the total nutrient profile of what is in that soil.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:19:41):**  And you only need to do that one time.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:19:42):**  And that gives you an indication of the nutrient reserves that biology can access and can tap  
**[0:19:48-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:19:48):**  into, can make available to crops.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:19:49):**  And it's important to know this, because some soil types, based on the geological bedrock  
**[0:19:55-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:19:55):**  foundational parent material, may not have certain nutrients that crops need.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:20:01):**  And the majority may be there in abundance.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:20:05):**  So this is very valuable to actually see what the foundational parent material is that you  
**[0:20:09-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:20:09):**  have to work with.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:20:10):**  And then we also, we do still continue to pull CEC analysis, largely just from a psychological  
**[0:20:16-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:20:16):**  grower comfort perspective, more than from an agronomic use perspective almost.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:20:20):**  We still, we use them primarily for calcium, magnesium balance, and perhaps a few other  
**[0:20:24-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:20:24):**  things, but we're using them very minimally anymore.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:20:27):**  And then we're also using, just started in the last two years, why they're using the  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:20:31):**  Haney analysis, because that seems to correlate much more accurately with actual measured  
**[0:20:35-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:20:35):**  plant nutrient absorption.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:20:36):**  And it seems to connect with the biological capacity to deliver nutrients.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:20:43):**  And within the last year and going forward in this current growing season, we're anxious  
**[0:20:47-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:20:47):**  to do a lot more work with measuring biological profiles, because that has been a perceived  
**[0:20:56-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:20:56):**  weakness that we have observed in our own systems that we haven't yet been comfortable  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:21:01):**  with many of the microbial bioassays for repeatability and reliability.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:21:07):**  Obviously, your great work Elaine with microscope and microscopic analysis is foundational.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:21:12):**  But it's also user dependent and many farmers don't have the bandwidth or the desire to  
**[0:21:17-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:21:17):**  engage with that.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:21:19):**  So that's something that we are actively evaluating and working on including more and that's kind  
**[0:21:23-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:21:23):**  of where we are at the moment.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:21:25):**  Dr. Elaine, can you talk about some of the most important things that people should be  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:21:31):**  trying to evaluate in their soils in the best way or perhaps even most economical way for  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:21:36):**  growers to do that?  
**[0:21:39-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:21:39):**  We like to avoid the chemistry tests because they don't, just as John was saying, they  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:21:47):**  don't really tell you about the potential pool of nutrients.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:21:52):**  They'll tell you what the, and typically the chemistry tests that you get from a chemistry  
**[0:21:58-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:21:58):**  lab is only going to be telling you about the soluble inorganic pool of nutrients.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:22:04):**  Maybe if you do a little work on calcium magnesium ratios, you're going to get a little bit about  
**[0:22:12-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:22:12):**  cation exchange capacity.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:22:14):**  But it doesn't tell you what the biology is going to be able to convert from plant not  
**[0:22:21-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:22:21):**  available into plant available.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:22:24):**  Knowing the organisms and the biomass of the bacteria and fungi are going to tell you a  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:22:31):**  lot about that nutrient cycling process, the potential.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:22:35):**  If you then also add the protozoa, the nematodes, the microarthropods into that biological assessment  
**[0:22:43-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:22:43):**  of your soil, you'll get to understand the rate at which those nutrients are going to  
**[0:22:49-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:22:49):**  be made available.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:22:51):**  And of course, it's all of the organisms together that allow you to understand the balance,  
**[0:22:58-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:22:58):**  that you're getting the balance of all of the nutrients, not just nitrogen or phosphorus  
**[0:23:02-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:23:02):**  or sulfur or magnesium, but everything.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:23:05):**  And your plant requires all of those nutrients.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:23:08):**  Quite often, a plant is actually going to be restricted from being able to grow because  
**[0:23:14-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:23:14):**  of some minor or we call them micronutrients.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:23:20):**  Still means that you've got to have that micronutrient present in adequate amounts.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:23:26):**  And most of the time when I look at parent material and try to understand what are the  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:23:32):**  nutrients that are going to be made available or can be made available, we're going to be  
**[0:23:37-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:23:37):**  able to assess that because it's the biology that is causing that shift into plant available.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:23:47):**  And in fact, I don't know of any parent material that lacks any of the nutrients that your  
**[0:23:55-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:23:55):**  plant requires.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:23:56):**  There's some strange marine sands that have been sitting at the bottom of the ocean for  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:24:01):**  the last 10 billion years, well, maybe not that long, but for a very long time.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:24:07):**  And by the time they're scraped up against the shoreline and they form dunes, that's  
**[0:24:15-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:24:15):**  not soil.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:24:17):**  That's dirt, that's sand, there's serious lacks in some of those things.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:24:22):**  They've got to get mixed into the parent material that the bacterium fungi are breaking down  
**[0:24:28-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:24:28):**  on a daily basis.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:24:30):**  There's a huge amount of nutrient being released from rocks and pebbles and sand, silt and  
**[0:24:36-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:24:36):**  clay and parent material boulders, all of that.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:24:40):**  So nutrients aren't lacking in your soil.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:24:45):**  You may be lacking the microorganisms to convert them into an available plant available form.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:24:50):**  And so that's what you need to know.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:24:52):**  So we encourage people to use a microscope.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:24:57):**  And especially for people who are not professionals.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:25:01):**  The idea is that we want you to take one teaspoon of your soil and mix in four teaspoons of  
**[0:25:08-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:25:08):**  water, shake it for 30 seconds, a drop goes on the microscope slide, you look at it, you  
**[0:25:15-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:25:15):**  don't have to quantify everything.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:25:18):**  So you want to get a good idea of the number of bacteria.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:25:26):**  And in that sample, what's the diversity of bacteria?  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:25:30):**  You've seen lots of different sizes and shapes, then you've got good diversity.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:25:34):**  Take a look at 10, 20, 30 of the fields of view on that microscope slide that you've  
**[0:25:42-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:25:42):**  put together.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:25:44):**  And how variable are those bacterial numbers?  
**[0:25:49-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:25:49):**  Well be looking for fungi too.  
**[0:25:51-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:25:51):**  So we give you, we teach people how to measure what is, identify what are fungal hyphae,  
**[0:26:01-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:26:01):**  what are the good guy fungal hyphae, what are the bad guy fungal hyphae.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:26:05):**  And they're fairly distinguishable.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:26:08):**  Things that fall into that oh my seed category, which people are arguing, taxonomists are arguing  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:26:14):**  right now whether those are actually fungi at all.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:26:18):**  But I don't really care about that because I know it's the oh my seeds that cause a great  
**[0:26:25-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:26:25):**  deal of the diseases.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:26:27):**  And that's what we need to be able to identify.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:26:30):**  If the only thing you're seeing in your soil is oh my seed, you should be worried right  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:26:35):**  now and you should do the things necessary to bring back in the biology that will take  
**[0:26:40-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:26:40):**  out those bad guys.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:26:43):**  Well what if you've got the not desirable protozoa?  
**[0:26:48-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:26:48):**  You want to have just the good guy protozoa.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:26:50):**  How do you get the protozoa back into your soil?  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:26:53):**  You've got to be making compost.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:26:56):**  There's your inoculum of all the organisms that you need.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:27:00):**  So long before the plants start showing that there's something wrong down there in the  
**[0:27:06-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:27:06):**  soil and their roots have been massively attacked enough to start showing you above ground that  
**[0:27:14-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:27:14):**  there are problems.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:27:16):**  We want to be looking at the soil and fixing those problems before any problems ever start  
**[0:27:23-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:27:23):**  to occur.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:27:25):**  So that's chemical assessment of the soil.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:27:30):**  It's not telling you what you need to know soon enough.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:27:34):**  So if you can learn to just use the simple microscopy, have you seen any protozoa, any  
**[0:27:40-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:27:40):**  of the good guys in your soil as you're looking through your soil sample on the microscope?  
**[0:27:45-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:27:45):**  No?  
**[0:27:46-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:27:46):**  You've got a problem.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:27:47):**  If you're seeing a goodly number, okay, could be you know you start feeding lots of bacterium  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:27:53):**  fungi, they're going to eat those bacterium fungi and now things may balance out.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:27:57):**  Just keep an eye on them as you go through the growing season and you'll know in advance  
**[0:28:03-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:28:03):**  what's going wrong in the soil.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:28:06):**  Well given that we're kind of trying to suss out a lot of practical information, especially  
**[0:28:11-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:28:11):**  in these calls, because a lot of our audience are farmers and especially market gardeners.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:28:16):**  Can you talk about some of the best ways to add that microbiome back into the soil if  
**[0:28:21-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:28:21):**  it's lacking or how to build healthy soil, especially for that intensive annual vegetable  
**[0:28:27-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:28:27):**  production that a lot of our farmers are working with?  
**[0:28:30-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:28:30):**  Yep, so in the fall, so when you start out next fall, please get a microscope, get a  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:28:37):**  little bit of knowledge about what these different organisms look like so you can start to identify  
**[0:28:42-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:28:42):**  them and that's what our foundation classes do for people.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:28:46):**  The fourth foundation course is all about teaching you how to use the microscope and  
**[0:28:53-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:28:53):**  how to identify these organisms.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:28:56):**  We don't have to go down to genus species, not by any means, we just want to put them  
**[0:29:01-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:29:01):**  into the basic feeding groups, so bacterial feeding, fungal feeding, bacterial decomposition,  
**[0:29:08-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:29:08):**  fungal decomposition, so we have a good idea of what you have in the soil and if you see  
**[0:29:16-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:29:16):**  that you're lacking any of those organisms, then you're going to want to think about making  
**[0:29:23-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:29:23):**  compost.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:29:24):**  And wintertime is a great time to make compost because you don't have a whole lot of other  
**[0:29:28-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:29:28):**  things to do typically.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:29:30):**  If you're in tropical areas, it's during the dry time of the year, that's winter from a  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:29:36):**  tropical point of view is when you don't have enough water for anything to grow.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:29:42):**  What else do you have to do?  
**[0:29:43-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:29:43):**  Make compost.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:29:44):**  And so you want to collect your starting materials.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:29:48):**  We have certain recipes for the compost depending on whether you're in arid or not arid parts  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:29:55):**  of the world, so typically they're going to be around 10% high nitrogen.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:30:01):**  That's party food.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:30:02):**  That's going to, in a thermal pile, that's going to be what gets those bacteria and fungi  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:30:07):**  growing so rapidly that they increase the temperature.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:30:12):**  When you think about one bacterium becoming two bacteria, there's a significant increase  
**[0:30:18-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:30:18):**  in temperature because of the heat of reproduction.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:30:22):**  So if you're getting a thousand bacteria all reproducing in the same 20 minutes, how about  
**[0:30:29-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:30:29):**  a million?  
**[0:30:30-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:30:30):**  How about 10 million?  
**[0:30:31-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:30:31):**  You're definitely going to be increasing the temperature in that pile.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:30:35):**  And we want that temperature to get above 131 degrees Fahrenheit for a full three days  
**[0:30:41-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:30:41):**  because you will kill all the weed seed.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:30:43):**  You'll kill all the seed in that plant material that you put into the pile.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:30:49):**  We want to be able to kill all of the human pathogens, all the animal pathogens.  
**[0:30:54-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:30:54):**  Because their soil structure is so different from the more environmentally survivable bacterium  
**[0:31:03-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:31:03):**  fungi.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:31:05):**  The disease causing bacterium fungi are highly susceptible to those temperatures for fairly  
**[0:31:10-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:31:10):**  short periods of time.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:31:12):**  If you can get above 150 for 48 hours, 160, 65 for 24 hours, you're going to kill those  
**[0:31:22-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:31:22):**  pathogens and pass some parasites.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:31:25):**  They're dead.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:31:26):**  One of the few times I actually enjoy something dying is when we're dealing with the bad guys.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:31:34):**  What's growing, what's causing the temperature in that pile, and it drives me crazy when  
**[0:31:38-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:31:38):**  somebody says, now that your pile has reached 175 degrees, your pile is sterile.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:31:47):**  But how does the temperature remain high at 170, 175?  
**[0:31:52-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:31:52):**  How can it be maintained if you've got a sterile pile?  
**[0:31:56-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:31:56):**  So it's not sterile.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:31:58):**  There are lots of organisms that tolerate and grow and reproduce at those temperatures.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:32:05):**  When those organisms start running out of the simple foods, they've used them all up.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:32:11):**  So that's why we're putting in 30% green and 60% woody.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:32:16):**  Now you're going to have really good food for both the bacterium fungi, bacteria like  
**[0:32:22-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:32:22):**  the green stuff, fungi like the woody stuff.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:32:25):**  If your woody material doesn't impose, is it that there's something wrong with my recipe?  
**[0:32:32-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:32:32):**  Or is it because you don't have the organisms that decompose that woody material?  
**[0:32:38-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:32:38):**  So there's a message from Mother Nature.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:32:41):**  You should have had put in inoculum of as high a diversity of fungi as you possibly  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:32:49):**  could at the beginning of that composting process.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:32:53):**  You might be putting in some diseases and problem organisms if you're just going around  
**[0:32:58-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:32:58):**  collecting starting materials, but fine.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:33:01):**  That's why we're composting.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:33:02):**  That's why we're using a thermal composting process so that they'll, the bad guys will  
**[0:33:08-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:33:08):**  be killed, the good guys will flourish and multiply and you'll have massive diversity.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:33:14):**  Try to get as many different kinds of woody materials, brown materials as possible.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:33:19):**  The more diversity is going to result because you get lots of different starting materials.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:33:25):**  Don't just put in wood chips from pine.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:33:29):**  Put in wood chips from aspen and poplar and apple trees and everything you can possibly  
**[0:33:36-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:33:36):**  think of.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:33:37):**  A little bit of everything because that increases diversity and that means your soil is going  
**[0:33:43-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:33:43):**  to be able to deal with problems all the year long.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:33:48):**  So compost, thermal composting, we go through that whole process with you in our foundation  
**[0:33:54-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:33:54):**  courses.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:33:55):**  But what if you're not really into thermal composting because you got to pay attention  
**[0:33:59-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:33:59):**  to a thermal compost pile because it is getting to be high temperature and you better be watching  
**[0:34:05-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:34:05):**  and taking its temperature every day during the 10 to 15 days that it needs to be at high  
**[0:34:11-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:34:11):**  temperatures.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:34:12):**  As soon as it starts cooling off then fine, you don't have to pay much attention to that  
**[0:34:16-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:34:16):**  pile at all.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:34:17):**  But what if you just don't, your lifestyle doesn't, that's just not going to fit into  
**[0:34:21-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:34:21):**  your lifestyle.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:34:22):**  Then you make warm compost instead.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:34:25):**  It's the same kinds of starting materials except you're not going to put the high nitrogen  
**[0:34:30-0:34:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:34:30):**  in or you don't need to put the high nitrogen in.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:34:34):**  So let the worms do the job of changing the sets of microorganisms that are present in  
**[0:34:41-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:34:41):**  that plant material.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:34:43):**  And earthworms come with their whole back end of the worm is just a massive growth chamber  
**[0:34:52-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:34:52):**  for some of the best species of bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and nematodes that you can  
**[0:34:58-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:34:58):**  collect in your surroundings.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:35:02):**  Don't get the earthworms from just one little spot in the forest.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:35:05):**  Go out and take one worm from here and another worm from over there and another worm and  
**[0:35:09-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:35:09):**  another worm and another worm.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:35:11):**  There's some really interesting work by David Johnson where he's been looking at the species  
**[0:35:18-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:35:18):**  of bacteria.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:35:20):**  When you inoculate just one population of earthworm, you only have the same set of microorganisms  
**[0:35:28-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:35:28):**  in all your worm pits.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:35:31):**  And that means a limited diversity.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:35:34):**  So there has to be, you know, now that we know this, we have to start saying don't just  
**[0:35:40-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:35:40):**  get one batch of earthworm.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:35:43):**  You want to get, you know, maybe 10 or 20.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:35:46):**  So go to everybody else's worm bin pile and take a little bit with you and get those organisms  
**[0:35:51-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:35:51):**  inoculated into the pile.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:35:54):**  So I don't know if I've answered all of your question, but I think I've probably run out  
**[0:35:57-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:35:57):**  of my fair share of the time here.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:36:00):**  You're fine.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:36:01):**  Those are all great suggestions.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:36:02):**  John, same to you.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:36:04):**  What recommendations do you give, especially to intensive annual vegetable growers, on  
**[0:36:08-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:36:08):**  how they can provide the adequate nutrition in their soil to have a successful growing  
**[0:36:12-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:36:12):**  season?  
**[0:36:15-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:36:15):**  Depending on what you just described, Elaine, I think compost, vermicompost or thermal compost,  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:36:21):**  different, also Johnson-Sue bioreactors, compost is a very valuable and very necessary contribution  
**[0:36:27-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:36:27):**  in these very intensively managed production ecosystems for market gardens and so forth.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:36:33):**  And our experience, I would suggest two additional pieces that we should consider adding to that.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:36:40):**  One of them is purchased inoculants.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:36:42):**  And my experience with purchased inoculants comes as a result of, I guess, let me say  
**[0:36:53-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:36:53):**  it this way.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:36:54):**  We know that we have, my understanding is that we have very rapid exchange of genetic  
**[0:36:58-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:36:58):**  information between different groups of soil microbial communities.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:37:02):**  And we live in an environment today where depending on where our compost materials are  
**[0:37:07-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:37:07):**  coming from, we get exposure to lots of different pesticides and lots of hydrocarbons.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:37:14):**  And it's possible for us to get microbial inoculants that have the genetic information  
**[0:37:19-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:37:19):**  to bioremediate those hydrocarbons very quickly.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:37:22):**  And our experience has been that when we apply these types of biology to agricultural soils,  
**[0:37:29-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:37:29):**  we get surprisingly strong crop responses.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:37:32):**  So we're evaluating the effectiveness of these materials based on crop response.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:37:36):**  And the crop response has been really extraordinary.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:37:39):**  So I think that's something that we should really consider and keep your eyes open for.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:37:44):**  And then I would also add that while compost is a very valuable, or inoculants and or inoculants  
**[0:37:52-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:37:52):**  are very valuable and I believe necessary contributions, we also need to remember that  
**[0:37:56-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:37:56):**  there are many soil microbial populations that can only thrive and reproduce in the  
**[0:38:01-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:38:01):**  presence of a living root system.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:38:03):**  So for example, rhizofungi are perhaps the classical example, there's many others as  
**[0:38:07-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:38:07):**  well.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:38:08):**  And so I would suggest that one other piece that we need to consider is we need to grow  
**[0:38:14-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:38:14):**  diverse crops and cover crops that can feed an abundant microbial population.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:38:20):**  And that is also foundational to really regenerating our soils microbial community.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:38:24):**  So I was asked to do a presentation a couple months ago for the Bio-Nutrient Food Association  
**[0:38:30-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:38:30):**  where I was asked to put together kind of these high level principles of how do we develop  
**[0:38:35-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:38:35):**  these market garden soils to very high levels and very high plateaus of performance.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:38:40):**  And my recommendation was that fundamentally, we need to consider the living microbial zone  
**[0:38:47-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:38:47):**  in the soil, whether that's a depth of four inches or 20 inches.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:38:52):**  We need to manage that as if though we were managing a petri dish in a laboratory, or  
**[0:38:58-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:38:58):**  you could say as if though you were managing a sheet composting pile.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:39:01):**  So that means that you cannot let it be exposed to the sun, because when you expose it to  
**[0:39:07-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:39:07):**  the sun, high levels of oxidizing radiation, that is going to shut down microbial populations.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:39:14):**  And you need to manage water, particularly excessive water.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:39:17):**  So we live in a very different world today from what we need to acknowledge that we have  
**[0:39:23-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:39:23):**  vagaries of the climate that are much more severe than they were even a decade or two  
**[0:39:28-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:39:28):**  decades ago.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:39:29):**  So soil biology can recover quite nicely from drying out.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:39:35):**  And obviously, it also recovers from being saturated.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:39:38):**  But our experience has been that in these biologically managed systems, having saturated  
**[0:39:45-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:39:45):**  soils for extended periods of time really does a number on the soil biological population  
**[0:39:51-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:39:51):**  and on crop performance.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:39:52):**  It's much more damaging than having soil dry out.  
**[0:39:55-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:39:55):**  And so I believe it is critical importance for us that we need to develop our rainfall  
**[0:40:05-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:40:05):**  management in the landscape to the point where we have the capacity to handle three to five  
**[0:40:11-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:40:11):**  inches of rain in 24 hours.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:40:13):**  That seems to be happening multiple times per season in many parts of the world.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:40:17):**  So whether that means very shallow subsurface irrigation, whether that means contouring  
**[0:40:24-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:40:24):**  to move surface water off, whatever it is that that means for the local landscape, that  
**[0:40:28-0:40:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:40:28):**  piece needs to be figured out because keeping soil saturated for extended periods of time  
**[0:40:33-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:40:33):**  is a significant problem for that petri dish in the microbially active zone.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:40:37):**  So those are the thoughts that I would add.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:40:39):**  Well, while we're on the topic of soil amendments, and seeing as it's a large part of the business  
**[0:40:45-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:40:45):**  that you run too is the inoculants for kickstarting the function of the ecology.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:40:51):**  Can you tell us about some of those inoculants that you found most successful and most applicable  
**[0:40:57-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:40:57):**  on a broad sense, but again, especially towards the market gardening or vegetable production  
**[0:41:01-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:41:01):**  side, just because it's a large portion of our farmers at the moment.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:41:06):**  Yeah, I didn't really come here to do an infomercial.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:41:10):**  And I guess I'm really not actually when I start to think about it because we actually  
**[0:41:14-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:41:14):**  don't produce any microbial inoculants on our own.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:41:18):**  So what we use commercially is we use mycorrhizal fungi inoculants on just about every time  
**[0:41:25-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:41:25):**  a seed is planted, and particularly for annual crops.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:41:28):**  And if you have a perennial ecosystem or crops that have living roots present all the time,  
**[0:41:34-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:41:34):**  the intention and the goal should be to establish a population of mycorrhizal fungi and other  
**[0:41:39-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:41:39):**  fungi that does not need to be constantly re-inoculated.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:41:42):**  And so it's certainly been successful with that.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:41:45):**  We often inoculate only for the first year or two and then expect that population to  
**[0:41:49-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:41:49):**  maintain itself.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:41:52):**  And then we also use microbial inoculants from Teneo technology.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:41:58):**  And the reason we use that company's products is because 10 years ago, 15 years ago, when  
**[0:42:04-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:42:04):**  we first started, we did extensive research in the field comparing different companies'  
**[0:42:11-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:42:11):**  inoculants.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:42:12):**  And when we look at purchased inoculants, I'm sure Elaine could give us a long list  
**[0:42:17-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:42:17):**  of possible downsides.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:42:19):**  And they do have potential possible, I shouldn't say downsides, but potential lack of effectiveness  
**[0:42:25-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:42:25):**  because their effectiveness is really context dependent.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:42:29):**  It depends on where you put them and how they're managed.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:42:33):**  And the question that should be asked of those people who manufacture mycorrhizal inoculants  
**[0:42:39-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:42:39):**  is not how much does it improve crop performance, how much does it improve yield or whatever  
**[0:42:45-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:42:45):**  the case might be.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:42:46):**  Instead, the question is, what percentage of the time do you observe crop results or  
**[0:42:52-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:42:52):**  not observe crop results?  
**[0:42:54-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:42:54):**  That's a much better question to ask because these, in fact, it's a better question to  
**[0:42:59-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:42:59):**  ask not just of mycorrhizal inoculants, but of biological practices in general, because  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:43:05):**  the reality is that the results are really context dependent on what's happening in that  
**[0:43:10-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:43:10):**  local geology and in that local landscape.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:43:12):**  Okay, and Elaine, perhaps expanding more on the compost side of things, since you're very  
**[0:43:17-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:43:17):**  well known for that specialty, there's been a number of questions about different forms  
**[0:43:21-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:43:21):**  of compost, especially different anaerobic methods and aerobic methods like Bokashi and  
**[0:43:27-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:43:27):**  others.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:43:29):**  Could you say a few words on the applications and the different efficacies of those different  
**[0:43:33-0:43:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:43:33):**  types?  
**[0:43:34-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:43:34):**  Well, it's, I think, you know, we probably have a little controversy going with, you  
**[0:43:40-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:43:40):**  know, what is Korean natural farming with the use of the anaerobic compost teas.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:43:46):**  And it's not that anaerobic compost teas don't have a role and function, you just need to  
**[0:43:53-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:43:53):**  know what that role and function is.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:43:57):**  You go and make purposely make something anaerobic.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:44:02):**  The aerobic organisms that were on those bits and pieces of soil, organic matter in that  
**[0:44:10-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:44:10):**  compost tea, they're going to either, well, their enzymes only function when the oxygen  
**[0:44:20-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:44:20):**  is at a certain level or above.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:44:23):**  As that oxygen starts to get restrictive for the aerobic organisms, they're either going  
**[0:44:29-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:44:29):**  to die if the loss of oxygen is very rapid, many of those bacteria or fungi or protozoa  
**[0:44:36-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:44:36):**  nematodes are going to just out and out die because it's too fast to change for them.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:44:41):**  If there's enough time, they will produce spores.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:44:44):**  And so they'll make it out the other end, whenever that material is, gets aerated again,  
**[0:44:51-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:44:51):**  those organisms will germinate and start to grow.  
**[0:44:54-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:44:54):**  So it's not like complete and total wipeout.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:45:00):**  You just have to control the system so that those aerobic organisms have enough time to  
**[0:45:08-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:45:08):**  produce the spores, the dormant stages.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:45:11):**  So now you've dropped down into anaerobic, below 6 pounds PBM, and your anaerobic organisms  
**[0:45:24-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:45:24):**  are starting to wake up because now their enzymes are working.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:45:28):**  They're functioning in the atmosphere that lacks oxygen.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:45:34):**  And now they're capable of taking all of these proteins and amino acids and sugars and lipopolysaccharides,  
**[0:45:41-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:45:41):**  et cetera, and converting that into more bacteria and they're releasing waste products that  
**[0:45:48-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:45:48):**  are typically organic acids.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:45:52):**  A lot of them are volatile organic acids.  
**[0:45:54-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:45:54):**  You're going to lose your nitrogen into the atmosphere because those bacteria have converted  
**[0:46:01-0:46:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:46:01):**  the NO3 or the NH4 into NH2.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:46:07):**  So you're losing, it's not NH2, it's N2, sorry.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:46:14):**  Too many things going through my head all at the same time.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:46:17):**  So you're going to lose that nitrogen as a gas, as ammonia, NH3.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:46:23):**  With your sulfur, your sulfur in the aerated forms, SO4, SO3, SO2, so all of your sulfur  
**[0:46:30-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:46:30):**  compounds in your soils will be converted into H2S, hydrogen sulfide, which smells like  
**[0:46:41-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:46:41):**  rotten eggs.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:46:42):**  So you can detect when this is happening.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:46:43):**  You can detect the smell of ammonia.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:46:46):**  And you're losing nutrients.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:46:48):**  So now what good is it for you to be putting that compost tea on your soil because you've  
**[0:46:54-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:46:54):**  lost the very nutrients that you wanted to have get into your soil.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:47:00):**  You're producing organic acids.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:47:02):**  You're producing like, acidic acid vinegar is a very common one.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:47:08):**  Lactic acid is another very common one.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:47:11):**  A whole slew of them.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:47:13):**  And you can watch your pH drop in your compost tea from, you might have started out at 7,  
**[0:47:20-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:47:20):**  7.5, it starts to drop down to 6.5, 5, 5.5, 4.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:47:28):**  I have seen compost teas that have ended up with a pH around 3.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:47:34):**  So imagine what you're doing when you're taking a liquid that is that low in pH, that acidic,  
**[0:47:42-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:47:42):**  and now you're spraying it on your plants.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:47:44):**  You can kill a lot of stuff with that.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:47:48):**  Well, it's really a pesticide now, isn't it?  
**[0:47:53-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:47:53):**  It's not a positive nutrient fertilizer.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:47:59):**  It's now something that is so acidic that you're going to cause some trouble perhaps.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:48:08):**  And we've seen that sort of problem with the burning marks around the edges of the leaves  
**[0:48:13-0:48:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:48:13):**  when you let that get too anaerobic.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:48:16):**  So what if you don't let it get that anaerobic?  
**[0:48:20-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:48:20):**  Well, it's a really good fungicide.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:48:24):**  So you can put those organic acids out and you can really knock back something like a  
**[0:48:30-0:48:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:48:30):**  verticillium or epithium or a phytophthora infection on the surfaces of your plants or  
**[0:48:36-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:48:36):**  down in the root system.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:48:38):**  So you're going to wipe out a lot of those organisms.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:48:41):**  So you can have a beneficial effect from that, but by applying all of those organic acids  
**[0:48:50-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:48:50):**  to your soil, you've killed a lot of the beneficials as well.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:48:56):**  So how much damage has been done to the disease-causing organisms?  
**[0:49:02-0:49:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:49:02):**  Yay!  
**[0:49:03-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:49:03):**  How much damage has been done to the beneficial organisms that would, they should, be there  
**[0:49:08-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:49:08):**  to help your system recover?  
**[0:49:10-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:49:10):**  Well, you killed them.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:49:12):**  So if you don't do anything, what's going to come back into the soil on its own?  
**[0:49:19-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:49:19):**  In about two to maybe three weeks, what you find is that the disease-causing organisms  
**[0:49:25-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:49:25):**  have recovered more rapidly because that's their life history strategy.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:49:30):**  If just one cell survives, it's going to become six million cells by tomorrow and the day  
**[0:49:38-0:49:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:49:38):**  after it's going to be a billion cells and the day after, yep, now you've got the disease  
**[0:49:43-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:49:43):**  coming right back at you or another disease coming along behind the first one that you  
**[0:49:48-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:49:48):**  hopefully got rid of.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:49:51):**  So if you do use those anaerobic teas, let me recommend to you that the way to allow  
**[0:49:57-0:50:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:49:57):**  you to use the anaerobic teas is to immediately come back with a good compost, a fully aerobic  
**[0:50:05-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:50:05):**  compost tea, where you have all the active, growing, living, healthy, happy air robes  
**[0:50:11-0:50:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:50:11):**  in that system who can rebuild the structure in the soil, who can deal with those organic  
**[0:50:18-0:50:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:50:18):**  acids and convert them back into bacterial and fungal biomass.  
**[0:50:22-0:50:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:50:22):**  So it's not like, you know, you would never think to do this.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:50:27):**  No, no, no, that's not what I said.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:50:30):**  Know what you're doing.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:50:32):**  Know what's the consequence of altering the biology like this and, you know, where you  
**[0:50:38-0:50:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:50:38):**  have those kind of specific questions, give me a call or, you know, info at soilfoodweb.com  
**[0:50:45-0:50:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:50:45):**  to get some of your questions answered.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:50:49):**  Yes, we are going to charge you for our time answering your questions.  
**[0:50:53-0:50:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:50:53):**  Sorry, we've got to stay alive too.  
**[0:50:55-0:50:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:50:55):**  I have to pay all these salaries.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:50:58):**  So understanding and that's really what I want people to do is have an understanding  
**[0:51:04-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:51:04):**  of the consequences of what they're doing.  
**[0:51:08-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:51:08):**  And is it anaerobic or aerobic?  
**[0:51:10-0:51:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:51:10):**  And that's like what what John was talking about, where you have water sitting in your  
**[0:51:16-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:51:16):**  field for weeks on end, you know, if the flooding is not in filter, well, why isn't the water  
**[0:51:23-0:51:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:51:23):**  going into your soil?  
**[0:51:25-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:51:25):**  Because you got a compaction layer.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:51:27):**  And there's no way that that water can drain eventually it's going to either evaporate  
**[0:51:31-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:51:31):**  or it's going to go downhill.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:51:33):**  And when that water goes downhill, it's taking a lot of your topsoil with it, you don't really  
**[0:51:39-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:51:39):**  want that to happen.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:51:40):**  You want infiltration.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:51:42):**  What builds infiltration?  
**[0:51:44-0:51:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:51:44):**  What takes out the compaction and turns it back into good fluffy soil that you don't  
**[0:51:50-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:51:50):**  have to fluff?  
**[0:51:51-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:51:51):**  Well, it is the biology.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:51:53):**  So get the biology out there.  
**[0:51:54-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:51:54):**  Well, it's not doing the job yet.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:51:56):**  Okay, you don't have any understory plants, you've got to get out plants that are present  
**[0:52:02-0:52:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:52:02):**  and growing all year round.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:52:06):**  You really want something that's going to green up and start growing in the springtime  
**[0:52:09-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:52:09):**  before your crop goes in.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:52:12):**  Yep, you can have furrows and you drop your seed into the furrows, maybe along with a  
**[0:52:18-0:52:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:52:18):**  little microbial inoculum of all of the species, not just one or two species of bacteria, one  
**[0:52:24-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:52:24):**  or two species of fungi.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:52:26):**  Let's get the whole diversity.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:52:28):**  So you're not going to have growth just for a few weeks in the summertime, you're going  
**[0:52:33-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:52:33):**  to have growth aided and abetted by these really beneficial organisms throughout the  
**[0:52:38-0:52:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:52:38):**  whole entire growing season.  
**[0:52:41-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:52:41):**  So let's get that biology out there.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:52:44):**  If you've got permanent understory plants, they're perennials, you only have to buy the  
**[0:52:49-0:52:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:52:49):**  seeds for them once in your entire lifetime.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:52:53):**  And then those understory plants will protect that soil surface from the impact of rain  
**[0:52:59-0:53:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:52:59):**  on the surface of the soil that is so destructive.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:53:03):**  In some instances, rainfall is the most compacting thing you can get.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:53:09):**  Forget your tractor, forget your animals.  
**[0:53:12-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:53:12):**  It's rainfall if you've got bare soil.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:53:15):**  So get some vegetation, mulch if nothing else, to protect that soil surface and allow better  
**[0:53:22-0:53:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:53:22):**  infiltration.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:53:23):**  And allow that compaction.  
**[0:53:26-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:53:26):**  And usually people say, well, the rain doesn't compact my soil.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:53:28):**  Yes, it does.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:53:29):**  It just doesn't do it at the surface.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:53:31):**  It may do it down at three inches or six inches or 10 inches, depending on all kinds of factors.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:53:39):**  So I could go on and on, but I'll break off now.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:53:42):**  No, no, this is great.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:53:44):**  And both from your comments and John's, we've had just an influx of extra questions and  
**[0:53:48-0:53:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:53:48):**  people are really engaged about these topics.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:53:50):**  I'm really thrilled about the reaction here.  
**[0:53:53-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:53:53):**  But since we focus so much on market gardening context for the most part up until now, let's  
**[0:53:58-0:54:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:53:58):**  talk briefly before we hand it over to listen to questions about broader acreage applications.  
**[0:54:03-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:54:03):**  And there's a lot of talk between the most effective and the most, I guess, economical  
**[0:54:08-0:54:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:54:08):**  way of regenerating soils on broad acreage, whether it's cover crops, whether it's rotational  
**[0:54:13-0:54:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:54:13):**  grazing, whether it's a mix of many different methods.  
**[0:54:17-0:54:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:54:17):**  John, can you start by talking about some of the results that you've seen out in larger  
**[0:54:22-0:54:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:54:22):**  acreage applications about, yeah, broad applications of regenerating soil at an effective and economic  
**[0:54:31-0:54:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:54:31):**  scale?  
**[0:54:32-0:54:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:54:32):**  I'm very passionate about having regenerative agriculture become the status quo globally  
**[0:54:37-0:54:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:54:37):**  in the next two decades.  
**[0:54:39-0:54:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:54:39):**  And so I'm very deliberate about thinking and thinking about how do we get there from  
**[0:54:43-0:54:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:54:43):**  here?  
**[0:54:44-0:54:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:54:44):**  We've achieved a point where we have 85% adoption globally by 2040.  
**[0:54:50-0:54:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:54:50):**  And I believe that if you want to achieve anything, you achieve what you incentivize.  
**[0:54:56-0:55:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:54:56):**  So it's very important for any types of recommendations that we make.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:55:00):**  If we want to have rapid adoption, we need to show an economic response immediately,  
**[0:55:05-0:55:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:55:05):**  not deferred three years, five years down the road, but there needs to be an immediate  
**[0:55:09-0:55:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:55:09):**  economic response.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:55:10):**  And so this has been the foundation, one of the foundational thesis of our work at Advancing  
**[0:55:16-0:55:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:55:16):**  Eco-Agriculture.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:55:17):**  And we have observed when we constantly are evaluating different types of recommendations,  
**[0:55:26-0:55:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:55:26):**  and the two recommendations that produce the most immediate economic response that facilitate  
**[0:55:31-0:55:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:55:31):**  the transition to regenerative agriculture are, number one is inoculants applied at planting  
**[0:55:39-0:55:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:55:39):**  as a seed treatment.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:55:41):**  They are relatively inexpensive, usually costing a few dollars per acre.  
**[0:55:45-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:55:45):**  And while not always effective, they are effective consistently enough, often enough that they  
**[0:55:51-0:55:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:55:51):**  deliver very strong ROI and they begin to help facilitate that transition to a more  
**[0:55:56-0:55:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:55:56):**  regenerative approach.  
**[0:55:57-0:55:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:55:57):**  So that's one.  
**[0:55:59-0:56:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:55:59):**  The second most significant economic crop response is from the use of properly designed,  
**[0:56:06-0:56:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:56:06):**  and that's a key phrase, properly designed foliar applications of nutrients that are  
**[0:56:10-0:56:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:56:10):**  specifically designed to increase a plant's photosynthetic performance.  
**[0:56:14-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:56:14):**  And this is a key aspect, a key element that is completely missing from all that I have  
**[0:56:22-0:56:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:56:22):**  seen from all of our carbon sequestration research.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:56:26):**  It is assumed that photosynthesis is a constant.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:56:30):**  It's not.  
**[0:56:32-0:56:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:56:32):**  Photosynthesis is not a constant.  
**[0:56:34-0:56:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:56:34):**  Photosynthesis does not happen at a constant rate.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:56:37):**  Photosynthesis is highly variable based on the concentrations of carbon dioxide in the  
**[0:56:41-0:56:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:56:41):**  atmosphere, based on sunlight, based on available water and all these other things.  
**[0:56:45-0:56:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:56:45):**  And what we consider to be normal, what we consider to be common is crops that are photosynthesizing  
**[0:56:52-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:56:52):**  somewhere in the neighborhood of about 15 to 20% of their inherent photosynthetic capacity.  
**[0:56:57-0:57:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:56:57):**  It's not reasonable to anticipate that we'll get to 100% capacity in an outdoor agriculture  
**[0:57:03-0:57:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:57:03):**  environment because that would require an ideal environment with an ideal context.  
**[0:57:08-0:57:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:57:08):**  It would require everything to be optimal.  
**[0:57:11-0:57:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:57:11):**  That isn't likely to happen on a continual basis in most outdoor production agriculture,  
**[0:57:16-0:57:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:57:16):**  but it is reasonable to expect that we can get to 40% or 60% of photosynthetic capacity,  
**[0:57:24-0:57:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:57:24):**  which would mean that we get two to three times more sugar production in each 24-hour  
**[0:57:27-0:57:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:57:27):**  photo period than what is presently common.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:57:30):**  Now, when you think about the implications of that, what does that mean for carbon sequestration?  
**[0:57:37-0:57:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:57:37):**  And that is never considered in any of the research that is being done on the capacity  
**[0:57:43-0:57:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:57:43):**  of agriculture ecosystems for carbon sequestration.  
**[0:57:46-0:57:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:57:46):**  So anyway, getting back to the focus of your question, our observation has been that when  
**[0:57:53-0:57:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:57:53):**  foliar sprays are properly designed to increase that plant's photosynthetic capacity, plants  
**[0:57:59-0:58:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:57:59):**  capture a lot more carbon dioxide, they capture a lot more solar energy.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:58:06):**  Photosynthesis is really the only way we have of bringing new energy into the ecosystem.  
**[0:58:10-0:58:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:58:10):**  So when we spike photosynthesis, that doesn't just mean we get more plant yield and more  
**[0:58:16-0:58:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:58:16):**  growth that offers an economic incentive to growers.  
**[0:58:19-0:58:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:58:19):**  It also means that we transmit much larger quantities of root exudates into the soil  
**[0:58:26-0:58:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:58:26):**  microbiome to feed soil biology, and we build biology much faster than we do with a normal  
**[0:58:33-0:58:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:58:33):**  crop.  
**[0:58:34-0:58:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:58:34):**  So, and I'm using this word normal or common in the context.  
**[0:58:39-0:58:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:58:39):**  We should ask what really is normal?  
**[0:58:41-0:58:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:58:41):**  Most of us don't really have any idea what healthy plants actually look like anymore.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:58:46):**  We think that a healthy plant is a plant that might have susceptibility to diseases and  
**[0:58:51-0:58:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:58:51):**  insects.  
**[0:58:52-0:58:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:58:52):**  Well, if you have diseases and insects, you do not have a healthy plant.  
**[0:58:55-0:58:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:58:55):**  It's really that simple.  
**[0:58:56-0:59:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:58:56):**  You do not have a plant that is photosynthesizing at optimal efficiency.  
**[0:59:00-0:59:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:59:00):**  So I think it is worth pointing out.  
**[0:59:07-0:59:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:59:07):**  We have been framing this conversation up to this point largely in terms of managing  
**[0:59:11-0:59:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:59:11):**  biology, which is extremely important, but increasing photosynthesis and increasing the  
**[0:59:17-0:59:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:59:17):**  quality and the health of an overall ecosystem has a foundation on two pieces, microbiome  
**[0:59:26-0:59:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:59:26):**  integrity and nutritional integrity.  
**[0:59:31-0:59:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:59:31):**  Those are certainly tied together.  
**[0:59:32-0:59:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:59:32):**  They're certainly synergistic, but because you have one does not necessarily mean you  
**[0:59:36-0:59:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:59:36):**  have the other.  
**[0:59:37-0:59:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:59:37):**  And in fact, in the case of, as Elaine pointed out earlier, you can have perfectly balanced  
**[0:59:42-0:59:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:59:42):**  chemistry in the soil, according to a laboratory assay, but still have unhealthy plants.  
**[0:59:46-0:59:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:59:46):**  So we need to manage both of those systems very well.  
**[0:59:50-0:59:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:59:50):**  So anyway, we begin, when we first begin working with growers who want to make a transition  
**[0:59:58-1:00:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=0:59:58):**  on a large scale, I'm talking a scale of thousands or tens of thousands of acres, who want to  
**[1:00:01-1:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:00:01):**  make a transition to regenerative agriculture practices, we begin by looking at the cultural  
**[1:00:08-1:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:00:08):**  management practices and the use of products that will offer an immediate economic return  
**[1:00:14-1:00:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:00:14):**  this year.  
**[1:00:15-1:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:00:15):**  And then we compound that.  
**[1:00:17-1:00:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:00:17):**  And we often don't begin with large compost applications and the intensive use of cover  
**[1:00:24-1:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:00:24):**  crops in the first year.  
**[1:00:26-1:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:00:26):**  That is usually happens in year two or year three, depending again, of course, on context  
**[1:00:31-1:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:00:31):**  and local availability of resources.  
**[1:00:33-1:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:00:33):**  So everything is context dependent.  
**[1:00:37-1:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:00:37):**  All of these different practices that fit into regenerative principles are useful and  
**[1:00:42-1:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:00:42):**  appropriate.  
**[1:00:43-1:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:00:43):**  And some of them are just a lot more useful and more appropriate at specific times in  
**[1:00:47-1:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:00:47):**  a specific context than others.  
**[1:00:51-1:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:00:51):**  Thanks once again to our two panelists, Dr. Elaine Ingham and John Kempf, who are both  
**[1:00:55-1:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:00:55):**  working tirelessly to create a healthier and more resilient farm culture around the world.  
**[1:01:00-1:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:01:00):**  I highly recommend that you check out their work.  
**[1:01:02-1:01:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:01:02):**  You can find Dr. Elaine's company at soilfoodweb.com and John's at both advancingecoag.com and

**[1:01:10-1:01:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:01:10):**  And a special thanks to the team at Climate Farmers for organizing the event and to all  
**[1:01:15-1:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:01:15):**  the wonderful people who showed up and participated in the chat.  
**[1:01:19-1:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:01:19):**  Now as great as it is to include multiple experience perspectives on the topics that  
**[1:01:22-1:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:01:22):**  we covered in this panel, it's impossible to include the full range of opinions and  
**[1:01:26-1:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:01:26):**  viewpoints out there.  
**[1:01:28-1:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:01:28):**  And that's why I'm inviting you to join the growing community building regenerative skills  
**[1:01:31-1:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:01:31):**  to use in their daily lives.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:01:34):**  It'll always be free to join.  
**[1:01:35-1:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:01:35):**  All you have to do is follow the links to our Discord on the homepage of the regenerative  
**[1:01:40-1:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:01:40):**  skills website.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:01:41):**  The benefit of joining through our Discord channel is that unlike social media platforms  
**[1:01:45-1:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:01:45):**  that mine your personal data and manipulate your feeds based on algorithms to sell you  
**[1:01:49-1:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:01:49):**  more junk, I founded these channels purely for knowledge, skill, and story exchange between  
**[1:01:54-1:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:01:54):**  the people who care to make their worlds better for everyone.  
**[1:01:57-1:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:01:57):**  Now this week's question, which we'll be discussing on the forum, is, how can you test to determine  
**[1:02:03-1:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:02:03):**  the health of the food web in your own soil?  
**[1:02:06-1:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:02:06):**  What indicators do you look for to see whether it needs attention and stewardship, or that  
**[1:02:09-1:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:02:09):**  it is functioning optimally?  
**[1:02:11-1:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:02:11):**  Of course, soil is at the very base of the health of all of our terrestrial ecosystems,  
**[1:02:16-1:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:02:16):**  and I'd love to hear about how you manage its health and resilience on your farm or  
**[1:02:21-1:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:02:21):**  garden.  
**[1:02:22-1:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:02:22):**  Don't forget you can also help to guide the panel discussions that I've got planned for  
**[1:02:25-1:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:02:25):**  the future by suggesting topics and guests on the Discord forum too.  
**[1:02:30-1:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:02:30):**  So that's our show for this week, until next time, keep taking those little steps every  
**[1:02:34-1:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regenerating-the-biology-in-your-soil-expert-panel-4/#t=1:02:34):**  day towards a regenerative future, and I'll be right by your side along the way!

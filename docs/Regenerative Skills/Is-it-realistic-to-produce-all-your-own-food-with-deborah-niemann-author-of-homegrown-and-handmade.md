**[0:12:29-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:12:29):**  I can only imagine.

**[0:12:38-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:12:38):**  of how do you divide up your time to keeping that place running?  
**[0:12:44-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:12:44):**  Basically we just have to do all the daily chores for all the animals.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:12:47):**  We've got sheep, goats, pigs and chickens.

**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:12:56):**  We had cattle for over 10 years which we finally gave up on because they were just big and  
**[0:13:02-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:13:02):**  scary and as our kids started moving away I was afraid that they were going to get out  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:13:07):**  one day when I was home alone and I had no idea how I would get them back if I was by  
**[0:13:11-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:13:11):**  myself.

**[0:13:21-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:13:21):**  now we have grass-fed lamb and goat and chicken and eggs.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:13:30):**  The main thing we sell right now is we sell eggs at a grocery store.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:13:35):**  So a lot of the income is not directly coming from animal products?  
**[0:13:41-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:13:41):**  We also sell freezer meat so we sell the whole animal and then take it to the locker for  
**[0:13:48-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:13:48):**  somebody and then so instead of buying a package of ground pork they buy a pig and the pig  
**[0:13:57-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:13:57):**  winds up weighing 150 pounds and they pay us four dollars and fifty cents a pound for  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:14:03):**  that pig and then they tell the locker what they want them to do with it and the locker  
**[0:14:08-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:14:08):**  turns it into whatever they want.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:14:10):**  You know if that includes sausage or bacon or ham or you know if they just want it all  
**[0:14:15-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:14:15):**  ground up to be ground pork or whatever.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:14:18):**  Nice is a really good a very efficient system cutting out all those middlemen.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:14:23):**  So okay so let's focus a little bit on your book Homegrown and Handmade.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:14:29):**  In there you claim that you produce a hundred percent of your own meat, eggs, maple syrup  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:14:35):**  and dairy products as well as a really good portion of your vegetables, your fruit, herbs  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:14:39):**  and honey.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:14:40):**  Now while I know that represents a big part of the goals of people who idealize the homesteading  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:14:47):**  lifestyle that's a really tall stack for anyone to achieve.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:14:51):**  Can you give me an idea about how much time, land and investment it's taken you to reach  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:14:58):**  that point of self-sufficiency?  
**[0:15:02-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:15:02):**  Well we have 32 acres but we honestly we could do what we wanted to do on 10 acres.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:15:09):**  We overbought because we thought we needed this much.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:15:14):**  And our property has a creek that runs through it which essentially made two-thirds of it  
**[0:15:19-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:15:19):**  very difficult to use.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:15:22):**  And so we learned fairly quickly like oh yeah we really don't need all those other acres.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:15:31):**  And it's not you know it sounds challenging but like that because our original goal was  
**[0:15:36-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:15:36):**  just to grow things for ourselves but the reason we wound up selling things is because  
**[0:15:42-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:15:42):**  we wound up producing more than we needed.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:15:44):**  Like if you have a pig she's gonna have depending on what breed she's gonna have somewhere between  
**[0:15:48-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:15:48):**  you know five and ten babies and most families are not gonna eat that much pork in a year.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:15:57):**  So you wind up like oh okay I need to find some people who want to buy pork from us.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:16:04):**  And with the sheep we realized also that you know well if we were gonna breed them we really  
**[0:16:12-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:16:12):**  don't need that many sheep.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:16:14):**  Like we started with two ewes, two pregnant ewes and within only three or four years we  
**[0:16:21-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:16:21):**  had 20 sheep because we wanted our own wool and that which is really fun.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:16:27):**  It's a whole another level but yeah we're like oh my gosh we have 20 sheep we don't  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:16:32):**  need this much wool so we need to start selling it.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:16:36):**  And so that's kind of it the whole thing honestly it was a lot easier than we were expecting  
**[0:16:43-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:16:43):**  it to be and so that was how we wound up selling stuff was because we wound up with so much  
**[0:16:50-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:16:50):**  more than what we needed.  
**[0:16:53-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:16:53):**  And so does the sale of this mostly go to justify the expenses of keeping and maintaining  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:17:01):**  the animals or is there a good profit for you on this smaller scale?  
**[0:17:07-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:17:07):**  It is profitable but it's not enough to live on because like it sounds like so much when  
**[0:17:14-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:17:14):**  you're like oh you can get you make what like seven hundred dollars from a pig like oh my  
**[0:17:22-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:17:22):**  gosh that sounds like a lot right?  
**[0:17:24-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:17:24):**  Seven hundred dollars for one pig.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:17:26):**  Well yeah but then if you start doing math well ten pigs is only seven thousand dollars  
**[0:17:33-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:17:33):**  which kind of sounds like a lot until you think about well how much do I need to live  
**[0:17:37-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:17:37):**  for a year?  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:17:39):**  Right it's not seven thousand dollars every month you're turning over ten pigs.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:17:43):**  How long do you keep them there?  
**[0:17:45-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:17:45):**  Is it six or eight months?  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:17:47):**  And depends on what breed you have but yeah six would be the minimum.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:17:52):**  And you know some of the breed like we have American guinea hogs now which is it's over  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:17:56):**  a year for them to get big enough to butcher.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:18:00):**  Yeah and it that's not seven thousand dollars of profit that's minus the cost of feed and  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:18:07):**  occasionally vet bills or I mean there's all sorts of things that come up in the maintenance  
**[0:18:11-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:18:11):**  of animals.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:18:13):**  Exactly right yeah.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:18:17):**  In that how much time investment is it for you and I assume it's just your husband at  
**[0:18:24-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:18:24):**  this point or do you have still some of your children living with you?  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:18:27):**  Yeah so that's the thing that got to be kind of tricky you know people would say wow that's  
**[0:18:31-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:18:31):**  a lot of work isn't it?  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:18:33):**  And back in the beginning I would say yeah but you know what there's five of us so really  
**[0:18:37-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:18:37):**  it's just like each person only has about 45 minutes to an hour you know morning and  
**[0:18:41-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:18:41):**  evening and we did and then one child went away to college and another and another and  
**[0:18:48-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:18:48):**  then you do the math on that right like multiply that times five and now you're looking at  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:18:56):**  eight to ten hours a day total for one person.

**[0:23:17-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:23:17):**  the garden none of us ate cucumbers and so there was nothing to do with the cucumbers.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:23:23):**  We do eat cucumbers now you know because at one point I was like okay this is ridiculous  
**[0:23:28-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:23:28):**  we need to eat the cucumbers.

**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:23:39):**  around to that and so it was like what do you do with fresh cucumbers?  
**[0:23:45-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:23:45):**  And so I had to learn how to do that and so after making a list of what you're going to  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:23:57):**  grow.

**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:25:24):**  you're going to do with stuff and also to grow things that are really expensive to buy  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:25:28):**  or things that you can't buy at all.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:25:31):**  How much space are you using for your own garden at this point?  
**[0:25:35-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:25:35):**  What we added is, it kind of depends on what you're talking about specifically what we're  
**[0:25:44-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:25:44):**  growing like the main garden because we have little gardens all over the place too.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:25:50):**  So the main garden I think we calculated was about one seventh of an acre which you know  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:25:57):**  if you think that like most a lot of suburban lots that houses sit on or you know like a  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:26:02):**  quarter of an acre it's probably about the size of most people's backyards so it's not  
**[0:26:07-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:26:07):**  really huge.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:26:09):**  But then we do and that's where we grow most of this stuff but then for stuff like squash  
**[0:26:15-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:26:15):**  and pumpkins and winter squash like those things that just grow huge and take up tons  
**[0:26:21-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:26:21):**  of space and are also really good at storing then we have like a whole quarter acre or  
**[0:26:28-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:26:28):**  half acre that we grow of just that because just because it is so enormous and then like  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:26:38):**  we can we grow and about half of that is pumpkins that we feed to the pigs and then the other  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:26:43):**  half of it is winter squash for us which is like spaghetti squash, butternut squash, acorn  
**[0:26:48-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:26:48):**  squash which are our favorites and the cool thing about squash is that we just put them  
**[0:26:54-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:26:54):**  in the basement on wire shelves and they will last you about a year most of them some every  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:27:01):**  now and then you know you'll have one that has a spot that goes bad and you have to pitch  
**[0:27:05-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:27:05):**  it but most of them will last close to a year so I know we've we pretty much like eat squash  
**[0:27:11-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:27:11):**  12 months a year so.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:27:14):**  Yeah no those are fantastic having things that store well are such a good investment  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:27:19):**  for that garden in my experience it's like it just they keep giving and if you've got  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:27:24):**  space to keep them it's such a good go to it's like yeah you run out of anything there  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:27:29):**  those calorie density like oh well we've always got the either squash potatoes and a lot of  
**[0:27:33-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:27:33):**  things that just they keep for a really long time.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:27:39):**  I also think about like the nutritional value of stuff like everybody should be eating orange  
**[0:27:43-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:27:43):**  food on a regular basis and I don't know about other people but I find carrots hard to grow  
**[0:27:50-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:27:50):**  and a pain to harvest and whereas a butternut squash you know it's got that it's orange  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:27:57):**  it's got lots of beta carotene in it just like carrots do and it basically sorts it  
**[0:28:02-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:28:02):**  stores itself you know it's like the easiest thing in the world to grow and then you know  
**[0:28:10-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:28:10):**  you just go out there one day you pick them all and you put them someplace cool and they  
**[0:28:14-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:28:14):**  just they're fine.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:28:16):**  They're just there yeah.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:28:20):**  Okay so let's talk a little bit now about the home scale orchard.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:28:25):**  What are some preparations and things people should know when planning for something like  
**[0:28:29-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:28:29):**  an orchard?  
**[0:28:35-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:28:35):**  Again think about what you eat and also this is something that I should have thought about  
**[0:28:41-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:28:41):**  more and that is how like you probably honestly if you're only growing for yourself you probably  
**[0:28:48-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:28:48):**  only need like one apple tree and one pear tree and you know you may need to get a pollinator  
**[0:28:56-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:28:56):**  you probably need to get two of each so that you've got a pollinator for it but we planted  
**[0:29:02-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:29:02):**  way too many fruit trees.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:29:06):**  You know again I think a lot of people think this stuff is so hard because they think that  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:29:10):**  you have to have you know 40 acres and a mule and you know you have to plant 20 fruit trees  
**[0:29:15-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:29:15):**  and have dozens of animals and if you're just growing it for yourself you really don't need  
**[0:29:21-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:29:21):**  that much.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:29:23):**  Yeah no it's absolutely true I mean obviously there's some variables within that how big  
**[0:29:30-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:29:30):**  your family is or how many you know people are part of the household but yeah I mean  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:29:36):**  think about how much fruit you eat all the time and one of the things that I found really  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:29:40):**  useful that I've talked to orchardists is try and pick varieties of each thing that mature  
**[0:29:45-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:29:45):**  at different times of the year so that you don't all of a sudden end up with like eight  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:29:51):**  different trees all maturing at the same time and you could never go through that much fruit  
**[0:29:56-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:29:56):**  or you have to like process it all and freeze it or can it or whatever to make use of it.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:30:02):**  Exactly yeah because like you can get apple trees that start ripening at the end of July  
**[0:30:07-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:30:07):**  all the way through October so you know that's a really good piece of advice is to look at  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:30:14):**  you know so because you'll need to find pollinators you know like so see you know don't get two  
**[0:30:19-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:30:19):**  pollinators they're going to ripen at the same time you know try to find like try to  
**[0:30:22-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:30:22):**  find one that's going to ripen early and one that's going to ripen later so that you can  
**[0:30:27-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:30:27):**  eat more of it fresh and fresh is really good you know we initially the big thing we did  
**[0:30:33-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:30:33):**  was we made tons of jam and preserves and stuff and ultimately that winds up being a  
**[0:30:39-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:30:39):**  ton of sugar.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:30:42):**  It's so much sugar.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:30:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:30:44):**  When I first started making preserves I was blown away I was like wait there's no way  
**[0:30:48-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:30:48):**  that people have been eating this this long.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:30:50):**  Sugar's only been cheap for like the last 200 years maybe.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:30:54):**  Right.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:30:55):**  Yeah and so the big thing so think about that and then but you know like you can make applesauce  
**[0:31:02-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:31:02):**  with no sugar you can just can apples with no sugar you know and then later you can like  
**[0:31:08-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:31:08):**  put them on a salad or like just apples with like a dollop of whipped cream can be your  
**[0:31:15-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:31:15):**  dessert or something and that was one of the big mistakes we made early on and you'll see  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:31:21):**  in the book there's some recipes in there that have quite a bit of sugar in them and  
**[0:31:25-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:31:25):**  now we eat next to no sugar because it's really again we're thinking about our health and  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:31:33):**  we've just discovered that like sugar is really not good for us.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:31:38):**  So that's another thing to be careful about with fruit is thinking about how to stay away.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:31:46):**  What do you want to grow that you will do something with other that will not require

**[0:31:52-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:31:52):**  Yeah.

**[0:32:01-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:32:01):**  they're high acid enough they don't need anything else added to them.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:32:04):**  You do it in a boiling water canner and then adding fresh pear to a salad is is really

**[0:40:50-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:40:50):**  years the ratio was about 40 hens and 24 roosters.

**[0:41:09-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:41:09):**  the roosters did not like the competition for the hens they a rooster thinks he needs

**[0:41:20-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:41:20):**  my hens were literally run ragged they had no feathers on their back because the roosters

**[0:41:44-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:41:44):**  it's like well he's blind you know he can't he can't live a normal chicken life anymore  
**[0:41:49-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:41:49):**  I think that you know we should put him down which then once we got over the idea like  
**[0:41:56-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:41:56):**  okay we're gonna kill him then then it was like well you know that's good organic chicken  
**[0:42:02-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:42:02):**  I used to I know it's been 14 years but I really like chicken back when I ate it seems  
**[0:42:09-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:42:09):**  like it'd be a waste of good meat if we just killed him and buried him and so we wound  
**[0:42:14-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:42:14):**  up butchering him and you know using I had a book that talked about butchering so we  
**[0:42:20-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:42:20):**  used the book and we and the funny thing is by the time we had this big long discussion  
**[0:42:24-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:42:24):**  we went out there and he had died waiting for us to decide his fate he had died and  
**[0:42:31-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:42:31):**  so like a week later it happened again and the discussion was a little shorter this time  
**[0:42:38-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:42:38):**  but again by the time we got back out there the chicken had died and a few days later  
**[0:42:44-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:42:44):**  it happened again and that was when that was the first time we actually had to put down  
**[0:42:52-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:42:52):**  a chicken you know like that was so we had practiced butchering two chickens that were  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:42:56):**  already dead before actually having you know to chop off a head of a live one which was  
**[0:43:01-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:43:01):**  very different and then we had a really big family conversation about okay well is it  
**[0:43:07-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:43:07):**  humane to just let them kill each other and keep doing what we're doing it the way we're  
**[0:43:11-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:43:11):**  doing it because it's not it doesn't seem like a very pleasant way to go you know to  
**[0:43:18-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:43:18):**  have your eyes closed.

**[0:43:25-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:43:25):**  Exactly right yeah so we finally decided that we needed to reduce the population of rooster  
**[0:43:31-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:43:31):**  and we did and after that we were like okay we're gonna start eating you know the roosters  
**[0:43:40-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:43:40):**  when they're chicks you know well or not when they're chicks but you know like when they're  
**[0:43:42-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:43:42):**  four or five months old we're gonna we're just gonna eat them before they reach sexual  
**[0:43:45-0:43:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:43:45):**  maturity so that's what we did and then from there it was like all of a sudden like oh  
**[0:43:50-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:43:50):**  my gosh we've got too many sheep and I had never even had lamb in my life but that was  
**[0:43:57-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:43:57):**  when we decided like hmm well we don't need this much wool I think we should start butchering  
**[0:44:02-0:44:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:44:02):**  some of the weathers some of the sheep and and for years I said I could never eat a goat  
**[0:44:08-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:44:08):**  like okay I know we started eating our chickens and our sheep but I couldn't eat a goat because  
**[0:44:12-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:44:12):**  they're just too much like dogs to me and then one year we wound up with 29 bucklings.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:44:19):**  And that changed the conversation.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:44:21):**  Yeah exactly and so we wound up butchering nine of them.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/is-it-realistic-to-produce-all-your-own-food-with-deborah-niemann-author-of-homegrown-and-handmade/#t=0:44:27):**  So you know you have to you have to face some of these hard conversations sometimes and

**[0:01:10-0:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:01:10):**  of the episode, so I'll leave it for him to tell you.

**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:01:34):**  enterprise and what sorts of farms they might be best suited for.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:01:39):**  We also look into the challenges and the difficulties from growing bush and vine fruit that many  
**[0:01:44-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:01:44):**  people are still yet unaware of.

**[0:02:10-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:02:10):**  care and fertility methods that Blake has found success with in his ample experience.

**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:02:29):**  and inconveniences that cause you to lose money.

**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:03:24):**  Why don't you tell me and our audience a little bit about how you started out in farming in  
**[0:03:29-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:03:29):**  the first place?  
**[0:03:30-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:03:30):**  Sure.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:03:31):**  Thank you, Oliver.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:03:32):**  It's great to be on the podcast today.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:03:34):**  So I'm from Louisville, Kentucky.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:03:38):**  And I grew up there and I started in my horticultural pursuits when I was a little boy.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:03:47):**  I was very, very young, probably seven, eight years old.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:03:51):**  And I started growing tomatoes in a little raised bed garden that had been basically  
**[0:03:58-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:03:58):**  abandoned that was connected to my family's house.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:04:01):**  I started growing tomatoes there.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:04:03):**  And my mom would always encourage me by buying me strawberry plants or some type of neat  
**[0:04:08-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:04:08):**  seeds and they'd sometimes throw rotten cantaloupes and tomatoes into the garden and all kinds  
**[0:04:15-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:04:15):**  of crazy things would sprout and grow in it.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:04:17):**  And it was just super fascinating to me.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:04:20):**  And I started, that's where I started.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:04:23):**  And then as I became a teenager, I became more interested in it.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:04:26):**  So I started building more garden beds and making compost.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:04:31):**  I learned how to start seeds.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:04:34):**  And one of the most important things I did was I started studying books on growing organic  
**[0:04:40-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:04:40):**  vegetables and flowers and fruits.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:04:43):**  And this was before YouTube and there were not that many internet websites about this  
**[0:04:48-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:04:48):**  back then.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:04:49):**  This was like very early 2000s.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:04:52):**  And so I was just reading and reading lots of books.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:04:56):**  And that really educated me on the basic principles, like Rodale's Organic Gardening Encyclopedia  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:05:02):**  is a classic, a lot of other books I read that just really educated me.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:05:07):**  And then I would put that knowledge into action the following season.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:05:11):**  I'd spend all winter reading a stack of books that following season, I would be informed  
**[0:05:16-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:05:16):**  on so many new things and educated and I'd do it.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:05:19):**  And from there, I actually started taking care of neighborhood fruit trees that had  
**[0:05:24-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:05:24):**  been abandoned.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:05:25):**  And I would find some nice grape vines in someone's backyard.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:05:29):**  And if I knew them somewhat, I'd be like, hey, can I come and prune your grape vines  
**[0:05:33-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:05:33):**  and spray them with organic sprays?  
**[0:05:35-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:05:35):**  And I did that.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:05:36):**  And all of a sudden, in a few months, they'd be having these huge crops of fruit.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:05:41):**  So that was really interesting.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:05:43):**  And I spent some time in intentional communities for a number of years.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:05:48):**  And I would take over the community gardens that were often kind of dilapidated.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:05:53):**  And then I was scaling up.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:05:56):**  And it was all non for profit at that point.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:05:58):**  But I had my foundation set.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:06:00):**  And then I scaled up and all of a sudden, I was now doing a half acre garden.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:06:05):**  And then maybe another place I was doing a little bigger, maybe now it was like an acre  
**[0:06:08-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:06:08):**  garden.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:06:10):**  And so then I was able to learn cover cropping, and doing things on a bigger scale and using  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:06:15):**  machinery and these were all new skills I learned in my early 20s.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:06:20):**  And eventually, in 2014, I ended up starting the nursery business and an organic farm in  
**[0:06:30-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:06:30):**  Kentucky.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:06:31):**  And so that was kind of the culmination of all that preparatory work I did for over 10  
**[0:06:37-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:06:37):**  years, well over 10 years, just learning the basics and getting out there and doing it,  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:06:44):**  but also not having the pressure of, I've got to make this work financially.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:06:49):**  I was just doing it.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:06:51):**  And my financial stuff was all covered for whatever reason.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:06:54):**  I was still living at home where I was an intentional community where I wasn't worried  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:06:57):**  about bills and stuff at the time.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:07:00):**  So that was also really helpful in getting a good start and not being under pressure  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:07:04):**  to make a lot of money to pay bills to do it at the same time.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:07:08):**  Yeah, that's a fantastic trajectory.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:07:11):**  It's a really good example of something that I keep hearing as advice from other people  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:07:16):**  who've been on this show and that I've been finding for myself too is so many people are  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:07:20):**  excited about regenerative agriculture or homesteading and they want to start by buying  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:07:26):**  a piece of land and jumping in and having that learning curve from like zero to 60.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:07:31):**  But it seems like you went about it the right way of trying a few things out, studying in  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:07:35):**  the off season, doing some experiments with very low risk until you felt confidence and  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:07:40):**  capable enough to make this a bigger part of your life and take the risk then with experience  
**[0:07:46-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:07:46):**  under your belt.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:07:47):**  I can imagine, like you said, it took a lot of the pressure off of it to be a viable enterprise  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:07:52):**  right from the beginning and the things that you started off doing, you already knew how  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:07:56):**  to do quite well.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:07:58):**  Is this something that you would recommend for other people as well?  
**[0:08:00-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:08:00):**  Yeah, it's crucially important because you think about it, it's like this with any enterprise.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:08:06):**  Like you start learning a bike, you start with training wheels.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:08:09):**  You want to get good at lifting weights.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:08:11):**  You don't just go in there and start bench pressing 200 pounds day one.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:08:15):**  You start with 25 pounds and you go to 50, then you go to 75, then you go to 100, then  
**[0:08:21-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:08:21):**  you go to 125.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:08:22):**  Otherwise you're just rushing things and it's never good to rush things.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:08:28):**  I used to rush things and I made a lot of very expensive mistakes and failures both  
**[0:08:36-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:08:36):**  before I was doing it as a profession and afterwards.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:08:43):**  You have to learn the basics of things before you can go to the more advanced.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:08:49):**  It's like this with gardening, it's like this with farming.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:08:52):**  You have to understand, just because you want something to work and you have a dream and  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:08:57):**  a passion doesn't mean it's going to actually work in reality.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:09:03):**  We have to be real about this.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:09:06):**  I do believe in positive thinking and optimism and all these things, but you also have to  
**[0:09:12-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:09:12):**  be realistic that working with the earth is a very, very, very dynamic system and there's  
**[0:09:18-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:09:18):**  so many factors out of your control.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:09:20):**  If you don't understand how to prepare for those and manage all those factors, then things  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:09:26):**  can sometimes clash together and cause a lot of challenges.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:09:32):**  You may not be prepared for and if you're depending on this for a source of income,  
**[0:09:38-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:09:38):**  then you absolutely have to be trained.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:09:40):**  It's just like going to school or college before you start a career.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:09:44):**  Gardening and farming is no different.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:09:46):**  You have to start with the basics.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:09:47):**  You should educate yourself, be mentored, practice on a small scale and then scale up.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:09:53):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:09:54):**  Let's dive deep into how things started to go once you did move on to your own land and  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:09:59):**  start your farm.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:10:01):**  This culminated into the book that we're going to explore even further in this interview  
**[0:10:06-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:10:06):**  on growing small fruit, growing berries.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:10:09):**  Was that the first enterprise that you launched when you got onto your land or is this something  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:10:13):**  that developed after you'd already tried out a few other things?  
**[0:10:17-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:10:17):**  Yeah, so when I got on the land and decided to start this farm with my wife, we knew that  
**[0:10:26-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:10:26):**  right away that the most profitable route short term was going to be intense vegetable  
**[0:10:37-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:10:37):**  production period because they just produce so fast and they're always in demand and Kentucky's  
**[0:10:43-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:10:43):**  a really, really good place to grow vegetables and not such a good place to grow fruit and  
**[0:10:50-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:10:50):**  we'll go into that a little bit later.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:10:53):**  We started out with a CSA operation, very small.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:10:58):**  I had maybe 15 people in the CSA or something.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:11:02):**  We were also doing a farmer's market in a small town farmer's market.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:11:06):**  This is not a big bustling city, thousand, 2,000 customer farmer's market, very small.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:11:14):**  We started a home delivery service which turned out to be a great option for us in our area.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:11:20):**  We also were selling to a local health food store and in addition to the vegetable production,  
**[0:11:25-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:11:25):**  I started putting in some small fruits.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:11:28):**  Those were blackberries, red raspberries and figs in addition to some various tree fruits.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:11:36):**  At the same time as I was doing all this, we were also developing this small scale nursery  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:11:42):**  operation with the intention that the nursery operation would eventually become the main  
**[0:11:48-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:11:48):**  business which it ended up becoming that and we actually don't even grow vegetables anymore  
**[0:11:54-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:11:54):**  for sale.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:11:57):**  In that trial that we did with the small fruits, we learned a lot about marketing and the profitability  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:12:05):**  of various fruits and I had been cultivating small fruits at that point.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:12:10):**  That was when I was 29 years old or so.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:12:14):**  I'd been doing it for well over 10 years at this point.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:12:17):**  I had 10 years of on the ground experience under my belt and knowledge and everything  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:12:23):**  and doing it in various regions across the US.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:12:27):**  I didn't go into it with a year of practice or no practice at all but that's how we got  
**[0:12:34-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:12:34):**  started with the business and the small fruits.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:12:37):**  It sounds like you were very strategic about this from the beginning.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:12:41):**  You know you needed cash flow and approached that from the market garden so that you can  
**[0:12:47-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:12:47):**  get some income moving through.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:12:50):**  I would imagine it's going to take a little while, a couple of years in a lot of cases  
**[0:12:54-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:12:54):**  for the small fruit and of course even more for orchards to start to produce.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:13:01):**  It sounds like you started to test and introduce the small fruit through that CSA in order  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:13:07):**  to determine whether to expand it or did you already have a layout or a design for your  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:13:11):**  farm by the time you started planting those?  
**[0:13:16-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:13:16):**  We had created a layout for the farm and whenever I would do the planning for each season for  
**[0:13:24-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:13:24):**  what I was going to sell and what I was going to plant, I worked on it for probably 30 hours  
**[0:13:31-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:13:31):**  before the season even started.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:13:33):**  This was a very, very well organized operation and when we first started, we were probably  
**[0:13:40-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:13:40):**  the lowest grossing market table at the farmers market when we first started because we actually  
**[0:13:47-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:13:47):**  started the season very late.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:13:48):**  It was like August or September when we started.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:13:51):**  By the time we stopped doing the farmers market, we were probably the highest grossing people  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:13:57):**  there as far as table sales, not including CSAs and everything.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:14:02):**  It was very well organized and we did go about it in a structured manner.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:14:11):**  As we went along, we saw that red raspberries were actually a very strategic item and I  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:14:18):**  actually put those on the cover of the book for a reason because I consider those one  
**[0:14:22-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:14:22):**  of the very best small fruits any grower can get into.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:14:25):**  You mentioned the time factor there.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:14:28):**  Sure, most tree fruits you're looking at three to five years before you even start getting  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:14:33):**  yields let alone marketable size yields.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:14:37):**  That's one thing that I advocate for around growing small fruits is the yields can come  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:14:41):**  in very rapidly compared to other fruits like for instance red raspberries.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:14:46):**  They can start producing fruit within six months of planting from roots, not even plants,  
**[0:14:52-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:14:52):**  just the roots.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:14:53):**  This is in stark contrast to say pears that you're looking at four, five, six years to  
**[0:14:59-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:14:59):**  production and copious yields can get produced from these small fruits and they just seem  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:15:06):**  to be always in demand and easier to grow.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:15:09):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:15:10):**  Let's dig into the pros and cons of small fruit.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:15:15):**  Obviously there's a huge range of them so we can go through some of at least the major  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:15:18):**  categories but what have been some of the things that you've identified that need to  
**[0:15:23-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:15:23):**  be considered that are drawbacks from going right into this and what are some of the real  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:15:27):**  advantages that make this attractive?  
**[0:15:31-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:15:31):**  It just really depends on what your goals are because if you're the type of person that  
**[0:15:38-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:15:38):**  you have some sort of career or job and you want to turn your backyard, you have a large  
**[0:15:45-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:15:45):**  backyard and you want to turn it into fruit production to make some extra money and do  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:15:48):**  something interesting in life, small fruits are the way to go.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:15:53):**  They're probably your best option unless you're going to do vegetables or some other type  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:15:59):**  of growing but if you want to do fruits, small fruits are a great way to go.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:16:04):**  If you already have an existing farm operation like let's say you already have a CSA operation,  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:16:10):**  you're wanting to diversify and get into fruits, small fruits are probably the best option  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:16:15):**  for you again just because they fit right into all that so easily.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:16:20):**  Now if you're wanting to start a farm from scratch to make your full income, I really  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:16:27):**  am echoing what a lot of other people out there are going to say and that's don't quit  
**[0:16:31-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:16:31):**  your day job just yet and just get it established and you have to see how things go with it.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:16:41):**  So you don't want to just jump right in and hope that it works out but yeah, the small  
**[0:16:47-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:16:47):**  fruits can be a great option for the micro grower, the urban grower and someone who's  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:16:54):**  got an organic farm that's looking to diversify and get into something that's going to be  
**[0:16:59-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:16:59):**  relatively low input, valuable and in demand to enhance their existing farm table or their  
**[0:17:06-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:17:06):**  CSA.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:17:07):**  I'm really glad that we're going into this specifically because small fruit, berries  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:17:11):**  in general but vines is also something that you profile in the book, seems like the perfect  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:17:17):**  middle ground in the transition between what I hear a lot of people wanting, right?  
**[0:17:22-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:17:22):**  There's less of the I guess just time investment that is required for let's say a high turnover  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:17:30):**  veggie garden and everything that goes in with annual production but there isn't the  
**[0:17:34-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:17:34):**  lag time and I guess some of the other drawbacks of going into tree crop production much like  
**[0:17:41-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:17:41):**  you talked about already.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:17:42):**  It fits this nice little middle ground where you can get pretty high turnover.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:17:46):**  They are perennial and so there's a lot of maintenance in there that you can avoid or  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:17:51):**  minimize and whether you're going to stay at a market garden size or invest in some  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:17:57):**  of the bigger plant infrastructure like trees and maybe even nut crops at some point, this  
**[0:18:01-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:18:01):**  can help you make that transition and can maintain a place even in a mature system by  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:18:09):**  making use of some of the trophic layers of an agroforestry system or food forest like  
**[0:18:14-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:18:14):**  is so popular right now for extra yield and potentially pretty lucrative income.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:18:22):**  And so where do you see this fitting in not only in what you've experienced for your own  
**[0:18:27-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:18:27):**  farm but for the various different agroforestry configurations and ambitions let's say from  
**[0:18:34-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:18:34):**  garden size to larger farm size when it comes to its place in the business?  
**[0:18:41-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:18:41):**  Sure.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:18:42):**  Yeah, it can be an excellent choice for everything you just said and yeah so in the early 2000s  
**[0:18:48-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:18:48):**  I built this urban agroforestry food forest in Louisville, Kentucky.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:18:55):**  It's a very mature system now and I really learned a lot about the sequence of events  
**[0:18:59-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:18:59):**  that happens when you're doing this and of course food forest or a whole other topic  
**[0:19:06-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:19:06):**  but what I can say is that berries are naturally a part of the sequence of a grassland turning  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:19:16):**  into a forest and what I learned along the way and through observation is that berries  
**[0:19:21-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:19:21):**  are actually like a natural form of barbed wire which keep out browsing animals especially  
**[0:19:28-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:19:28):**  deer and keep them away from trees and so this allows the trees to be protected from  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:19:36):**  deer rubbing them or browsing on them and they will eventually grow to the point of  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:19:41):**  then shading out and killing out the berries and making a more mature forest ecosystem.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:19:47):**  And so that being said in between rows of fruit trees in order to produce income and  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:19:54):**  a product years before the fruits themselves mature, berries are a great choice and you  
**[0:19:59-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:19:59):**  can do black raspberries, red raspberries, blackberries, other things, etc.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:20:05):**  I wouldn't recommend blueberries because they're like a long-term shrub.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:20:10):**  They can live for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:20:14):**  You know they usually start to peter out after 8 or 10 years or so but they're a great option  
**[0:20:21-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:20:21):**  to bring in production in an orchard system fast or a food forest system fast while the  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:20:28):**  trees have time to mature so they do fit into that very well.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:20:33):**  So I see all of the benefits and I mean to me it's very clear in my understanding of  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:20:37):**  ecology so the benefits of small fruit and berries in the succession of an ecosystem  
**[0:20:42-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:20:42):**  and the roles that it plays in creating the conditions for other plants to thrive as well  
**[0:20:48-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:20:48):**  is very clear.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:20:50):**  But there are some challenges associated with this too.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:20:53):**  It's not all easygoing despite the quicker turnover, the established markets for these  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:20:57):**  fruits, there are some challenges in managing them.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:21:01):**  Can we go over some of those?  
**[0:21:02-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:21:02):**  Sure.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:21:03):**  So yeah, management is something that I think is one of the major skills that's lacking  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:21:13):**  with fruit production that I've seen on the non-professional level.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:21:19):**  So the guys that are the pros that are growing the berries for the grocery stores, they've  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:21:26):**  got it all down whether it's organic or not.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:21:31):**  But the small scale growers and the people that are out there that I'm sure listen to  
**[0:21:37-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:21:37):**  your podcast that are like wanting to do community gardens or backyard production or some sort  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:21:43):**  of urban thing or nonprofit thing, I've seen this all over the United States and even other  
**[0:21:48-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:21:48):**  parts of the world that people don't really understand the basics of growing and managing  
**[0:21:55-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:21:55):**  fruit crops.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:21:57):**  Fills seem to be a little easier and a little faster to handle.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:22:03):**  You just dig up the soil, add a bunch of compost, plant some squash seeds and bam, you got zucchinis.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:22:10):**  But fruit production is just different and it's an art and it takes a lot of diligence

**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:22:28):**  whatever you find online that sounds good.

**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:22:40):**  and that's something that I cover in detail in the book because I feel like it's such  
**[0:22:44-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:22:44):**  an important topic that often gets overlooked.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:22:46):**  A lot of information out there tells you, you plant this type of fruit and you do a  
**[0:22:53-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:22:53):**  little this and a little that and there it is.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:22:56):**  But there's a lot of other information out there such as exact variety selection, training,  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:23:04):**  so on and so forth that's not so easily found and is often overlooked.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:23:10):**  I've seen a lot more dilapidated fruit trees and berry plantings that I've seen ones that  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:23:17):**  I thought, wow, this is really well maintained and really productive outside of a commercial

**[0:23:23-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:23:23):**  I've seen a lot more that I look at and I can tell, wow, this either got neglected a  
**[0:23:29-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:23:29):**  long time ago or the person that did it really didn't know what they were doing and it's  
**[0:23:36-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:23:36):**  not going so great.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:23:39):**  That being said, you really have to learn and dedicate to the fundamental basics of  
**[0:23:48-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:23:48):**  growing different fruits and it varies depending on what type of fruit it is.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:23:51):**  For instance, in the agroforest system, if you just plant a lot of berries or in an orchard  
**[0:23:58-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:23:58):**  system, if you just plant a lot of berries in between say rows of apple trees, well,  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:24:06):**  you've created a dynamic now that you now have to deal with because first of all, there's  
**[0:24:11-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:24:11):**  going to be weeds and weed trees that will grow in between the berries and if those aren't  
**[0:24:17-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:24:17):**  managed, they're going to take it over.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:24:19):**  Now it's not just grass in between the trees so you can't just go through with a mower  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:24:24):**  and mow it all down and say, okay, it looks great.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:24:27):**  There's no weeds.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:24:29):**  Now you've created a situation that you're either going to know how to manage or you're  
**[0:24:34-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:24:34):**  not and it's either going to become a productive part of the system or it's going to become  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:24:39):**  a weedy mess that you're going to then say, okay, it's better if we just bush hog all  
**[0:24:44-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:24:44):**  this down and start over or just get rid of it so that's one of those dynamic factors  
**[0:24:51-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:24:51):**  I'm talking about with when you're working with fruit trees and you're working with fruiting  
**[0:24:55-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:24:55):**  plants, you might think it's going to look a certain way but then it turns out a different  
**[0:25:01-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:25:01):**  way because there's all these other dynamic factors that come into play.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:25:04):**  For instance, you have to have plans for weed control and weed management and grass control  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:25:11):**  and grass management and how are you going to handle that?  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:25:15):**  Are you going to handle that with synthetic mulch like black landscape fabric?  
**[0:25:19-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:25:19):**  You're going to handle it with organic mulch, cardboard, weed string trimmers, what are  
**[0:25:26-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:25:26):**  you going to do and is it practical and is it going to actually work?  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:25:33):**  That's something that I talk about in the book as well and it's a really important factor.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:25:39):**  In general, it's going to be easier to manage fruit when it's not mixed in with everything  
**[0:25:49-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:25:49):**  else and I know that goes against a lot of permaculture idealism of having everything  
**[0:25:56-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:25:56):**  sort of mixed together but if you're really wanting to have something be very, very productive  
**[0:26:02-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:26:02):**  for marketing purposes, you're going to want to grow it in blocks or rows generally speaking.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:26:08):**  If you look at any successful CSA operation or organic farm operation that's really successful  
**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:26:15):**  what they're doing, 99% of the time that's going to be how it is.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:26:20):**  You're going to have here's our row of carrots, here's our row of tomatoes, here's our row  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:26:24):**  of lettuce, here's our row of salad mix.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:26:28):**  Here's one lettuce plant and here's one tomato plant and there's a few carrots under it and  
**[0:26:33-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:26:33):**  there's an onion and then there's a few zucchinis.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:26:36):**  That's fine in a backyard situation but on a farming situation, it's just so much more  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:26:41):**  practical and efficient to have everything kind of blocked together.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:26:45):**  Now, I'm not saying that it should be a monoculture of nothing but raspberries for an acre but  
**[0:26:53-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:26:53):**  you can have it in a 100-foot row of raspberries, a 100-foot row of blackberries, a 100-foot  
**[0:26:59-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:26:59):**  row of strawberries, etc.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:27:01):**  But it's generally just so much easier to manage it, harvest it, prune it, whatever  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:27:07):**  when they are in an organized fashion like that.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:27:11):**  It just is the best way to do it.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:27:14):**  And so, these are all factors that you have to consider.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:27:18):**  I'm really glad you mentioned this because this is something that I always struggle to  
**[0:27:21-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:27:21):**  explain as you know there's this increased interest in things like centropic agroforestry,  
**[0:27:28-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:27:28):**  blue forests and such which advocate for very dynamic and diverse ecosystems in which everything  
**[0:27:34-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:27:34):**  is interplanted together.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:27:35):**  You've got all of the different strata of a forest right on top of each other trying  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:27:39):**  to make the most of the synthetic or photosynthetic potential of an area.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:27:44):**  But just like you mentioned, it totally depends on the context.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:27:46):**  If that's your backyard and you're not trying to do this as a major enterprise that you're  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:27:51):**  earning money from, yeah, that can make a lot of sense as well as the potential maybe  
**[0:27:56-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:27:56):**  if you're trying to get a U-pick configuration or enterprise off the ground where people  
**[0:28:02-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:28:02):**  like the diversity and there's something different in season at different times and it's much  
**[0:28:06-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:28:06):**  more experience based.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:28:08):**  But just like you stressed, if you are trying to effectively get through a harvest season  
**[0:28:13-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:28:13):**  and a maintenance schedule on something that you're going to be picking and marketing yourself,  
**[0:28:19-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:28:19):**  man, you've invited a lot of problems into your system if you've got everything stacked  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:28:24):**  on top of itself and limiting the ways that you can access things because like you said,  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:28:29):**  I mean, berry bushes, a lot of them are like barbed wire and getting through them is an  
**[0:28:34-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:28:34):**  absolute nightmare if you've got to access trees, if you've got to get a mower through  
**[0:28:38-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:28:38):**  there and it's great to have that as a consideration before you go out and start planting.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:28:44):**  Now, with that in mind, all of these different fruits have their own maintenance schedules,  
**[0:28:51-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:28:51):**  the care that they need for the soil, pruning, propagation, fertility, all of those things  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:28:57):**  and you outline quite a range of them in your book.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:29:02):**  Do you want to go through either as categories of fruit and talk about the maintenance and  
**[0:29:06-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:29:06):**  soil health considerations or is it better to take things by cultivar and go through  
**[0:29:12-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:29:12):**  them individually?  
**[0:29:14-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:29:14):**  So about the agroforestry, maybe you know how to pronounce his name better than I do,  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:29:22):**  Stefan...  
**[0:29:23-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:29:23):**  Subkowiak.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:29:24):**  Subkowiak.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:29:25):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:29:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:29:27):**  Okay, so I just want to mention him.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:29:31):**  So as far as agroforestry goes in a temperate sense, I think that a lot of people are confusing  
**[0:29:39-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:29:39):**  tropical agroforestry with temperate agroforestry because they're two completely different things.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:29:46):**  And if we look at the original agroforestry models that were put forth in old permaculture  
**[0:29:53-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:29:53):**  books that got everybody kind of turned on to this concept, they're based on tropical  
**[0:29:59-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:29:59):**  and subtropical growing.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:30:01):**  And in the temperate zones, things just work differently.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:30:04):**  And I think that Stefan Subkowiak in Canada and in Quebec, he has it down better than  
**[0:30:13-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:30:13):**  most that I've seen in terms of blending agroforestry with traditional orcharding and making a really  
**[0:30:20-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:30:20):**  functional system that works.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:30:22):**  And his model is kind of like a you pick crossed with harvesting loads of apples and pears  
**[0:30:31-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:30:31):**  and selling them however he sells them on his own.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:30:35):**  And so that model works really good.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:30:36):**  And he does have things kind of mixed in there.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:30:38):**  It's also Canada, where things grow a lot less crazy than they grow in Kentucky.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:30:45):**  You know, here in Kentucky, we have weeds that will get eight feet tall, 10 feet tall  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:30:49):**  in a season from seed.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:30:53):**  And so it's just different growing conditions.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:30:55):**  So you have to understand your region and what it can handle and not try to replicate  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:31:01):**  something that you read about in a book or saw on a video, especially in a region or  
**[0:31:06-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:31:06):**  climate zone that's completely different than yours.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:31:09):**  So that's all an important factor.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:31:10):**  And we just have to be not too idealistic.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:31:14):**  You know, I advocate people experiment and try new things, but you want to do that on  
**[0:31:18-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:31:18):**  a small scale first to see if it actually works.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:31:20):**  Well, before we jump to the next question, can you clarify a little bit some of the major  
**[0:31:25-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:31:25):**  differences between tropical, subtropical and temperate agroforestry configurations or  
**[0:31:32-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:31:32):**  enterprises?  
**[0:31:33-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:31:33):**  What are some of the main considerations that differentiate them?  
**[0:31:36-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:31:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:31:37):**  So from what I've seen, you know, I spent over a year in Hawaii learning tropical agriculture  
**[0:31:44-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:31:44):**  and permaculture in Hawaii.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:31:46):**  And I saw these incredibly impressive systems there with just towering fruit trees, you  
**[0:31:53-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:31:53):**  know, 50, 60, 70 foot tall jackfruit and pedolai and mangoes and coconuts.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:32:03):**  And I mean, it's just incredible durians and all this stuff.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:32:08):**  And there's something about fruit trees in the tropics.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:32:12):**  They can handle a little bit more shade and they can also handle higher humidity and moisture.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:32:20):**  And so, and there's a lot of understory species in the tropics that can handle shade and handle  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:32:26):**  super high humidity and still make good crops and still thrive.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:32:31):**  And in the temperate zone, we have a lot less diversity to choose from.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:32:38):**  And plants are, most fruiting plants are much more sensitive to high humidity and shade  
**[0:32:42-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:32:42):**  here.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:32:43):**  And so if you plant fruit trees too close together, they're going to start shading each  
**[0:32:47-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:32:47):**  other out, which is going to make the lower branches eventually defoliate and dry up and  
**[0:32:52-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:32:52):**  die.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:32:53):**  And it's going to make the trees lanky and unproductive.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:32:57):**  There's not that many fruits that can grow in the shade.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:33:00):**  I can only think of two and that would be pawpaws and black raspberry, both of which  
**[0:33:06-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:33:06):**  are going to have much diminished crops in the shade.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:33:10):**  There's also some other things.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:33:12):**  I'm sorry?  
**[0:33:13-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:33:13):**  Would you consider gooseberry one of those shade tolerant ones?  
**[0:33:18-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:33:18):**  Gooseberry can handle some shade also, also currents.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:33:21):**  That's a good point.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:33:22):**  Those are two that can handle a little bit more shade.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:33:25):**  And in some situations like in Kentucky, they actually need to be grown in a partially shaded  
**[0:33:29-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:33:29):**  location because it's so hot here.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:33:31):**  In cooler locations, they can be grown in full sun.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:33:34):**  However, once again, the crops are going to be reduced when they're grown in the shade.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:33:40):**  And so that's a big factor.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:33:41):**  And a lot of plants also are going to get a lot of fungal diseases like powdery mildew  
**[0:33:48-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:33:48):**  and things like that when they're grown in a partially shaded location.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:33:52):**  And so fruit trees in the temperate locations and berries, they need as much sun as possible.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:33:59):**  And if you start cramming everything together and trying to layer it, eventually what's  
**[0:34:03-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:34:03):**  going to happen is the lower story stuff is usually going to start to go into decline  
**[0:34:11-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:34:11):**  and the trees are going to eventually take over.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:34:13):**  And the biggest trees, like say nut trees, are going to shade out the fruit trees if  
**[0:34:18-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:34:18):**  you don't configure it properly and then make those die out or go into decline as well.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:34:24):**  And I learned this firsthand from observing an agroforest that I built over 20 years ago.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:34:31):**  That's in a lot of ways, that's exactly what's happened.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:34:35):**  And so I advocate for more learning at least the basics of traditional orcharding first  
**[0:34:44-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:34:44):**  and then put those practices into agroforestry if you want to go that route.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:34:48):**  Whereas a lot of people want to jump right into something that sounds exciting and radical  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:34:53):**  and innovative without learning the basics first.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:34:58):**  And I just don't advocate that approach.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:35:01):**  People can do whatever they want, but I advocate learning the basics and the fundamentals first  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:35:05):**  and then experimenting in your region to see what might work and what might not.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:35:10):**  Yeah, that sounds like the correct order of things for sure.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:35:14):**  And just to be specific, where do you make that cutoff between temperate, subtropical  
**[0:35:18-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:35:18):**  and tropical?  
**[0:35:20-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:35:20):**  What hardiness zones are we talking about here so people have reference at home?  
**[0:35:24-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:35:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:35:25):**  So basically from all the research I've done, tropical means anything above about 40 degrees  
**[0:35:34-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:35:34):**  or so that never goes below 40 degrees.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:35:37):**  Ultratropical means it never goes below 50 degrees.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:35:41):**  Subtropical means it never really goes below 32 degrees.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:35:45):**  And then temperate is anything that goes below 32 degrees or colder.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:35:49):**  And so USDA zones, I think what is zone 10, the edge of the tropics?  
**[0:35:55-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:35:55):**  Yeah, I mean, so I'm trying to think about what we have here, right?  
**[0:35:59-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:35:59):**  In Spain, so around Barcelona and in Southern Spain, as well as some of the Northern coast,  
**[0:36:06-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:36:06):**  because it's close to the ocean, you'll get zone 10A.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:36:09):**  I don't think we have much zone 10B here except maybe some of the islands off in the Atlantic.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:36:16):**  Where I am right now is 9A and we definitely get a few below freezing nights or weeks in  
**[0:36:21-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:36:21):**  the winter.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:36:22):**  So I think we're right on that edge.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:36:24):**  I think our area is considered subtropical and people often get that wrong.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:36:29):**  Tropical is actually the more tropical climate and subtropical, even though it sounds like  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:36:33):**  it's below tropical, is actually the cooler of those two configurations.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:36:38):**  So we're on that edge and where I'm moving to is a bit colder.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:36:41):**  And so that's probably temperate.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:36:43):**  We're looking at zone 7B8A there and it definitely gets minus 10 Celsius, which is what, like  
**[0:36:53-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:36:53):**  in the 20s, maybe as low as 15 degrees.  
**[0:36:55-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:36:55):**  No, 15 degrees is a little bit colder, perfect Fahrenheit.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:36:59):**  So yeah, hopefully that gives people some references to the areas that we're talking  
**[0:37:02-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:37:02):**  about and how they're classified based on frost zones.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:37:06):**  Yeah, so just to clarify, zone 10 is 30 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:37:15):**  Zone 11 is 40 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:37:19):**  And so basically 10B is where the subtropics temperatures would start.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:37:26):**  Zone 11 would be tropical.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:37:29):**  Zone 12 and 13 would be getting into ultra tropical.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:37:32):**  Okay, so I didn't realize that subtropical band was so thin.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:37:37):**  That's just like a one hardiness degree zone.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:37:40):**  I thought it was a little bit wider than that.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:37:42):**  So yeah, it's definitely temperate when you get into 9 and below.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:37:45):**  That's good to know.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:37:47):**  Okay, so we've established those differences and some of the major considerations, mostly  
**[0:37:51-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:37:51):**  being access to sunlight and prevention of humidity for productivity of these cultivars.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:37:58):**  Let's go now into some more details about the maintenance considerations, right?  
**[0:38:04-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:38:04):**  Like you said, very few people get this right.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:38:07):**  Taking care of the fertility, the pruning, the general maintenance of soft fruit and  
**[0:38:13-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:38:13):**  berries.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:38:14):**  Are there patterns that are broadly applied to the range of species that we're talking  
**[0:38:19-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:38:19):**  about here?  
**[0:38:20-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:38:20):**  Or is it very specific to the cultivar?  
**[0:38:23-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:38:23):**  Well, there are specifics to species.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:38:27):**  You know, for instance, blueberries are only going to succeed in acidic soil pH.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:38:34):**  Whereas other fruits, most other fruits are going to be better at pH that are more alkaline.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:38:41):**  And so that's like a basic factor.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:38:44):**  As far as fertility goes, most fruits do best with fairly high fertility.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:38:50):**  They're heavily producing.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:38:51):**  They produce a lot of foliage, a lot of stems, a lot of canes, a lot of fruits, a lot of  
**[0:38:56-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:38:56):**  seeds.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:38:57):**  All those things require high fertility.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:39:01):**  Soil type can be variable.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:39:04):**  There's small fruits that can do well in clay soil, sandy soil, loamy soil, rocky soil.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:39:11):**  There's some that can do good in all those types of soil.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:39:14):**  For instance, blackberries, they can thrive in sand, they can thrive in clay, they can  
**[0:39:19-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:39:19):**  thrive in loam, rocky soil, etc.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:39:24):**  Now there's certain fundamentals to how you deal with your soil type that are going to  
**[0:39:32-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:39:32):**  make the operation go better or worse.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:39:36):**  And so basically anything you can do to increase organic matter in the soil is going to be  
**[0:39:43-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:39:43):**  a huge plus.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:39:45):**  So if you're able to do cover cropping on the site beforehand, it's going to pay a lot  
**[0:39:51-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:39:51):**  of dividends in the future in soil health, moisture retention, microorganism level, organic  
**[0:39:58-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:39:58):**  matter percentage.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:40:00):**  And all these things are very, very important to growing healthy crops that don't rely on  
**[0:40:06-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:40:06):**  a lot of inputs including irrigation.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:40:12):**  And so there's things that you need to take into consideration and you can only do those  
**[0:40:16-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:40:16):**  things if you understand your site well.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:40:18):**  So if you're brand new to your site, you're going to want to spend some time studying  
**[0:40:22-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:40:22):**  it, studying the region.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:40:25):**  There's actually a great tool here that a lot of your listeners are going to be very

**[0:40:33-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:40:33):**  And this is a USDA website and it's https://ps-web-soil-survey-in-rcs.usda.gov.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:40:50):**  And this is an incredible tool that is a little awkward to use like most government websites.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:40:58):**  It's a little awkward to use at first.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:41:00):**  As soon as the website opens, there's this green button that says start WSS.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:41:05):**  You click that button and then this map pops up and you have to – I can't go into exactly  
**[0:41:13-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:41:13):**  how to use the website just now.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:41:15):**  It's fairly intuitive.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:41:16):**  You should be able to figure it out.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:41:19):**  But you can look up anywhere in the United States.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:41:23):**  It may go beyond the United States.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:41:24):**  It may just be United States.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:41:26):**  I'm not 100% sure.

**[0:42:30-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:42:30):**  Which you should really know that anyway.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:42:32):**  But they can tell you exactly what type of soil type you have.

**[0:42:39-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:42:39):**  cover crops as well as cultivars of fruit which is an incredibly important thing to  
**[0:42:49-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:42:49):**  know before you get into this.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:42:51):**  Not only okay I want to grow strawberries and raspberries and blueberries but what varieties,  
**[0:42:56-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:42:56):**  what aka cultivars are going to be appropriate for my region?  
**[0:43:03-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:43:03):**  And so going to your local ag extension office or agricultural offices in your country can  
**[0:43:09-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:43:09):**  be a great starting point to learn what do they recommend.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:43:13):**  And it may not be what you finalize on but it can at least be a great starting point.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:43:17):**  Yeah, why not use those resources?  
**[0:43:20-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:43:20):**  The US has some great extension services like you mentioned and a lot of web services as  
**[0:43:26-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:43:26):**  well.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:43:27):**  I've been starting to find out about the ones that exist here in Spain.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:43:31):**  There are some equivalent things.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:43:32):**  I found those soil maps with the coded function and I don't know about an extension service.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:43:38):**  I think that might not exist but it's worth digging into these and getting as much information  
**[0:43:43-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:43:43):**  as you can from existing sources before you go into trying to figure all that out yourself.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:43:48):**  And like you said it can give you a really good head start without having to do too much  
**[0:43:53-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:43:53):**  guesswork.  
**[0:43:55-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:43:55):**  And to reference Stefan Subkoiak like he did earlier, he talks about trying to grow things  
**[0:44:00-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:44:00):**  that grow like weeds rather than the ones that you basically need to prop up on life  
**[0:44:04-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:44:04):**  support in order to get a yield off of.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:44:07):**  It's so much better to start with the things that do well in the natural conditions that  
**[0:44:11-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:44:11):**  you have instead of trying to make these baby sort of coddled conditions for something that  
**[0:44:17-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:44:17):**  you're always going to struggle to keep alive.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:44:19):**  That's definitely the place you want to start.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:44:22):**  And that's going to really vary depending on what region you're in.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:44:25):**  Like for instance in the southern US like places like Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana,  
**[0:44:33-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:44:33):**  blueberries grow like weeds and will get copious yields of great quality fruit with very little  
**[0:44:41-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:44:41):**  care and input.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:44:43):**  Muscadine grapes grow like weeds.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:44:46):**  There's other things.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:44:47):**  But here where we're at in sort of the central part of the country, I can't get blueberries  
**[0:44:53-0:44:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:44:53):**  to even survive.  
**[0:44:56-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:44:56):**  And muscadine grapes are something you have to really coddle to get them to make it here  
**[0:45:01-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:45:01):**  because of the cold weather we experienced.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:45:04):**  Whereas black raspberries grow like weeds.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:45:08):**  Blackberries grow like weeds.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:45:10):**  There's a lot of other fruits that just do great with very little care.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:45:14):**  And whereas you go 12 hours north of here and it may be something totally different.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:45:19):**  So it just the regions that you're in is going to have its own specifics and it's going to  
**[0:45:25-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:45:25):**  vary from place to place.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:45:27):**  It may even vary at your site from 10 miles away due to various factors.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:45:34):**  Is proximity to water bodies.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:45:37):**  Are you in a valley?  
**[0:45:38-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:45:38):**  Are you in a mountainous area?  
**[0:45:40-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:45:40):**  Are you on the leeward side of the mountain or the windward side of the mountain?  
**[0:45:44-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:45:44):**  There's so many different factors that you have to really understand.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:45:48):**  And that's where what you envision and what idealistically you want to do might have to  
**[0:45:54-0:46:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:45:54):**  shift over time to be acclimated to your specific site.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:46:00):**  Yeah, that's great advice.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:46:01):**  And that's also why I always tell people to manage their expectations before they figure  
**[0:46:06-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:46:06):**  out where they're going to be doing it and let your landscape tell you what it wants  
**[0:46:10-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:46:10):**  to be rather than the other way around.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:46:12):**  Because fighting the natural conditions is not a recipe for success.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:46:17):**  Whereas a lot of potential can reveal itself to you if you do the legwork to learn about  
**[0:46:23-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:46:23):**  the particularities of the land that you're working on and what is going to do there well  
**[0:46:28-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:46:28):**  there naturally.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:46:30):**  And so with all of the research that you've done and the experience that you've amassed  
**[0:46:35-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:46:35):**  in the different experiments and gardens that you started as well as your own experience  
**[0:46:39-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:46:39):**  in farming, you mentioned that you had resources in the beginning like the Rodale's guide to  
**[0:46:47-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:46:47):**  organic farming.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:46:48):**  I'm sure you've looked into different sprays and fertilizers.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:46:53):**  In this regard, are there any things that really stand out as this was a light bulb  
**[0:46:58-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:46:58):**  moment for me, this made a real difference?  
**[0:47:02-0:47:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:47:02):**  Obviously there are specifics within cultivars like we've already talked about, but are there  
**[0:47:06-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:47:06):**  pieces of advice or tools or bioinoculants, fertilizers that you found work very broadly  
**[0:47:13-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:47:13):**  and a good place to start?  
**[0:47:17-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:47:17):**  One thing that really stands out, I can sum up in two words, deer fencing.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:47:26):**  Here in Kentucky and a lot of parts of the Eastern US especially, deer are just rampant  
**[0:47:34-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:47:34):**  and the wildlife population in the US keeps increasing because there's no longer much  
**[0:47:42-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:47:42):**  of a fur trade.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:47:45):**  Fing has probably decreased a little bit too and as urban centers extend out into rural  
**[0:47:54-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:47:54):**  areas, they're clashing with wildlife.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:47:59):**  One of the biggest issues that we have is just wildlife, possums, raccoons, deer, squirrels  
**[0:48:06-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:48:06):**  can be a huge issue.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:48:08):**  They're not so bad here, but they can be a huge issue.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:48:11):**  Any type of animal protection that you can do is just vitally important.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:48:18):**  Seven, eight foot tall deer fencing can be extremely useful.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:48:24):**  There's actually nowadays there's high quality mesh deer fencing that is made out of nylon  
**[0:48:31-0:48:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:48:31):**  type ropes that are knotted together.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:48:36):**  That can be a very inexpensive option.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:48:38):**  I went with the very expensive industrial type, huge posts, high tensile wire type of  
**[0:48:46-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:48:46):**  fence and I don't regret that.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:48:48):**  But if you have a smaller operation or you're a backyard grower, nylon deer fencing can  
**[0:48:55-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:48:55):**  be a good option.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:48:57):**  Much much cheaper and faster to put up.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:49:01):**  Also different types of bird netting can be really effective and useful.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:49:05):**  There's a lot of options out there for dealing with pests and diseases and animals that are  
**[0:49:12-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:49:12):**  very innovative.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:49:14):**  One thing I mentioned in the book is that at this point in time, pretty much any sort  
**[0:49:20-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:49:20):**  of challenge that you have from fertility to pest protection to disease prevention,  
**[0:49:29-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:49:29):**  any of those things can be dealt with organically at this point.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:49:34):**  That wasn't the case 20, 30, 40 years ago where you look at these little books and it's  
**[0:49:39-0:49:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:49:39):**  talking about mixing up tobacco and rotenone and all these things to deal with pests.  
**[0:49:46-0:50:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:49:46):**  The organic pest control and disease control industry has made huge headway.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:50:00):**  That's why I call the book Small Scale Organic Fruit Production in the 21st Century because  
**[0:50:06-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:50:06):**  at this point we have a lot of tools in the toolbox that we didn't have 20, 30, 40 years  
**[0:50:11-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:50:11):**  ago.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:50:13):**  Basically any sort of issue you're having, there is some product out there that can deal  
**[0:50:17-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:50:17):**  with it without using toxic chemicals and that goes for anything I can think of.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:50:24):**  Sometimes it just involves contacting various companies that deal in these products and  
**[0:50:29-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:50:29):**  just having a quick chat and just saying, hey, I'm having really bad problems with powdery  
**[0:50:34-0:50:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:50:34):**  mildew on gooseberries.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:50:36):**  What do you recommend?  
**[0:50:38-0:50:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:50:38):**  Not that the solution should be, oh, I'm having an issue, I need to reach for a bottle, but  
**[0:50:45-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:50:45):**  that can be useful and especially when you're doing it commercially, you may need a quick  
**[0:50:50-0:50:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:50:50):**  fix that's going to solve the problem organically so you don't have a crop loss or a big reduction  
**[0:50:56-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:50:56):**  in the crop, which could be a big economic factor for you.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:50:59):**  We have to be practical.

**[0:51:10-0:51:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:51:10):**  and shipped to your door in a few days.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:51:14):**  That's one of the benefits of where we're at right now with our technology.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:51:22):**  The big aha moments have been just around that, that understanding that any problem  
**[0:51:26-0:51:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:51:26):**  that you face can be dealt with these days with these modern solutions.  
**[0:51:32-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:51:32):**  Also just the importance of just basic protection, like deer protection, like I was saying.  
**[0:51:38-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:51:38):**  Also another one that's huge is just putting metal cages around the base of fruit trees  
**[0:51:44-0:51:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:51:44):**  or shrubs can just save the life of that plant from string trimmers, animals like voles or  
**[0:51:54-0:52:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:51:54):**  mice and other mechanical damage from getting hit and bashed with stuff.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:52:02):**  Just understanding the importance of protecting what you're investing in and what you're planting,  
**[0:52:09-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:52:09):**  it's an investment in time and resources.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:52:12):**  Just adding a little couple dollars worth and five or 10 minutes of your time to protect  
**[0:52:18-0:52:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:52:18):**  it can help ensure that it's going to be a long-term productive aspect of your farm.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:52:29):**  Another aha moment for me was understanding the power of vegan fertilizers.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:52:38):**  I had relied on fish emulsion for over 15 years from backyard gardening to doing it  
**[0:52:49-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:52:49):**  on a larger scale to doing it commercially.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:52:52):**  Using the fish emulsion just started to feel a little bit yucky, like there's just something  
**[0:52:57-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:52:57):**  about it, like it smells really bad and then you think about where it comes from and it's  
**[0:53:01-0:53:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:53:01):**  being shipped in from Alaska, which is very, very far away from us.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:53:07):**  I started considering vegan options.  
**[0:53:10-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:53:10):**  I also wanted something that I could put through a fertigation system that I knew was not going  
**[0:53:15-0:53:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:53:15):**  to make the fertigation system totally disgusting, like fish emulsion.  
**[0:53:20-0:53:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:53:20):**  Just imagine spraying that all over your greenhouse every day and what it's going to do to the  
**[0:53:25-0:53:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:53:25):**  pipes and the misters and the greenhouse itself.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:53:29):**  I started thinking I'm not doing that.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:53:31):**  I started looking into vegan options and there are some very, very high quality vegan fertility  
**[0:53:38-0:53:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:53:38):**  products out there these days that are made from fermented soy or fermented corn.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:53:45):**  There's various brands out there, Nature Safe, there's a few other ones.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:53:51):**  These products I'm using, I'm having amazing results with it.  
**[0:53:54-0:54:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:53:54):**  It's just so much more clean and sotvic than using these ground up animal byproducts.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:54:02):**  I'm just really, really pleased with it.

**[0:54:13-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:54:13):**  than the fish emulsion, probably better actually.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:54:16):**  They're less intense.  
**[0:54:17-0:54:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/blake-cothron-on-growing-berries-and-other-small-fruit-for-profit/#t=0:54:17):**  They're more gentle, but very, very effective.

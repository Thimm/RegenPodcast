**[0:00:52-0:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:00:52):**  Hey there and welcome back everybody!  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:00:54):**  Now today I'm really excited to share a special episode which comes from a presentation  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:00:59):**  that I gave about two weeks ago with Gaia Education, a leading organization in providing  
**[0:01:04-0:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:01:04):**  education and sustainable development.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:01:07):**  Through Ecosystem Restoration Camps, the NGO that I used to work with, I've co-facilitated  
**[0:01:12-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:01:12):**  the design portion of their Ecosystem Restoration Design course for the last couple of years.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:01:18):**  Now for the first time, they've made the course available for open rolling registration,  
**[0:01:23-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:01:23):**  which means that you no longer have to wait for the biannual sign up times and take the  
**[0:01:26-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:01:26):**  course within a 6 month window.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:01:29):**  In order to promote this new launch, they organized an online summit and I was invited  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:01:34):**  to present on a topic that I've been passionate about for years and that is the core motivation  
**[0:01:38-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:01:38):**  behind this podcast, which is to spread the message that regeneration is for everyone.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:01:44):**  So in this talk, which you can also find online in its unedited video form, which you can  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:01:49):**  watch on the show notes for this episode on the website, I introduce some of the key concepts  
**[0:01:54-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:01:54):**  that differentiate the concept of regeneration from other paradigms of thought.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:02:00):**  To illustrate some of the myriad examples of regeneration in action, I highlight 6 stories  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:02:05):**  of amazing individuals that I've had the pleasure to interview on this show in the  
**[0:02:09-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:02:09):**  past and that have inspired me in my work.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:02:12):**  And at the end, I wrap things up by outlining some of the design concepts and processes  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:02:17):**  that I teach in the course in order to guide students through the creation of their own  
**[0:02:21-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:02:21):**  projects through the group activity.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:02:24):**  Now though there is an important visual component of this presentation, I know that you'll  
**[0:02:28-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:02:28):**  get all the essential information from the audio, and I also highly encourage you to  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:02:31):**  listen to the interviews from the past with each of the people that I highlight in the  
**[0:02:35-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:02:35):**  talk.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:02:36):**  And a quick reminder, in case you're inspired by the concepts in this talk and the massive  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:02:40):**  potential of designing through this process, I'll be teaching a 5 day intensive in-person  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:02:45):**  course on regenerative design between the 11th and 16th of October at the beautiful  
**[0:02:50-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:02:50):**  green rebel farm in Miravet in Spain.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:02:53):**  Now we still have one or two spots available, and you can find out all of the details on  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:02:57):**  the website at regenerativeskills.com or through our bio on our Instagram account.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:03:02):**  Now with that out of the way, I will hand things over to, well, me, and my presentation  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:03:07):**  titled Regeneration is for Everyone.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:03:11):**  Through this presentation today, I want to talk to you about one of the things that I'm  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:03:14):**  most passionate about, which is showing people how they can participate, regardless of what  
**[0:03:19-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:03:19):**  their own skill set is, what their own experience and background are in the process of regeneration.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:03:26):**  And it's not all garden building and restoration of watersheds, even though that's my avenue  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:03:31):**  through this, and that's the avenue that I know most intimately and have experience in,  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:03:36):**  and that's often the examples that we teach through because there are so many wonderful  
**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:03:41):**  patterns in nature to use as reference, but whether you have worked in politics or business  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:03:47):**  or community organizing, or even if you don't have experience in any of those things and  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:03:52):**  just have a passion for either the natural world or connecting people, I mean, there's  
**[0:03:57-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:03:57):**  just so many entrances into this.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:04:00):**  And so with my presentation today, I'm hoping to give not only an overview of some of the  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:04:06):**  main considerations for the process of regeneration and how to think about it, how to frame your  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:04:11):**  project, even before you start a design, but also highlight some of my favorite and most  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:04:16):**  inspiring stories that I've gleaned from the podcast that I run from the last six years  
**[0:04:21-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:04:21):**  of running the show.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:04:23):**  I've had an opportunity to talk to people from all around the world, many different  
**[0:04:27-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:04:27):**  backgrounds, belief systems, experience levels, resource spaces, and they have found a way  
**[0:04:34-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:04:34):**  to leverage the unique tools and abilities that they have to enact really inspiring and  
**[0:04:42-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:04:42):**  impactful projects where they live.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:04:44):**  But yeah, so this is entitled Regeneration for Everyone because that is truly what I  
**[0:04:48-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:04:48):**  believe.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:04:49):**  And like I said, these stories I have mostly come across through finding examples of the  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:04:54):**  learning journey that I've gone through in the last six years as inspiration, as teachers,  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:04:59):**  as mentors of mine, and just people that I look up to and hope to emulate in the work  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:05:03):**  that I do, both with the company that I work with, Climate Farmers, like it was mentioned  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:05:07):**  before, and also the constant work that I'm doing with private clients and my own projects  
**[0:05:11-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:05:11):**  in my community.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:05:12):**  All right, so there are some key indicators for true regeneration.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:05:17):**  And the reason why I bring this up so early is because I feel like there is a very frequent  
**[0:05:21-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:05:21):**  misunderstanding and it gets conflated with other concepts in similar paradigms.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:05:28):**  What I mean by paradigm are often the intention and the mindset that you go into looking at  
**[0:05:34-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:05:34):**  problems or challenges with.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:05:37):**  We often hear, especially in the media, we're working towards sustainability.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:05:41):**  We need to make our systems and our industries and our political spheres more sustainable.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:05:46):**  But when we break this down, what it really means is that we just need them to break even.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:05:51):**  They're not necessarily doing anything above and beyond their capability.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:05:54):**  We just need them to stop breaking things and wasting resources so that they can continue  
**[0:05:58-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:05:58):**  as a status quo for longer.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:06:00):**  And it's one of the reasons why I feel our society at large has failed to become very  
**[0:06:04-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:06:04):**  inspired by this narrative.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:06:06):**  At the core of it, it's not a very inspiring concept to try and aspire to.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:06:10):**  And so moving on from there, we look at the do good paradigm, right, is to go into a situation  
**[0:06:16-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:06:16):**  and look for solutions and implement them.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:06:19):**  What is the best?  
**[0:06:20-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:06:20):**  What is the highest potential of what I can do for myself and my agenda in this place?  
**[0:06:26-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:06:26):**  And this is characteristic of a lot of NGO work, charity work, nonprofit efforts in all  
**[0:06:32-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:06:32):**  parts of the world.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:06:33):**  It's very common.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:06:35):**  And while this is definitely a step up from the sustainability paradigm, there are some  
**[0:06:41-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:06:41):**  issues with it as well.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:06:43):**  First and foremost, we often don't know what the solutions are for a problem until we get  
**[0:06:49-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:06:49):**  to know it intimately.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:06:52):**  Going in and trying to solve problems without a clear knowledge and an intimate connection  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:06:58):**  with the communities, the ecology and the history of a place, knowing its narratives  
**[0:07:02-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:07:02):**  and understanding the people and the lives that they lead and what exactly is most important  
**[0:07:10-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:07:10):**  in priorities for them can mean that we start to enforce or implement something that is  
**[0:07:16-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:07:16):**  perhaps most important to us or a solution that we have brought from another place that  
**[0:07:22-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:07:22):**  worked in a unique context cannot be necessarily reacted or superimposed onto a new place.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:07:31):**  There's a lot of other factors at play there.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:07:35):**  And so when we look at regeneration, the first thing that we need to consider is that level  
**[0:07:40-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:07:40):**  of understanding.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:07:41):**  And I'm going to go through the four kind of dynamic checks of things that you should  
**[0:07:46-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:07:46):**  consider even before you get to the design phase.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:07:49):**  And the reason why I like to make sure that we go over these first is because it's very  
**[0:07:53-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:07:53):**  tempting.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:07:54):**  I do this a lot myself as well to just jump right into design.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:07:56):**  All right, where do we put things?  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:07:58):**  What resources can we grab from here and there?  
**[0:08:00-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:08:00):**  How can we start to solve problems?  
**[0:08:02-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:08:02):**  We're really geared towards that mindset.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:08:04):**  And there's nothing wrong with it, but we can avoid a lot of mistakes and we can definitely  
**[0:08:09-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:08:09):**  avoid a lot of waste in resources and energy if we consider these next things first.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:08:15):**  So for me, the beginning is a keen understanding of the entirety of the whole that you're working  
**[0:08:22-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:08:22):**  with and how it's connected to other entireties in an ecosystem.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:08:30):**  Everything is some level of a fractal of an ecosystem, all the way down to the subatomic  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:08:34):**  particles that make up the building blocks of life, all the way to the hyper complex  
**[0:08:38-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:08:38):**  interconnected strata of communities and natural ecosystems and even into outer space and the  
**[0:08:45-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:08:45):**  universe.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:08:46):**  Right.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:08:47):**  These patterns repeat themselves.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:08:49):**  And so let's use an example of people.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:08:51):**  Right.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:08:52):**  We're often working in between connections with human beings.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:08:56):**  So in this context, a human being is an entire unit.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:09:00):**  Right.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:09:01):**  That is one expression of a whole, but it's nested within other holes.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:09:06):**  Humans are parts of families.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:09:08):**  Most of us, hopefully there's still aspects of our family intact and families are holes  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:09:14):**  within larger communities and communities are holes within governance systems or let's  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:09:20):**  say, ecologies of other life forms.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:09:24):**  And you can even break that down further.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:09:26):**  There are holes within our body.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:09:28):**  My liver is a whole organ, but none of these things function without the interactions and  
**[0:09:34-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:09:34):**  the connections between the other holes that they are nested within.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:09:37):**  Right.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:09:38):**  A person does not work very well or function very well without some sort of familial or  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:09:44):**  community support.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:09:46):**  We can function to a certain degree as individuals, but our potential is severely limited and  
**[0:09:51-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:09:51):**  we definitely can't survive without the interconnections and the relationships within our ecologies,  
**[0:09:59-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:09:59):**  our distribution networks, our support from other life forms.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:10:02):**  Right.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:10:03):**  And so knowing the hole that you are working with, let's say you're doing a project with  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:10:06):**  a school and the school is the hole that you are working with.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:10:12):**  Knowing that and then also understanding the connections that it is dependent on to make  
**[0:10:16-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:10:16):**  it function as the whole unit it is intended to be is always where I want to start.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:10:23):**  Moving on from there, you want to look at the unique essence of that hole because there  
**[0:10:28-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:10:28):**  are lots of other human beings.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:10:30):**  What are the things that make me unique?  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:10:32):**  What are the things that make you indivisible or incomparable to another human being?  
**[0:10:38-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:10:38):**  I mean, there are so many things that we have in common.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:10:41):**  So it takes a little while and it takes some keen observation and especially listening  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:10:46):**  to understand what it is that is unique about the hole that you are working with.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:10:52):**  To go back to the example of a school, right?  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:10:55):**  So if you're doing a school project, a school is a conglomeration of the people who attend  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:11:00):**  it, the people who maintain it, the people who work there, the people who fund it from  
**[0:11:04-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:11:04):**  outside and though they have those elements in common with other schools, the way that  
**[0:11:11-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:11:11):**  it's run, the history of the place, how it was founded, some defining moments, its geological  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:11:18):**  location, the type of climate and landscape that it's in, those all combine to create  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:11:24):**  something that is wholly unique about that space.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:11:28):**  Once you define the essence of your hole, you can move on to the next step, which is  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:11:32):**  an aim to develop the highest potential of that unique essence.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:11:38):**  The thing that is remarkable about an individual or an entity that we're working with helps  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:11:44):**  to define what its capabilities, what its capacity really is, right?  
**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:11:50):**  Because of that unique aspect that we've identified, it can become something that is entirely special  
**[0:11:55-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:11:55):**  to the potential of that place or unit or person or all of these examples that I've  
**[0:12:03-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:12:03):**  given.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:12:04):**  And each of these requires a new level of deep understanding of observation to really  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:12:11):**  collaborate with the thing that you are working with, with the people involved in the project,  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:12:15):**  with the stakeholders who are influencing it from outside to discover each of these  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:12:20):**  new layers of intimacy within the project that you're working with.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:12:26):**  And finally, you also need to understand your own abilities and your own resources, whether  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:12:31):**  you're working as an individual or with a larger group, to assist in the development  
**[0:12:36-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:12:36):**  of that potential.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:12:37):**  And this is what makes the regenerative design process unique is that at every step of the  
**[0:12:42-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:12:42):**  way, this is a collaboration, right?  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:12:44):**  You can't be imposing your will on it or you will not get to the same place and really  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:12:49):**  uncover the entire potential of your project if you are imposing what you think it should  
**[0:12:54-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:12:54):**  be rather than co-creating what its potential is with the organization or the unit or the  
**[0:13:01-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:13:01):**  life form that you are working with.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:13:03):**  Does all of that make sense so far?  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:13:06):**  Does anybody have any questions at this point or want me to elaborate on any of this?  
**[0:13:10-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:13:10):**  All right.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:13:11):**  I got my water in the end, so let's keep going.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:13:15):**  I have a question.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:13:17):**  I have a question.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:13:19):**  So I understand you completely, but what size and the amount of people is also for me very  
**[0:13:28-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:13:28):**  interesting to know what level are you able to communicate with a certain amount of people?  
**[0:13:35-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:13:35):**  Because for example, myself, I have difficulties with large structures, management of that.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:13:46):**  Is there like...  
**[0:13:47-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:13:47):**  Well, if you look at your restoration camps, I'm very curious how this whole management  
**[0:13:56-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:13:56):**  system works and how, for example, those volunteers that come to these camps are managed.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:14:05):**  And how do you cope, for example, with different opinions and what kind of skills do you need  
**[0:14:12-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:14:12):**  to come to a consensus?  
**[0:14:15-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:14:15):**  How does that work?  
**[0:14:17-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:14:17):**  Because I hear a little bit that there is no hierarchy within your organization.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:14:24):**  How do you make decisions and which way you go?  
**[0:14:28-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:14:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:14:29):**  Well, I can't speak for all of the different camps, but from the ones that I know more  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:14:37):**  personally, they all have a different structure that helps them function.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:14:42):**  One of the things that I get into in this module right at the beginning is looking at  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:14:46):**  a couple of different configurations about how you can form your group because the project  
**[0:14:50-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:14:50):**  is done within groups.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:14:52):**  And it's very intentionally done that way because no real regeneration effort or restoration  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:14:57):**  effort is ever accomplished as an individual.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:15:01):**  You have to be collaborating at some level.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:15:03):**  And so even if none of the people within your group during the course are actually working  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:15:08):**  on your project, you need to at least get the practice for how to coordinate with them  
**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:15:12):**  and start to leverage each person's unique gifts.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:15:16):**  So I can't speak to any of the actual structures that the camps are working with.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:15:20):**  I know a lot of them are in an evolutionary phase.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:15:23):**  So they've started with some initial ideas.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:15:25):**  They've tested it as they've gotten new members and volunteers, and they've adapted and grown  
**[0:15:30-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:15:30):**  as that has continued to evolve.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:15:32):**  That's really the best thing that I can recommend because we all have ideas about decentralized  
**[0:15:38-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:15:38):**  leadership or doing things on consensus or a lot of these concepts that have great basis.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:15:46):**  And they work for some people and they don't for others.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:15:49):**  They work for some organizations and they cause others to fall apart.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:15:52):**  And so I always recommend starting small with a concept and a couple of core members who  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:15:57):**  you trust and know that you can somewhat rely on at least.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:16:01):**  And then try and come up with a holistic context.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:16:04):**  It's another one of the activities that we do through the module, holistic context really  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:16:08):**  helps you to define the core motivations and the vision that you are working towards in  
**[0:16:13-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:16:13):**  a way that everybody is working in the kind of rowing in the same direction to use the  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:16:17):**  metaphor.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:16:19):**  And from that holistic context, communicating it with other people who come in that like,  
**[0:16:23-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:16:23):**  hey, this is really what we're doing here.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:16:26):**  We've defined it down to a quality of life and the future resource base that we will  
**[0:16:30-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:16:30):**  need to obtain or create in order to obtain a quality of life that we're all working towards.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:16:36):**  And who that includes, the resources you have to work with are going to be unique to every  
**[0:16:40-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:16:40):**  project.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:16:41):**  But having them defined is really good for getting everybody on the same page.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:16:45):**  From there, you can start to go into systems of governments, the agreements between members,  
**[0:16:52-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:16:52):**  allocating responsibilities and tasks.  
**[0:16:54-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:16:54):**  But starting from a core agreement of what is most important to you and the vision that  
**[0:17:01-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:17:01):**  you are working towards is a really important place to start.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:17:05):**  Because and I know this from personal experience in my life, it's very easy to just jump in  
**[0:17:09-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:17:09):**  and start doing things.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:17:10):**  Yeah, we're good friends.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:17:11):**  Yeah, we have a level of trust between each other and get quite far into a project and  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:17:15):**  realize, hey, we're making decisions from a very different understanding of where it  
**[0:17:19-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:17:19):**  is we want to end up.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:17:22):**  And if you don't have that in common, you're going to start to fight each other as you  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:17:25):**  pull away towards divergent visions.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:17:29):**  So I can't speak to how any group or organization should structure themselves.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:17:35):**  But I have gotten a lot of mileage out of taking the time in the beginning to define  
**[0:17:40-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:17:40):**  those things before you start to move forward.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:17:42):**  Does that answer your question?  
**[0:17:44-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:17:44):**  Yes, it answers my question.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:17:46):**  So if I understand it correctly, you're completely free in the way you are stepping into this  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:17:56):**  project if you want to start your project.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:18:00):**  Yeah, your restoration.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:18:04):**  As a foundation of the structures, I don't make any personal recommendations other than  
**[0:18:13-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:18:13):**  starting with those fundamentals that I just mentioned.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:18:16):**  But great question.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:18:17):**  All right, so I'm going to move on now to a quick overview of some of my favorite stories  
**[0:18:23-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:18:23):**  and inspirations from the podcast that I've run.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:18:25):**  And I'll go through them very quickly.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:18:27):**  But I will also leave links and we can put them in the chat too, to my own website and  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:18:33):**  the podcast itself where you can look up all of these people just by typing in the name  
**[0:18:37-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:18:37):**  and listen to the episodes that I recorded with them if you want to hear more details  
**[0:18:41-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:18:41):**  about their stories.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:18:43):**  So starting first with one of the stories that left the biggest impression on me, and  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:18:48):**  this was early when I was still living and working in Guatemala when I started the podcast.  
**[0:18:52-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:18:52):**  And Luwai'o Biswick is one of my favorite examples of people who are coming from areas  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:19:00):**  or backgrounds of very low resource access.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:19:03):**  I mean, he was one of 12 children in his family living in abject poverty in Malawi.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:19:10):**  And his parents, though they had a farm, struggled to feed their children to the point where  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:19:14):**  he had to leave home when he was quite young, I think 16 or 17, to go and make his own way  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:19:19):**  because there just were not enough resources in his household to keep all of the children  
**[0:19:24-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:19:24):**  fed.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:19:25):**  And he was determined to break out of that cycle of poverty and never be hungry or food  
**[0:19:33-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:19:33):**  scarce again.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:19:34):**  And though he tried out different things that did not support him well enough, he started  
**[0:19:41-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:19:41):**  to learn a little online and through his social network about permaculture.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:19:45):**  And permaculture is a common theme that you'll hear through a lot of these.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:19:47):**  Many people come into this concept and the idea of restoration through the teachings  
**[0:19:51-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:19:51):**  of permaculture, which are very profound.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:19:53):**  It was a large influence on me myself.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:19:56):**  And though he didn't take any formal classes, he started to put the principles and some  
**[0:20:00-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:20:00):**  of the actions and practices into use at his parents' farm.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:20:06):**  And within a couple of years, through the diversity and perennial plantings, working  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:20:12):**  with water and other patterns within the ecology, they reached a point where they had an abundance  
**[0:20:17-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:20:17):**  of food and that could actually sell it.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:20:19):**  And this inspired him to create the Permaculture Paradise Institute, where he very quickly  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:20:23):**  started to gain notoriety in his area and started to communicate and reach out to farmers  
**[0:20:27-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:20:27):**  and offer trainings in how they can transition their methods of production.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:20:31):**  Because even though they are in a very abundant climate with enough rainfall and irrigation,  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:20:37):**  most people in the conventional farming world are just like anywhere else, where they focus  
**[0:20:42-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:20:42):**  on things like corn and rice or other staple crop production at the detriment to the diversity  
**[0:20:48-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:20:48):**  of their ecology.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:20:50):**  And by teaching them about the potential of working with native plants, improving the  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:20:57):**  health of their soil, diversity within the system and stacking layers and functions,  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:21:01):**  working with natural patterns, he's helped to transform not only the food security of  
**[0:21:06-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:21:06):**  these places and his whole country increasingly.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:21:09):**  He's become a national celebrity, appeared on television and given courses to people  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:21:15):**  in government that is really having an impact on transforming the food production, the farming  
**[0:21:21-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:21:21):**  industry and the entire country.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:21:24):**  And so these are some pictures from his website and a plant exchange with farmers in his area.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:21:31):**  I think this is water hyacinth and they're talking about how it can help to improve the  
**[0:21:36-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:21:36):**  sanitation and the clarity of water bodies.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:21:40):**  And some of his graduates from over a thousand of the students who have passed through his  
**[0:21:45-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:21:45):**  school.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:21:48):**  Another one which is actually more recent from the show, in a previous series that I  
**[0:21:52-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:21:52):**  did on tree planting and agroforestry is Danny Baker.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:21:56):**  One of the reasons why I really latched on to this story is because she didn't start  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:22:00):**  gardening at all and they only bought their farm after she retired from her career.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:22:05):**  So she started in her 60s, mid to late 60s.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:22:09):**  And in just a few years after taking some courses, but mostly doing a lot of reading,  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:22:13):**  she started a one acre food forest garden on their farm, which is the centerpiece of  
**[0:22:18-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:22:18):**  a lot of what they do.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:22:19):**  And she actually wrote the book, The Homescale Forest Garden, talking about how she integrated  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:22:24):**  perennial species for a massive amount of diversity, perennial abundance in her small  
**[0:22:30-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:22:30):**  plot.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:22:32):**  And at this point, she's giving workshops and selling to local restaurants and chefs.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:22:40):**  And all of this while overcoming a very harsh, cold climate right on the northern edge of  
**[0:22:46-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:22:46):**  upstate New York and Canada on an island with very, very heavy clay soils, which a lot of  
**[0:22:53-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:22:53):**  people, if you've worked in gardens, know that those can be difficult to overcome.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:22:56):**  I know anybody from the Netherlands knows what I'm talking about.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:23:00):**  And so this is a picture of one of the tours that she gives and explaining all of the interconnections  
**[0:23:05-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:23:05):**  of the plants, how they support one another, how they add to the resilience of the system,  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:23:10):**  and each one holds its own function.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:23:14):**  Now moving beyond a little bit of the food focus is the story of Rebecca Burgess.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:23:21):**  Now her focus is actually on the production of fiber for our clothing in knowing just  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:23:26):**  how destructive and wasteful the fast fashion industry has become.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:23:30):**  It's actually the most polluting industry on the planet, even above oil and gas at this  
**[0:23:35-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:23:35):**  point.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:23:37):**  Most of our fabrics are all synthetic and plastic based, regardless of how they might  
**[0:23:42-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:23:42):**  feel, and her passion was to revive traditional and regenerative ways of producing the fibers  
**[0:23:50-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:23:50):**  that make our clothing, that make our textiles, and connecting with those traditions and land  
**[0:23:56-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:23:56):**  use practices in her area of Northern California.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:23:59):**  She wrote two books, the second of which is Fiber Shed, and she has worked with producers  
**[0:24:06-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:24:06):**  in her area as well as inspired others around the world who are harvesting fibers from and  
**[0:24:12-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:24:12):**  animals, like wool from sheep, or processing from flax or linen, or turning it into linen,  
**[0:24:20-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:24:20):**  and even all the way through the final processing to finished garments and textiles, really  
**[0:24:26-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:24:26):**  working to revive the appreciation for locally produced natural garments.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:24:33):**  And on top of that, she's also written, her first book was actually focused on how to  
**[0:24:37-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:24:37):**  produce natural dyes and all of the different plants that can be extracted to the array  
**[0:24:43-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:24:43):**  of colors that don't necessarily need chemicals and very toxic dyeing and coloring processes  
**[0:24:52-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:24:52):**  in order to enjoy the aesthetics of them and color our textiles and many other things.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:24:58):**  And all of this comes back to the land, right?  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:25:00):**  There are regenerative ways of producing all of these traditional fibers as well.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:25:06):**  Now this was close to the area that I grew up and Sean Sherman, who is more commonly  
**[0:25:12-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:25:12):**  these days known as the Sioux chef, Sioux being the Lakota Sioux name for his indigenous  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:25:17):**  tribe in the North Central Plains of the United States.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:25:22):**  He I believe grew up on a reservation somewhere in North or South Dakota, but eventually moved  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:25:26):**  to Minnesota, which is where I grew up, the Twin Cities area.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:25:30):**  And he worked in the restaurant industry for a while, but always remembered how underserved  
**[0:25:35-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:25:35):**  the populations on the native reservations and the native nations are in his area.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:25:43):**  And he wanted to help to revive not only the food practices and the cultivation methods,  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:25:49):**  but also the access to these things of those populations and bring prestige and reverence  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:25:54):**  back to these traditional ways of eating and caring for the land because of course they're  
**[0:25:59-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:25:59):**  closely interlinked.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:26:01):**  And through that, he wrote an award-winning cookbook called the Sioux chef indigenous  
**[0:26:07-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:26:07):**  kitchen, and it's since started a nonprofit organization that supports these efforts of  
**[0:26:11-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:26:11):**  reviving the food traditions and cultivation practices of indigenous people of the United  
**[0:26:17-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:26:17):**  States.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:26:18):**  He's held many training events and workshops for people all around the country.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:26:24):**  And actually, I think the last time that I caught up with him, he was traveling through  
**[0:26:27-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:26:27):**  Mesoamerica and back up through Canada in an attempt to catalog and bring about another  
**[0:26:35-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:26:35):**  recipe book from indigenous food traditions all the way through the North American continent.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:26:43):**  And has worked with many different age groups.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:26:47):**  And also when I caught up with him last, they were working on creating a food kitchen during  
**[0:26:52-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:26:52):**  the time of the pandemic to help people who are food insecure, not only to eat and be  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:26:59):**  nourished during that time, but to connect with the foods of their areas and the things  
**[0:27:04-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:27:04):**  that were produced locally.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:27:06):**  And I guess sticking once again with the food theme, we go to Meredith late.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:27:11):**  Now one of the reasons why this impacted me so much is that she started out as a vegan.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:27:17):**  And as she moved with her partner back then onto a small farm, she was reconnected to  
**[0:27:23-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:27:23):**  the raising of animals and started to understand that maybe there are other ways of fighting  
**[0:27:30-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:27:30):**  against the factory food model of animal production.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:27:35):**  That instead of just abandoning it all together, there are ways to actively participate in  
**[0:27:39-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:27:39):**  this.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:27:40):**  And that meat doesn't have to be a destructive way of eating and certainly doesn't have to  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:27:44):**  be bad for the animals as long as they are cared for and understood properly.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:27:49):**  And this led her to write two books, one on charcuterie and this one, one of my favorites,  
**[0:27:54-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:27:54):**  the ethical meat handbook, which is now in its second edition.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:27:58):**  And not only does it teach you everything about how to process and break down and cook  
**[0:28:03-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:28:03):**  and elaborate all of these different forms of meat from harvesting the animal all the  
**[0:28:09-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:28:09):**  way through the processing and the recipes, but also the ethics behind this.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:28:13):**  How we interact with and how we care for the animals throughout their entire stage of life.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:28:19):**  That this doesn't need to be a broken process and that simply abandoning meat products entirely  
**[0:28:25-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:28:25):**  is part of the reductionist solution mindset that we'd like to move past.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:28:31):**  Which isn't to say anything against vegetarians and vegans.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:28:33):**  I was vegetarian for a while, but looking more at the nuances and realizing that this  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:28:38):**  is going to be a part of our culture probably forever.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:28:42):**  And rather than simply abandoning it, finding healthy ways to interact with it and discover  
**[0:28:48-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:28:48):**  all of the potential for nourishing meals that use every, even the undervalued parts  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:28:54):**  of animals so that their lives and their bodies are fully respected and reconnecting with  
**[0:29:00-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:29:00):**  those traditions and those choice.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:29:02):**  And the last story that I'm going to profile real quickly here is that of Leah Pennyman.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:29:06):**  And she was actually a school teacher working in upstate New York when she became very aware  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:29:11):**  of the fact that her community really had no access to healthy, fresh food.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:29:16):**  And many of us are familiar with this concept as a term of food deserts, that there's simply  
**[0:29:22-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:29:22):**  no way to purchase these things.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:29:24):**  There's no local producers.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:29:25):**  And even if there are, they're selling to markets that take those resources away from  
**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:29:28):**  the community, leaving people with no access to good nutrition.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:29:33):**  And in order to overcome that, she started her own farm and began an activist work to  
**[0:29:40-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:29:40):**  not only bring healthy meals to her underserved community, but even digging deeper into uncovering  
**[0:29:46-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:29:46):**  and fighting against the systemic injustice of the United States system of removing people  
**[0:29:53-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:29:53):**  of color from land ownership.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:29:56):**  And in recent decades, despite all of the progress made in civil rights and the, I mean,  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:30:04):**  this is, I'm going to get called out for this, a reduction of racism.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:30:07):**  You could even call it the transformation or the turning of the face of the racist system  
**[0:30:11-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:30:11):**  in that country has reduced land ownership by people of color, especially black people  
**[0:30:16-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:30:16):**  in the United States, more than any previous time in American history, despite all of those  
**[0:30:21-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:30:21):**  other gains.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:30:23):**  And by bringing light to this and helping people to get training and increasingly land  
**[0:30:30-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:30:30):**  access programs through their nonprofit and through their awareness work on the farm,  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:30:35):**  they've been helping to create a new culture of farmers, finding their way back to land  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:30:39):**  ownership for the establishment of wealth and the reconnection of, of, you know, healthy  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:30:45):**  diets and food production in these underserved and marginalized communities.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:30:51):**  And again, this is just a very short preview of over, I think, 260 episodes that I've done  
**[0:30:57-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:30:57):**  now through the podcast.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:30:58):**  And so if these types of stories are inspiring to you, I really encourage you to look through  
**[0:31:03-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:31:03):**  those episodes.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:31:04):**  They're organized by category.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:31:06):**  You can search your own topics of interest, or if there's some name that you've heard  
**[0:31:09-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:31:09):**  that you would like to explore more with.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:31:11):**  I've got interviews with people like Gabe Brown from Regenerative Farming in the upper  
**[0:31:16-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:31:16):**  Midwest to activists work on a recombining or regaining access to common land in the  
**[0:31:23-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:31:23):**  United States and other places and on and on and on.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:31:26):**  Natural building was an early passion of mine.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:31:28):**  I cover quite a broad, I guess, range of regenerative skills and initiatives.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:31:37):**  And yeah, I guess I kind of glossed over some of those pictures there.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:31:41):**  And this is with their community work and training of people of color on their farm.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:31:47):**  Now before I wrap this up, I want to talk about some of the topics that we'll be going  
**[0:31:52-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:31:52):**  a lot deeper into in the actual training through the ecosystem restoration design course, especially  
**[0:31:59-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:31:59):**  on my module.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:32:00):**  Now the module is leading up to the end are giving you tangible examples and case studies  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:32:06):**  of exactly how this can be implemented in many different environmental contexts from  
**[0:32:10-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:32:10):**  deserts to, I guess, temperate forests and urban to very rural areas and quite a spectrum  
**[0:32:19-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:32:19):**  in between.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:32:20):**  So what I'm working to do in the final module is to break that down into a process that  
**[0:32:25-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:32:25):**  you can apply anywhere.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:32:27):**  And much like it's talked about in permaculture, we want to start with patterns and then go  
**[0:32:31-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:32:31):**  down to details, not the other way around.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:32:33):**  You can get pretty lost in that way.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:32:36):**  And in finding these patterns that are broadly applicable to many different contexts and  
**[0:32:41-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:32:41):**  places around the world, the message that I would really like to get through here, even  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:32:46):**  before we go into that, is that opportunities really are everywhere.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:32:51):**  And you don't need a fraction of what you think you do to get something like this started.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:32:57):**  Oftentimes just getting it started will bring the resources and the support that you will  
**[0:33:00-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:33:00):**  need in order to grow it.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:33:03):**  So you don't need land money, specialized training or degrees or big support networks.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:33:07):**  Some of the most impressive projects like the ones I've just highlighted were started  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:33:11):**  without almost any of those things.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:33:13):**  However, you do need things that are often glossed over.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:33:18):**  They may be free, but they do require an effort and a patience on your side.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:33:22):**  And so to listen and observe carefully, to understand your context, to learn about the  
**[0:33:27-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:33:27):**  holes and the nested holes that you're working within.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:33:30):**  A patience, because when working with living in natural systems, they do not bend to your  
**[0:33:35-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:33:35):**  timeline.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:33:36):**  And when you try and force them, that's often when bigger mistakes and costly errors can  
**[0:33:42-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:33:42):**  happen.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:33:43):**  So persistence goes right along with that patience.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:33:46):**  Because things don't necessarily happen on the timeline that our technology has gotten  
**[0:33:50-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:33:50):**  us accustomed to, we do need to push through even when there are obstacles in our path.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:33:56):**  And ultimately all of this is going to be limited by your capacity for imagination.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:34:02):**  Our own creativity and our ability to see what the potential, what the possibility is,  
**[0:34:07-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:34:07):**  is at the end of the day, our biggest limiting factor.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:34:11):**  And so we should all be working to break past that because it's within our own power.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:34:16):**  And so now that I've talked about all of these things to do before designing a regenerative  
**[0:34:20-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:34:20):**  project, we're just going to go over them once more and then start the design process,  
**[0:34:26-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:34:26):**  the things that I go into more detail in the course itself.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:34:29):**  So again, understanding your unique context, right?  
**[0:34:33-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:34:33):**  The description that I gave to that question earlier about, you know, who are the decision  
**[0:34:39-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:34:39):**  makers that you're working with?  
**[0:34:40-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:34:40):**  What is the quality of life that you wish to obtain?  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:34:43):**  And what is the future resource base that you're going to need to create or acquire  
**[0:34:47-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:34:47):**  somehow in order to support the quality of life that you're all working towards?  
**[0:34:53-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:34:53):**  And from there, learning about the history and the current state of the land that you're  
**[0:34:56-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:34:56):**  working with.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:34:57):**  Now, just a quick caveat, I know I was talking about there's so many different ways that  
**[0:35:01-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:35:01):**  you can get involved with this.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:35:03):**  The course itself is focused on doing restoration or regenerative work through a land base.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:35:10):**  But it doesn't mean you have to own the land.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:35:11):**  It doesn't even mean that it has to be owned by somebody that you know who gives you access.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:35:15):**  I am really inspired by the potential of working with public land.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:35:20):**  Oftentimes we think of public land as the primary places that we can't intervene in  
**[0:35:25-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:35:25):**  or touch, but it really should be something that everybody takes upon themselves to take  
**[0:35:29-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:35:29):**  care of and to coax into a higher potential.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:35:33):**  From there, you also need to connect deeply with your community.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:35:36):**  For the same reason that the projects that we're going to be doing in this course are  
**[0:35:39-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:35:39):**  not done alone, none of the projects that you're going to do out in the real world aren't  
**[0:35:44-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:35:44):**  done alone either.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:35:45):**  And of course, from there, you need to assess your available resources.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:35:48):**  And many of these can come in unconventional forms.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:35:51):**  You don't need to own everything.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:35:52):**  They may be available to borrow.  
**[0:35:54-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:35:54):**  They may be able to find, acquire through non-conventional means.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:36:01):**  It's not all just about purchasing.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:36:04):**  And then of course, in the design process itself, we're going to be borrowing things  
**[0:36:07-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:36:07):**  from a lot of different practices, which are very valid.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:36:10):**  Things like invisible structures, getting to know the regulatory bodies, the governance  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:36:15):**  systems that allow you to do certain things and could even put penalties or clear restrictions  
**[0:36:20-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:36:20):**  on some things that you would really like to do.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:36:22):**  Unfortunately, there's a lot of places where we're not allowed to do very positive work  
**[0:36:26-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:36:26):**  because of those limiting structures.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:36:29):**  And also the scale of permanence pioneered by a guy named P.A.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:36:32):**  Yeomans, who talks about the elements and their permanence within a landscape and how  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:36:36):**  to design in the sequence so that you don't end up having to go back and do things for  
**[0:36:41-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:36:41):**  having not considered them in the right order.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:36:44):**  Zones of use help you decide where to put the majority of your energies and the majority  
**[0:36:49-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:36:49):**  of your resources for things that need higher maintenance.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:36:52):**  And then of course, the web of connections, how the connections between the elements that  
**[0:36:56-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:36:56):**  you are designing for and implementing can support one another without you having to  
**[0:37:00-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:37:00):**  put further energy and resources in to maintain them.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:37:03):**  And energy flows and cycles are the things that connect all of these elements.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:37:07):**  How can we direct those in effective ways so that we minimize the amount of work that  
**[0:37:11-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:37:11):**  we need to do and the inefficiency of the system for being disconnected?  
**[0:37:16-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:37:16):**  And of course, all of this stuff you can learn a lot more about both through my podcast on  
**[0:37:20-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:37:20):**  my website, regenerative skills dot com, where I've also got articles and educational resources  
**[0:37:26-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:37:26):**  there.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:37:27):**  There's free e-books.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:37:28):**  There's a lot that can help to accelerate your learning here for free.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:37:32):**  And if or when you are ready to get much deeper into this, that's why we're here talking about  
**[0:37:36-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:37:36):**  the course, because all of this is included in this learning.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:37:41):**  All of those principles and those design patterns that I talked about are gone over in much  
**[0:37:45-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:37:45):**  greater detail in the coursework itself.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:37:48):**  And there are worksheets and systems to follow and ways to collaborate with your team members  
**[0:37:53-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:37:53):**  so that you don't have to take on all the work yourself.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:37:56):**  You can help to bring out the real skills and talents of the people that you're working  
**[0:38:00-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:38:00):**  with on these projects.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:38:02):**  And so before we start to direct the questions my way, I'm going to leave you with one of  
**[0:38:06-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:38:06):**  my own, which, of course, is knowing this and knowing that you all have something to  
**[0:38:11-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:38:11):**  contribute, regardless of your background and experience level.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:38:15):**  What is your contribution going to be?  
**[0:38:17-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:38:17):**  Every one of us has the potential to to bring about real change in our areas.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:38:22):**  And it doesn't have to be on a big, massive global or country scale.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:38:26):**  We can start in our own homes.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:38:27):**  We can start in our own communities and our own families.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:38:31):**  And in fact, that's where I would recommend to start, because the consequences of failure  
**[0:38:35-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:38:35):**  are a lot smaller.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:38:37):**  So thank you so much for indulging me here.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:38:39):**  I will hand it over to our facilitators if they want to organize this Q&A session here.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:38:44):**  We've got a good 15 minutes left, and I'm happy to leave my contact information by the  
**[0:38:49-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/regeneration-is-for-everyone-stories-from-the-regenerative-skills-community/#t=0:38:49):**  end of this, too, if anyone wants to reach out to me in person.

**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:00:13):**  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:00:25):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this  
**[0:00:29-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:00:29):**  next episode, so let's jump right in.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:00:59):**  I finally had the chance to do a follow-up session with one of my favorite natural builders,  
**[0:01:20-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:01:20):**  April McGill.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:01:21):**  She's not only an accomplished architect, builder, and educator through her company  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:01:25):**  Root Down Design and the American College of the Building Arts, she's also constantly  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:01:30):**  experimenting with new techniques and materials as you'll hear in this episode.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:01:35):**  Back in the first interview that I recorded with April, we dissected rammed earth and  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:01:39):**  how she was working to revive the craft for all its potential benefits for her climate  
**[0:01:43-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:01:43):**  and conditions in Charleston, North Carolina.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:01:46):**  This time we talk about hempcrete and how its anti-molding, insulative properties are  
**[0:01:51-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:01:51):**  presenting all kinds of new options for builders whose contexts call for insulation to overcome  
**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:01:57):**  the large temperature swings in different seasons and also need to resist the humidity.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:02:03):**  We talk about her recent experiments in packing forms in traditional framed homes, the mixture  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:02:08):**  that she's had success with that includes the pozzolan additive metakaolin, as well  
**[0:02:13-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:02:13):**  as where certain materials are sourced from.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:02:16):**  The second half of the interview we dedicate to the topic of home renovations and how it  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:02:20):**  can often be more environmentally responsible to repair and retrofit an existing home than  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:02:25):**  to build an entirely new one, even if it's made primarily with natural materials.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:02:30):**  This interview gives a realistic view of some of the common topics that you listeners have  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:02:34):**  asked me about in the past, and I'm always excited to talk to professionals who give  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:02:38):**  an honest account of costs, processes, and help to bust myths about natural building  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:02:44):**  and the construction trades in general.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:02:47):**  Now in case you're looking for even more information on the myths and realities of building for  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:02:51):**  yourself or hiring a contractor to build a natural structure, you can also check out  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:02:55):**  the article that sums these things up called The Real Cost of a Natural Building by clicking  
**[0:03:00-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:03:00):**  on the link in the show notes or in the catalog of articles in the navigation bar at AbundantEdge.com.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:03:06):**  I really feel motivated to give people the most accurate picture of the whole process  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:03:09):**  of building a natural structure for themselves since social media and so many clickbait articles  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:03:14):**  have planted unrealistic expectations around the web.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:03:18):**  So without droning on too long, I'll hand things over now to April.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:03:21):**  Hey, April, thank you so much for coming back and talking with me.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:03:25):**  It's such a pleasure to chat with you again.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:03:26):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:03:27-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:03:27):**  Doing great, Oliver.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:03:28):**  Thanks for having me.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:03:29):**  My pleasure.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:03:30):**  Now, we're just kind of winding down at the end of this summer here.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:03:34):**  How has the season for building and teaching been for you this year?  
**[0:03:38-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:03:38):**  It's been busy.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:03:39):**  Yeah, it's been great.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:03:41):**  There's a lot of growing interest around these concepts and these methods and materials.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:03:48):**  So I think that's exciting to see just a very consistent growth in terms of people's interest  
**[0:03:56-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:03:56):**  and people's action around wanting to shift over into more environmentally sensitive materials  
**[0:04:07-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:04:07):**  and methods.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:04:08):**  Yeah, that's fantastic.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:04:09):**  I'm glad to hear it.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:04:12):**  Now, if people are interested in hearing about your background, I'm going to refer them back  
**[0:04:16-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:04:16):**  to the episode that we recorded in an earlier season where we talked more about reviving  
**[0:04:22-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:04:22):**  rammed earth and hybrid buildings.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:04:25):**  But today, we'll focus more on an innovative material called hempcrete and also on the possibilities  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:04:30):**  of environmentally responsible renovations and making healthy homes.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:04:35):**  So why don't we start at the beginning with hempcrete?  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:04:37):**  Could you define hempcrete and talk about some of its advantages and limitations?  
**[0:04:42-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:04:42):**  Sure.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:04:44):**  So hempcrete was established in Europe, I believe a couple decades ago.  
**[0:04:53-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:04:53):**  And it's just a method of taking the hemp fiber and combining it with a lime slurry  
**[0:05:06-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:05:06):**  and you're making a lightweight insulation that gets packed in between formwork.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:05:14):**  And so it can be integrated with stud framing or timber framing.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:05:20):**  It really works hand in hand with conventional framing methods.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:05:26):**  So essentially, it's a lightweight insulation that is breathable, vapor permeable, rot proof,  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:05:38):**  mold proof, termite proof, and fire resistant.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:05:42):**  And then it's also a carbon sequester in that the hemp fiber itself, as it grows, is sequestering  
**[0:05:54-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:05:54):**  carbon from the atmosphere and storing that in its fiber.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:05:59):**  And then lime also, as it continues to cure over the course of many, many, many years,  
**[0:06:08-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:06:08):**  continues to suck carbon from the atmosphere.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:06:10):**  So we see hempcrete as a carbon negative material for its ability to continue to suck carbon  
**[0:06:20-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:06:20):**  out of the atmosphere.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:06:22):**  It's also being produced with a rapidly renewable resource, no toxins, no VOCs.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:06:31):**  And one of the biggest pros that I see for especially my climate region where it's so  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:06:38):**  wet is its ability to handle moisture.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:06:42):**  I don't have the numbers right in front of me, but I know that it has the ability to  
**[0:06:49-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:06:49):**  take on an incredible amount of moisture and store it in its walls without failing or developing  
**[0:06:58-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:06:58):**  mold or mildews.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:07:00):**  And so I think that's a really, really strong quality for my region.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:07:07):**  And as far as the limitations go, I would say at this point, we're still sourcing of  
**[0:07:16-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:07:16):**  the hemp fiber itself is still a bit challenging.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:07:19):**  You can order from Canada where it's being grown more abundantly.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:07:26):**  The United States is on the up and up with hemp production, but most people, most of  
**[0:07:33-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:07:33):**  the farmers growing hemp are growing for seed, for the CBD oils and whatnot.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:07:39):**  There's only a few operations growing the fiber.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:07:45):**  So there are a couple of operations, but the resources are still a bit limited.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:07:56):**  And then also as with many of our alternative methods, having people who can build with  
**[0:08:04-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:08:04):**  that material.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:08:05):**  So having qualified builders remains to be one of the big challenges that we face, I  
**[0:08:12-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:08:12):**  think with all of these methods is building up our supply of qualified people who understand  
**[0:08:19-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:08:19):**  the method and who can build with it.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:08:22):**  So if I understand correctly, this is a wall infill method and has to be supported by some  
**[0:08:26-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:08:26):**  sort of other structure.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:08:27):**  It can't support any weight or isn't structurally viable on its own?  
**[0:08:33-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:08:33):**  That's right.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:08:34):**  Yeah, it's just infill.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:08:35):**  It's just a insulation and you can use it in the walls, in your ceiling, in your floor.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:08:44):**  It can be used under slabs, but it's not structural.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:08:47):**  It does have some thermal mass qualities because of the lime.  
**[0:08:54-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:08:54):**  So you are getting insulation value and you're getting a little bit of thermal mass, which  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:09:01):**  is nice, but you're definitely not getting the strength that you would need for it to  
**[0:09:06-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:09:06):**  be a load bearing material.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:09:12):**  And so what are some of the ratios that you're putting in here?  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:09:15):**  What is the quantity of lime to hemp fiber in this case?  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:09:20):**  And is it coming in prepackaged amounts or are you getting it in, I assume not bales  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:09:26):**  because the fibers aren't very long?  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:09:28):**  Yeah, so you're going to cause me to have to pull up my notes here.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:09:35):**  So, well, I'll first of all say that everything I've learned about hempcrete I've learned  
**[0:09:40-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:09:40):**  through Chris Magwood at the Endeavor Center, who also has an awesome book called Hempcrete  
**[0:09:48-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:09:48):**  Construction.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:09:49):**  But Chris, I had Chris come down here to South Carolina in this past spring to lead a hempcrete  
**[0:09:57-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:09:57):**  workshop and so I learned an incredible amount from him.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:10:04):**  And so there are different options and I would really have to pull up my notes and my videos  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:10:18):**  to give you the exact proportions.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:10:20):**  But basically, if I'm remembering correctly, I think we did, Chris is going to have to  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:10:31):**  call me out on this because I'm probably going to say it wrong, but I believe it was like  
**[0:10:34-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:10:34):**  four five gallon buckets of hemp fiber to, I want to say one bucket of the lime mix,  
**[0:10:48-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:10:48):**  but I would have to go back and double check that for you.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:10:51):**  Is that a pre-hydrated mix?  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:10:52):**  So you're working with powdered hydraulic lime and the water's already added?  
**[0:10:57-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:10:57):**  Well, yeah, so there's a lot of different options.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:11:00):**  And one of the things that Chris did before he came down here to South Carolina to teach,  
**[0:11:07-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:11:07):**  he really helped me to explore what materials and resources we have available in my region,  
**[0:11:15-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:11:15):**  which I think is always important.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:11:17):**  So you can purchase a proprietary blend from Europe and it can get shipped over here to  
**[0:11:26-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:11:26):**  you and it comes in a bag.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:11:28):**  It's your lime mix and you just add water and mix the fiber and you go.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:11:34):**  However, that's a more costly way to do it because that mix is very expensive and then  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:11:43):**  you're also tacking on the carbon footprint of shipping it over from Europe.  
**[0:11:49-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:11:49):**  So the other alternative is to use a standard, you could use an NHL lime, which is your more  
**[0:12:03-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:12:03):**  hydraulic lime and it's also a more expensive lime to purchase.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:12:13):**  Or if you don't have access to the NHL and the NHL is also coming from Europe.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:12:19):**  It is not NHL lime is not manufactured in the United States.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:12:24):**  So if you're looking for a more regional way to do it, you can take a standard type S lime,  
**[0:12:34-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:12:34):**  which is just your standard hydrated lime.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:12:37):**  It's a lot cheaper.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:12:38):**  I can get it here for about $12 a bag.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:12:42):**  And then you want to add a pozzolan into that mix and a pozzolan is going to mix with your  
**[0:12:50-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:12:50):**  lime and create a chemical reaction and make the lime cure faster and cure harder.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:12:57):**  Essentially you're making your own version of an NHL hydraulic lime.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:13:03):**  And so that's what we did because we discovered a material called metakaolin, which is a kaolin  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:13:13):**  clay that's been fired.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:13:15):**  And once it's been fired, it then becomes a pozzolan.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:13:20):**  And this is a material that's actually manufactured here in South Carolina.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:13:25):**  We have a metakaolin factory a couple hours from where I live.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:13:31):**  And so Chris discovered that.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:13:32):**  And so it was kind of a no brainer that we might as well get equal parts metakaolin to  
**[0:13:39-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:13:39):**  equal parts type S and we mixed the two at a 50 50 ratio and we created essentially the  
**[0:13:47-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:13:47):**  NHL lime at a much cheaper cost and a more locally based way of sourcing the material.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:13:56):**  So we mix the metakaolin and the lime 50 50 and you just mix it dry, pour it into a bucket.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:14:06):**  And then we used a mortar mixer and we poured the hemp fiber in first and then you pour  
**[0:14:15-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:14:15):**  in the lime metakaolin mix and then we added water and you kind of just do that slowly  
**[0:14:23-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:14:23):**  until you get sort of almost like a granola kind of a consistency.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:14:28):**  So it's kind of dry and you just let that mixer do its thing.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:14:35):**  And until it looks like all of the lime and metakaolin have been fully mixed and hydrated  
**[0:14:43-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:14:43):**  and then you dump it out of the mixer, carry it over to your wall either in buckets or  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:14:49):**  in a wheelbarrow and then it gets poured into the form work.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:14:54):**  So nice.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:14:55):**  I mean it sounds like a long process when you kind of spell out every single one of  
**[0:15:00-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:15:00):**  the steps.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:15:01):**  But once you have the materials prepared, I would imagine it starts to go pretty fast  
**[0:15:04-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:15:04):**  and it's very applicable.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:15:06):**  And there was definitely, you know, we had we had a recipe.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:15:11):**  So and again, I'd have to pull my notes and I took tons of videos and so I have the info.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:15:17):**  I don't have it in front of me.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:15:19):**  But you know, we had a recipe that was like so many buckets of fiber to so many buckets  
**[0:15:25-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:15:25):**  of lime.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:15:27):**  And that makes a good mix in the mortar mixer.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:15:32):**  And then so it was really easy.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:15:33):**  I mean, I, you know, I'm used to doing workshops and classes on building with earth.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:15:41):**  And for one, building with earth is so much heavier.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:15:46):**  Carrying a bucket of mud versus a bucket of hempcrete is like, it's so nice.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:15:53):**  The whole time I was like, Oh my god, this is so easy.  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:15:56):**  This is so easy.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:15:57):**  Because you know, you can just carry the bucket easily, lift it up over your head, dump it  
**[0:16:03-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:16:03):**  into the form.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:16:04):**  And so I found it to be incredibly fast and, and, and much less labor intensive than what  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:16:12):**  I was used to with more of the earth and methods.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:16:16):**  Sure, as an advantage of the non load bearing materials, they don't have to be so.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:16:21):**  So I assume then in this workshop, you were building with limecrete as poured forms, much  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:16:28):**  like you would with rammed earth except for rather than acting it nearly as densely.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:16:33):**  I mean, I'm sure you'd have to compact a little bit to make sure that there weren't any vacancies  
**[0:16:37-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:16:37):**  or like air pockets in there.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:16:39):**  Yes, well, you actually want air pockets, you know, for to have a good insulation, you  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:16:46):**  want as much air in that material as possible.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:16:50):**  So the more air that's in there, the better the insulation, the more packed and dense  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:16:57):**  it is, the better thermal mass and less insulation you're going to have.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:17:02):**  So you're more spreading it around?  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:17:04):**  Yeah, and really, you're just you have this just a really simple piece of wood, I think  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:17:10):**  we use like little chunks of two by fours.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:17:14):**  And once it gets poured into the form, you're really just going right along the edge, kind  
**[0:17:19-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:17:19):**  of right around the perimeter.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:17:21):**  And you're using your little stick, and you're just tamping it down right around the perimeter  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:17:26):**  so that you have a really tight surface edge.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:17:30):**  And then in the middle, you're almost you're not even tamping that you're just kind of  
**[0:17:34-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:17:34):**  using your hand and giving it a really soft compression, but you want to leave it pretty  
**[0:17:41-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:17:41):**  fluffy and loose in the middle, but then just have your edges tamped more solid.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:17:48):**  Sure.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:17:49):**  And so as you rise up in these other lifts, is there a risk that the material down below  
**[0:17:54-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:17:54):**  is not curing fast enough that it might start to get compressed as you build up above it?  
**[0:18:00-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:18:00):**  Um, no, we didn't really have that issue.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:18:04):**  Um, and I guess it's light enough material.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:18:07):**  It's not putting a ton of pressure on the layers below.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:18:10):**  Cool.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:18:11):**  Like, I mean, we just it's pretty amazing how fast you can go because we did our formwork  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:18:18):**  was about three feet tall.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:18:22):**  So we did about a three foot section.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:18:25):**  And then by the time we finished that section, we just took it off and moved it up the wall  
**[0:18:30-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:18:30):**  and the stuff below stayed right in place.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:18:36):**  Because yeah, you're not you're not really pushing it down that hard.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:18:40):**  So it's pretty incredible how how fast the work goes and how quick you can move up the  
**[0:18:47-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:18:47):**  wall.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:18:48):**  So tell me a bit about the formwork then.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:18:51):**  I know you're familiar with using different types of forms with the rammed earth.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:18:56):**  Is it a different types of form or like it doesn't have to be as sturdy?  
**[0:19:00-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:19:00):**  No, no, no, no, like, so with the rammed earth, your forms have to be pretty beefy.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:19:07):**  Because you are compacting really heavy dense material, you're fully compacting it.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:19:13):**  So with rammed earth, you're using, we use a marine grade plywood, so we get a really,  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:19:21):**  really smooth surface.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:19:22):**  So you don't see any of that plywood grain in the wall.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:19:28):**  But with with hempcrete, it's really just a temporary form to be there while you compact  
**[0:19:38-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:19:38):**  it.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:19:39):**  So we were just using standard three quarter inch or five eighths inch plywood, you can  
**[0:19:48-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:19:48):**  use OSB, it really doesn't matter.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:19:51):**  I think, you know, as long as it's not going to bend or warp.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:19:56):**  You just it's really just a temporary lightweight material that's keeping it in place and then  
**[0:20:01-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:20:01):**  you move it up the wall.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:20:03):**  So yeah, it's really simple.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:20:04):**  Just screw it into the studs and then and then you take it down and move it up.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:20:13):**  And so how are you finishing the wall?  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:20:14):**  I assume that it might be a little bit crumbly since you're not compacting it very densely  
**[0:20:19-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:20:19):**  the way you are with earth.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:20:21):**  Yeah, so there's different ways to finish it out.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:20:26):**  And it really comes down to the aesthetics that you want and also and probably the location  
**[0:20:39-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:20:39):**  and the application.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:20:41):**  So we on the interior side, you have options you could finish it with clay plaster, lime  
**[0:20:50-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:20:50):**  plaster.  
**[0:20:52-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:20:52):**  You could even fur it out with furring strips and apply a MGO board.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:21:04):**  So there's a lot of a lot of options there.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:21:08):**  And then on the exterior, the same kind of thing, you can finish it with clay plasters,  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:21:15):**  lime plasters, or you can do a rain screen application where you have the furring strips  
**[0:21:21-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:21:21):**  and you have an air gap.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:21:23):**  And then you could use your wood siding or metal or whatever it is that you're going  
**[0:21:29-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:21:29):**  for.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:21:32):**  You know, the big rules of thumb just like with all of our natural building methods is  
**[0:21:36-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:21:36):**  breathability.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:21:37):**  So you want to make sure you have breathability all the way through that wall system.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:21:43):**  You don't want to come in and put like a plywood sheathing on the exterior that's not going  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:21:48):**  to allow that vapor to move through it.  
**[0:21:53-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:21:53):**  And you know, I think it just boils down to the design, you know, are the walls really  
**[0:22:00-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:22:00):**  exposed?  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:22:01):**  If so, I would probably be more inclined to do the rain screen method on the exterior  
**[0:22:07-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:22:07):**  and do some kind of a wood cladding.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:22:10):**  But if it was a more protected wall, like underneath of a porch or something, then I  
**[0:22:15-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:22:15):**  would probably go with a clay or a lime plaster.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:22:21):**  In our workshop, we did some clay plasters.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:22:26):**  We mixed a clay, standard clay soil plaster, and we added hemp fiber into the mix just  
**[0:22:37-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:22:37):**  to add some fiber.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:22:38):**  And so we did a leveling coat first with a clay fiber rich clay plaster that turned out  
**[0:22:48-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:22:48):**  to be really, really hard.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:22:51):**  And then from there you could go with a more refined clay plaster or a lime plaster.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:22:57):**  So yeah, there's a lot of options as long as you're not putting an impermeable, non-breathable  
**[0:23:06-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:23:06):**  material on it.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:23:10):**  Your latex paints, your cement stuff, things like that.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:23:14):**  Exactly.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:23:15):**  Yeah, so you do get a little bit of crumbly crumbles, but once you plaster it, you know,  
**[0:23:25-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:23:25):**  all of that is really just kind of glued together.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:23:28):**  And in fact, Chris said that they are experimenting at his school with, on the interior side,  
**[0:23:36-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:23:36):**  actually leaving the hempcrete exposed because you actually get a really cool aesthetic.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:23:43):**  It's very similar to rammed earth because you get those layers.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:23:47):**  You see the layers, you know, because you're tamping it in lifts.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:23:51):**  So you get like, you see those, that sort of striation of layers.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:23:57):**  And so they're playing around with making a more lime rich mix and tamping it a little  
**[0:24:08-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:24:08):**  bit harder on that interior face and seeing if they can create a hempcrete interior wall  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:24:16):**  that would not need to have any plaster.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:24:21):**  Maybe some kind of a clear glaze or something, you know, could be painted on.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:24:27):**  But I thought that was a pretty cool thing to experiment with.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:24:32):**  Yeah, I love that the people who have schools and students and places of demonstration are  
**[0:24:37-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:24:37):**  tampering with all these things to see what works.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:24:40):**  They're really the ones kind of pushing to see how these materials kind of perform in  
**[0:24:44-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:24:44):**  the long run.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:24:45):**  Yeah, and in fact, I'm getting, I'm starting right now a semester course with my students  
**[0:24:53-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:24:53):**  at the American College of the Building Arts.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:24:56):**  And we're going to be building a kids clubhouse for a neighborhood down here.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:25:04):**  And through that course, we're going to do some of our own experimentation.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:25:10):**  And I'm working with hemp fiber reinforced rammed earth because in seismic and high wind  
**[0:25:20-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:25:20):**  areas, you have to reinforce the rammed earth just like you would with other masonry methods.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:25:26):**  And the standard industry practice is to embed rebar, which we a lot of us kind of question  
**[0:25:34-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:25:34):**  whether or not that's the best way, you know, to reinforce the material if it's really doing  
**[0:25:40-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:25:40):**  anything, you know, the carbon footprint, yada yada yada.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:25:43):**  So there was a graduate student who actually did a thesis on fiber reinforced rammed earth  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:25:52):**  and the results came out really well.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:25:57):**  So that's, you know, what I would like to shift to is, you know, continuously improving  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:26:02):**  these methods so that we can keep getting them more and more sustainable.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:26:07):**  So if we can eliminate the rebar from the rammed earth and instead use hemp fiber as  
**[0:26:12-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:26:12):**  the reinforcing, you know, use lime as the stabilizer instead of cement.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:26:19):**  So that's what we'll be working on this semester in my class.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:26:24):**  That's exciting.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:26:25):**  Pretty exciting.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:26:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:26:27):**  So with these types of new materials and even the revival of old and traditional natural  
**[0:26:31-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:26:31):**  building materials, where do you start to see the opportunity to renovate or remodel  
**[0:26:38-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:26:38):**  traditional or industrial buildings and homes, either with add ons or changes or fixes into  
**[0:26:45-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:26:45):**  the structure that can extend the life of the building, give it kind of a revival, or  
**[0:26:52-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:26:52):**  even just improve it all together?  
**[0:26:55-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:26:55):**  Yeah, and this is an interesting conversation that Chris Magwood and I had when he was in  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:27:01):**  town because Charleston is an old, very old city.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:27:05):**  We have really, really old buildings in our downtown that get back to the 1600s.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:27:15):**  And so there's a big preservation and restoration focus here in Charleston.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:27:20):**  And as spray foam insulation has become more and more popular, a lot of these historic  
**[0:27:31-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:27:31):**  old buildings are being retrofitted with spray foam insulations.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:27:37):**  And these are buildings that have always been able to breathe.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:27:41):**  They've never been, you know, sealed up tight before.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:27:46):**  And so there are issues that come with making a building, especially an older building,  
**[0:27:56-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:27:56):**  too tight and not having the proper ventilation on the inside anymore.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:28:01):**  So then you get a buildup of moisture and moisture problems.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:28:06):**  So we were talking about how we think, especially hempcrete, would be a fabulous way to retrofit  
**[0:28:14-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:28:14):**  a lot of these old buildings because of its breathability potential.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:28:20):**  And you could insulate the buildings and get a really tight envelope, but it would still  
**[0:28:25-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:28:25):**  be vapor permeable.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:28:27):**  And you would allow that building to be able to breathe.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:28:30):**  And I think, you know, to preserve the longevity of a lot of these really old buildings in  
**[0:28:34-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:28:34):**  this really old wood would be better suited to use something like hempcrete, which could  
**[0:28:42-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:28:42):**  feel that kind of moisture movement instead of your spray foam insulations.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:28:48):**  So I think whether it's a historic home or even just an existing home, I mean, I think  
**[0:28:56-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:28:56):**  you can definitely do hempcrete retrofits to existing homes.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:29:03):**  And that's an ongoing conversation and something, a place that I would like to really take my  
**[0:29:12-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:29:12):**  work.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:29:13):**  I think renovations are really important and often overlooked.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:29:18):**  We focus so much on new construction, but there's so many buildings already here that  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:29:25):**  need some TLC.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:29:29):**  And I think that we can certainly retrofit and renovate existing structures using hempcrete  
**[0:29:40-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:29:40):**  or other methods in lieu of, I keep going back to spray foam because it's what has become  
**[0:29:51-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:29:51):**  very, very...  
**[0:29:52-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:29:52):**  It's pretty awful stuff.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:29:53):**  I mean, I get why it's popular.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:29:54):**  It's dropped in price.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:29:55):**  It's easy.  
**[0:29:56-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:29:56):**  Very easy to...  
**[0:29:57-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:29:57):**  Yeah, the application is really easy.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:29:58):**  It goes quick and stuff, but man, the VLCs from that and the...  
**[0:30:03-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:30:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:30:04):**  And that's, you know, again, I keep talking about Chris because he's kind of like my idol  
**[0:30:09-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:30:09):**  now.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:30:10):**  Hey, Chris.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:30:11):**  I just had an interview with him.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:30:12):**  I published his episode maybe two or three weeks ago.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:30:15):**  So we did talk a little bit about hempcrete and yeah.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:30:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:30:21):**  He blew my mind with all of his research that he presented on while he was here and really  
**[0:30:27-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:30:27):**  broke it down to layman's turns so easily and being able to see in chart form and in  
**[0:30:35-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:30:35):**  graphic form all these materials that we use and then understanding which ones really truly  
**[0:30:44-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:30:44):**  have the highest carbon footprint as well as the toxic emissions of chemicals during  
**[0:30:53-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:30:53):**  the...  
**[0:30:54-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:30:54):**  Not just during the production, but also once it's in the building.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:30:57):**  And then also thinking about the long-term cost of that, where the materials are going  
**[0:31:03-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:31:03):**  to go and I live in a coastal area.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:31:06):**  And so I'm thinking, you know, when we get sacked by a huge hurricane, all of the spray  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:31:13):**  foam and styrofoam that's going to end up in the ocean, you know, as a result.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:31:18):**  So the bottom line is in Chris's research on climate change, the spray foams are at  
**[0:31:26-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:31:26):**  the top of the list and it was convincing enough to make me say, okay, at my firm, we're  
**[0:31:33-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:31:33):**  no longer going to specify any foam products in any project.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:31:39):**  So yeah, I think that's like number one we have to stop using.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:31:45):**  We got to get off the foam.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:31:47):**  We got to start.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:31:49):**  Even if it's just, you know, switching to cellulose or stone wool or, you know, something  
**[0:31:55-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:31:55):**  like that, even fiberglass insulation has a much, much lower carbon footprint and global  
**[0:32:05-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:32:05):**  warming potential than your foams.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:32:08):**  Certainly.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:32:09):**  I just personally always wince whenever someone says fiberglass because I've had so many horrible  
**[0:32:13-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:32:13):**  experiences of working with it.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:32:15):**  It's like I used to work on ships and I tore up like a whole bunch of fiberglass insulation  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:32:20):**  around the exhaust pipes of the engine without any protective gear.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:32:24):**  I was itching for like a week.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:32:26):**  Oddly enough, the only thing that finally got it off was bentonite clay, which I like  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:32:30):**  rubbed all over my arms and let it dry and then washed it off because it just like basically  
**[0:32:35-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:32:35):**  screwed it.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:32:36):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:32:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:32:38):**  But so talking about all those materials that you would caution against, what are some of  
**[0:32:44-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:32:44):**  the materials or techniques that you found success with within renovation projects that  
**[0:32:50-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:32:50):**  you've done or that you would advocate for?  
**[0:32:53-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:32:53):**  Yeah, I mean, a lot of you know, I, I work a lot in the conventional world too, even  
**[0:33:01-0:33:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:33:01):**  though I'm, I'm advocating for, you know, a lot of the alternative methods such as ram  
**[0:33:08-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:33:08):**  dirt and hempcrete.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:33:10):**  But I do a lot of work with just standard conventional materials as well.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:33:16):**  And so even just shifting over to cellulose insulation, it's affordable.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:33:23):**  It works well.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:33:24):**  You know, I think it's a great insulation option.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:33:30):**  And I've worked a little bit with the stone wool insulation, which is not quite as environmentally  
**[0:33:38-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:33:38):**  friendly, but I would still say it's better than fiberglass.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:33:42):**  It's better than spray foam.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:33:44):**  I think that's a nice option.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:33:46):**  It's a bat that just goes between studs.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:33:49):**  It's very rigid, so you can like put it in your roof line and it'll just stay there.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:33:55):**  You know, it doesn't sag, it doesn't droop.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:33:57):**  So I've been really pleased with the performance of stone wool insulation and, and just more  
**[0:34:06-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:34:06):**  plaster work.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:34:11):**  Doing more specifying and applying more lime-based plasters, clay-based paints.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:34:23):**  So a lot more, you know, mineral-based interior finishes.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:34:28):**  There's a great product I've been working with called Limestrong.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:34:35):**  That is Ryan Chivers' product.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:34:37):**  It comes in a bag, add water, the instructions are on their website.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:34:43):**  And so if you have a little bit of trial experience, it's a very nice DIY kind of a method and  
**[0:34:49-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:34:49):**  it can go right over drywall.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:34:53):**  I think on Instagram, they always post really beautiful pictures of the things they do.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:34:57):**  Yeah, their work is gorgeous.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:35:00):**  And Ryan's like an amazing plaster artisan, but he's come up with this great product and  
**[0:35:06-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:35:06):**  it's very user-friendly and it's all natural materials.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:35:09):**  So you know, I think just shift, there's little shifts, you know, away from latex paint to,  
**[0:35:20-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:35:20):**  you know, your more natural mineral-based finishes.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:35:23):**  And I'm finding more and more clients are coming to me because they have chemical sensitivities  
**[0:35:29-0:35:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:35:29):**  or they have a child with extreme asthma or, you know, mold sickness.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:35:36):**  So people are, I believe, experiencing more and more indoor air quality issues.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:35:45):**  And the research shows us that your clay-based, lime-based, natural mineral-based finishes  
**[0:35:54-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:35:54):**  actually can detoxify the air.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:35:56):**  Well, on that note, let's take a little step back and because I think a lot of people aren't  
**[0:36:01-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:36:01):**  aware of the toxins in their homes.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:36:04):**  A lot of people think that, you know, especially if they live in cities, that their interior  
**[0:36:08-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:36:08):**  area is going to be healthier or somehow less polluted than the air outside.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:36:13):**  Whereas that's often not the case.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:36:15):**  Can you help us to identify some of the culprits and things that we should be aware of that  
**[0:36:20-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:36:20):**  need to be identified before we can start to live in healthier interior environments?  
**[0:36:26-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:36:26):**  Right.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:36:27):**  Yeah, well, that's a big topic.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:36:32):**  But we have really put a lot of energy and focus this year on researching indoor air  
**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:36:39):**  quality issues and trying to understand that.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:36:44):**  There are what's called red list chemicals.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:36:47):**  These are known carcinogen chemicals that exist that are on the, I believe, FDA-known  
**[0:36:59-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:36:59):**  carcinogen chemicals that are bad for you.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:37:02):**  And these red list chemicals are in all kinds of building products and materials and furniture.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:37:10):**  So it really, it's overwhelming when you start to read this stuff and look at it and understand  
**[0:37:18-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:37:18):**  that, wow, these chemicals are pretty much in so many things that we just don't even  
**[0:37:27-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:37:27):**  think about or know about.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:37:28):**  I mean, it's information that's there.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:37:31):**  They have to list it.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:37:32):**  They have to print it, but it takes somebody doing that research and really looking at  
**[0:37:37-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:37:37):**  it and recognizing that.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:37:40):**  Yeah, that kind of thing.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:37:41):**  This material has X, Y, and Z.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:37:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:37:44):**  And so, what we're doing at my firm is we have some colleagues that we're working with  
**[0:37:52-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:37:52):**  that are in the green product world.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:37:59):**  So they are the experts on products and materials.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:38:04):**  And so we go to them to help us specify the right things for our interiors.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:38:13):**  And I mean, everything from joint compound on your drywall to the drywall itself, making  
**[0:38:19-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:38:19):**  sure your drywall doesn't have formaldehyde to the sealer that's going on your floor,  
**[0:38:29-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:38:29):**  looking at flooring itself, staying away from a lot of your composites.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:38:38):**  Things that have a lot of glues in it are going to be more toxic.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:38:41):**  You're going to have more of those harmful VOCs and the redless chemicals.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:38:46):**  Unfortunately, the more inexpensive materials are the ones that are also full of toxic stuff,  
**[0:38:54-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:38:54):**  as you can, I'm sure, imagine.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:38:58):**  I think it really just starts with education and awareness.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:39:03):**  We had to educate ourselves first.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:39:06):**  And so what we've done, what we're doing and in the process of doing is putting together  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:39:13):**  interior design packages that are healthy home interior packages.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:39:18):**  So we're getting to where we are able to put together a comprehensive list of materials,  
**[0:39:26-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:39:26):**  everything from your flooring floors to your ceilings to your plumbing fixtures of materials  
**[0:39:35-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:39:35):**  that do not contain any red list chemicals or any of the known harmful VOCs.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:39:43):**  So it's a big task, but that's what our focus is on.  
**[0:39:52-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:39:52):**  And we're really trying to create spaces for people that will result in good indoor air  
**[0:40:00-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:40:00):**  quality.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:40:01):**  For sure.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:40:02):**  Now, if I answered your question.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:40:05):**  No, no, definitely.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:40:06):**  It's a much bigger topic that we can cover just speaking about it offhand.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:40:11):**  There's data in this, there's specific things that you need to look into.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:40:15):**  Even just to be able to read a material safety data sheet is difficult.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:40:18):**  It requires some education.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:40:20):**  But we can definitely point some people to the articles that you've written on your blog.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:40:24):**  And I think I saw one in medium, which I looked at and were very informative.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:40:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:40:29):**  Other resources would you maybe put people in the direction of to find out more for themselves?  
**[0:40:36-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:40:36):**  Let's see.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:40:43):**  We have a lot of resources that I don't unfortunately have right in front of me.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:40:51):**  That's all right.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:40:52):**  I know the trick for this.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:40:53):**  And if you share any of them with me later, I can put them in the show notes for this  
**[0:40:55-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:40:55):**  episode.  
**[0:40:56-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:40:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:57-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:40:57):**  That's what I was thinking.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:40:58):**  But there's some good books out there.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:41:00):**  The problem is because so many new chemicals and products are constantly coming out, I'm  
**[0:41:04-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:41:04):**  always worried that a book that was published five years ago might not be particularly relevant.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:41:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:41:10):**  The product lines that are currently on the market.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:41:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:41:13):**  Well, and the big kind of rule of thumb that we just keep coming back to and becomes so  
**[0:41:20-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:41:20):**  blatantly obvious is that our clays and our lines and our natural minerals are like the  
**[0:41:29-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:41:29):**  best things we can have in our spaces.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:41:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:41:32):**  I mean, it kind of goes without saying, but the more natural your finishes and your wall  
**[0:41:37-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:41:37):**  system, the better that air quality is going to be, the more heavily manufactured and produced  
**[0:41:46-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:41:46):**  and composite materials, plastic and petroleum-based materials, the more toxic you're going to  
**[0:41:53-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:41:53):**  get.  
**[0:41:54-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:41:54):**  So the more you can stay towards your natural woods, your natural grasses and corks and  
**[0:42:03-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:42:03):**  that kind of thing.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:42:04):**  But cork and bamboo you have to look because a lot of those have glues that are added.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:42:09):**  So I would be happy to share with you some of the resources we've been using.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:42:17):**  I can email that to you.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:42:19):**  Sure.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:42:20):**  No worries.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:42:21):**  Just send it out to me whenever you get a chance and I'll make sure that they go on  
**[0:42:23-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:42:23):**  the show notes.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:42:24):**  So in the meantime, can you tell me a little bit about your recommendations for people  
**[0:42:30-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:42:30):**  who are trying to tackle some of these projects on their own?  
**[0:42:34-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:42:34):**  You made it sound like the hempcrete is something that with a bit of education, someone might  
**[0:42:38-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:42:38):**  be able to tackle a smaller project or get some help with and be able to do themselves.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:42:43):**  What about analysis of the health of their home?  
**[0:42:48-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:42:48):**  Yeah, that's, well, you can call us.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:42:54):**  There you go.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:42:57):**  Yeah, I guess it just depends on exactly what you're trying to pinpoint.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:43:07):**  If you think that there might be like a mold kind of an issue, then pinpointing the source  
**[0:43:16-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:43:16):**  of that problem, where the water is coming from, is there water infiltration or is there  
**[0:43:22-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:43:22):**  just a buildup of moisture that's coming from the inside?  
**[0:43:26-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:43:26):**  It's really, a lot of these things are, it's almost like a forensic exploration of trying  
**[0:43:33-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:43:33):**  to figure out what the problem is and where it's coming from.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:43:37):**  What's the root of it?  
**[0:43:38-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:43:38):**  Or if it's just that you're interested in non-toxic materials.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:43:47):**  Again, that just kind of goes back to what I was just saying about avoiding the redless  
**[0:43:55-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:43:55):**  chemicals, avoiding your composites and glue heavy materials.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:44:04):**  But it's, yeah, that's kind of a big question because it's just, I also have.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:44:13):**  There is a lot to consider for sure.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:44:15):**  Yeah, and you know, I do have a great expert that I work with that I call on.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:44:23):**  He is an expert in moisture and mold issues.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:44:27):**  So you know, someone who's experiencing mildews or molds or mustiness or too much moisture,  
**[0:44:38-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:44:38):**  he can come in and begin to figure out, is there a source of entry of the water or is  
**[0:44:46-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:44:46):**  it that the mechanical system's not right?  
**[0:44:48-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:44:48):**  A lot of times our mechanical systems are out of balance and not providing the right  
**[0:44:54-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:44:54):**  kind of airflow and dehumidification that you need.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:45:01):**  And that's again coming back to the issues around spray foam and really vapor impermeable  
**[0:45:13-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:45:13):**  envelopes that we're seeing like your zip systems, your sips panels.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:45:20):**  All of these styrofoam heavy systems are great at insulating the building, but they're not  
**[0:45:28-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:45:28):**  allowing any kind of vapor movement.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:45:31):**  And when that happens, you have to rely completely on your interior mechanical system to provide  
**[0:45:38-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:45:38):**  the right amount of ventilation and dehumidification.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:45:41):**  If you don't have that, then you're going to end up with a buildup of moisture and also  
**[0:45:46-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:45:46):**  toxins.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:45:47):**  I mean, we breathe and we cook and we create moisture and stuff in our homes.  
**[0:45:56-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:45:56):**  And if we're not allowing that moisture to get out of the home properly, and again, I'm  
**[0:46:02-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:46:02):**  speaking from a climate in the Southeast that is moisture rich.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:46:08):**  We have a lot of moisture related issues, so I know that these issues probably aren't  
**[0:46:13-0:46:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:46:13):**  as big in other parts of the country, but these are our issues here.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:46:19):**  But that's what we're seeing is a lot of moldy, musty, failing, brand new custom high-end  
**[0:46:27-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:46:27):**  homes because in a lot of instances, they're just too tight.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:46:33):**  They're too tight and then there's not adequate ventilation on the interior.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:46:39):**  And so it's just a balance.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:46:41):**  You have to look at the whole holistic system and see how is this building going to perform?  
**[0:46:47-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:46:47):**  How do you want it to perform and how does it need to perform?  
**[0:46:51-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:46:51):**  And then making sure that everything is in balance from the wall system to the mechanical  
**[0:46:56-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:46:56):**  system.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:46:57):**  So yeah, it's a pretty, building science is, I love it and I hate it at the same time.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:47:05):**  And it's getting more complicated because of, like you said, all of these new chemicals  
**[0:47:09-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:47:09):**  and materials and things.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:47:11):**  It's not as simple as just, okay, what do I have around me that can hold a roof up and  
**[0:47:16-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:47:16):**  keep the wind out?  
**[0:47:17-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:47:17):**  It's gotten so much more complicated than that.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:47:20):**  And I mean, just like you mentioned a second ago, one of my first reactions when you start  
**[0:47:24-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:47:24):**  to see the popularity of these hyper efficient buildings, everything from passive house to  
**[0:47:30-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:47:30):**  all the retrofits that they're doing for energy efficiency.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:47:33):**  And they talk about things like, oh, you could heat it with a candle or a hairdryer.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:47:36):**  And I'm like, yeah, but there's no air exchange.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:47:40):**  Exactly.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:47:41):**  It's like, it's great that you can save on energy, but if it means that you're in a hermetically  
**[0:47:46-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:47:46):**  sealed building with moisture problems, tons of toxins from all of the new aid or hyper  
**[0:47:54-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:47:54):**  modern chemical heavy industrial materials that are in it, it's like, okay, fine.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:47:59):**  You lower your bill on the energy side, but you just shot your bill up on the healthcare  
**[0:48:05-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:48:05):**  side.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:48:06):**  So you end up paying for it one way or another.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:48:08):**  Yeah, you really have to have a fresh air intake.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:48:11):**  If you're going to have a super sealed up tight home like that, like a Sips home or  
**[0:48:17-0:48:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:48:17):**  an ICF, you know, the styrofoam ICF home, you really have to have a good fresh air supply  
**[0:48:26-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:48:26):**  in your HVAC system.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:48:28):**  Otherwise you can, you can get some pretty nasty results.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:48:31):**  So yeah, you're right.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:48:35):**  It's, it's, it's super complicated and it's like, I'm going to go out on a limb and say  
**[0:48:41-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:48:41):**  I do love brand earth because it's so simple.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:48:44):**  Yeah, I'm going to go out on a limb and say the more that you can live outside or make  
**[0:48:48-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:48:48):**  your home environment like the outdoors.  
**[0:48:51-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:48:51):**  And I mean, there's always problems with that given how damaged the ecosystems many of us  
**[0:48:56-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:48:56):**  live in are now, but still erring on that side of, you know, good ventilation from the  
**[0:49:02-0:49:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:49:02):**  outdoors in a healthier environment.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:49:04):**  And you know, trying not to live in these, these little boxes that are cut off from,  
**[0:49:10-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:49:10):**  from where we should be interacting is probably a good kind of rule of thumb when decisions  
**[0:49:16-0:49:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:49:16):**  like this.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:49:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:49:18):**  And I think a lot too about the labors.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:49:21):**  You know, it's not just about the people who are living in these homes, but the people  
**[0:49:26-0:49:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:49:26):**  who are building with these materials day in, day out for decades, you know, what are  
**[0:49:33-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:49:33):**  they experiencing?  
**[0:49:36-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:49:36):**  What are their, what are their longterm health effects going to be?  
**[0:49:39-0:49:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:49:39):**  You know, yeah, I've thought of that a lot.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:49:41):**  I've worked in the construction trades, especially the industrial trades for much longer than  
**[0:49:44-0:49:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:49:44):**  I was in natural building.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:49:46):**  And when you think about how often you need to wear a respirator and all this protective  
**[0:49:49-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:49:49):**  gear, and it's like, well, if I need to put on all of this to build with this, like these  
**[0:49:54-0:49:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:49:54):**  people are in here all the time.  
**[0:49:56-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:49:56):**  What's that doing to them?  
**[0:49:57-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:49:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:49:58):**  It's like, look at the guys doing the spray foam with the hazmat suits on.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:50:02):**  Oh yeah.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:50:03):**  They look like they're going to space.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:50:05):**  Okay, so within that, before we run on to long April, can you tell our listeners a bit  
**[0:50:13-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:50:13):**  about the educational opportunities that you have coming up and how they can get in touch  
**[0:50:17-0:50:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:50:17):**  with you for more information?  
**[0:50:19-0:50:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:50:19):**  Sure.  
**[0:50:22-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:50:22):**  So unfortunately I don't have any workshops scheduled currently.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:50:29):**  It is something I'm trying to ramp up in 2020.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:50:37):**  And that's something we're working on actually is how to respond to this growing need and  
**[0:50:44-0:50:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:50:44):**  this growing demand of education.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:50:49):**  But currently the only class I'm leading right now is with my students at the American College  
**[0:50:57-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:50:57):**  of Building Arts.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:50:59):**  And then outside of that, you can always reach us through our website, rootdowndesigns.com.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:51:09):**  We're on Instagram and Facebook.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:51:12):**  We do have some blogs that we published this year on Medium that are just under my name,  
**[0:51:21-0:51:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:51:21):**  April McGill.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:51:22):**  You can also find those links on our website.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:51:26):**  So we're trying to get more just informative information out there when and where we can.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:51:34):**  And I'm also doing more presentations and speaking gigs to different groups and trying  
**[0:51:42-0:51:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:51:42):**  to educate that way, even at the city level.  
**[0:51:47-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:51:47):**  I've been speaking with our city government officials about these issues so that we can  
**[0:51:53-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:51:53):**  hopefully start to make changes in public housing and low income housing.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:52:03):**  So yes, the demand for information and education I see is growing and it's something that we  
**[0:52:12-0:52:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:52:12):**  are trying to figure out how to respond to it.  
**[0:52:15-0:52:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:52:15):**  So we are making plans in 2020 to be able to offer more ongoing classes and workshops  
**[0:52:22-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:52:22):**  on rammed earth, on hempcrete.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:52:26):**  There's another product we're working with, faswall block, which is a more natural ICF  
**[0:52:31-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:52:31):**  block.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:52:32):**  So those three methods, I hope to be able to offer ongoing classes next year in 2020  
**[0:52:42-0:52:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:52:42):**  around those three methods and then the occasional plaster and finish kind of work.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:52:50):**  But yeah, just reach out, send us an email, shoot us a message on social media if there's  
**[0:52:59-0:53:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:52:59):**  something specific that you are wanting information on.  
**[0:53:06-0:53:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:53:06):**  We offer consulting services.  
**[0:53:12-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:53:12):**  I'm constantly continuing to learn from Chris.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:53:15):**  I'm actually going to Canada in a couple weeks to meet with him for a little bit so I can  
**[0:53:20-0:53:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:53:20):**  soak up more of his knowledge.  
**[0:53:25-0:53:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:53:25):**  And so trying to find more and more avenues and ways to get the information out there.  
**[0:53:32-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:53:32):**  And I think the more people know, then the more we can start to make these changes.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:53:38):**  And what I'm seeing is a role within the past year, I've seen a pretty big shift.  
**[0:53:46-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:53:46):**  I think there's a level of awareness and action that people are ready to take.  
**[0:53:52-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:53:52):**  Whereas before, I think a lot of this stuff has been sounded cool, but not really didn't  
**[0:53:58-0:54:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:53:58):**  seem attainable to a lot of people.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:54:00):**  And now what I'm seeing are people who are ready to take action and they're ready to  
**[0:54:06-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:54:06):**  sort of make that shift away from these conventional materials that we've been so accustomed to  
**[0:54:16-0:54:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:54:16):**  using.  
**[0:54:17-0:54:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:54:17):**  So yeah, we're just going to keep trying to get more and more info out there.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:54:23):**  And then we're trying to offer more and more easy to access information.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:54:28):**  So we've launched a series of small healthy home stock plans this year.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:54:37):**  Oh yeah, I saw those.  
**[0:54:39-0:54:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:54:39):**  Those look great.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:54:40):**  Pre-engineered, highly detailed house plans for small, efficient, healthy homes.  
**[0:54:48-0:54:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:54:48):**  So we're building up that inventory, but that's something that you can just, it's available,  
**[0:54:56-0:54:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:54:56):**  it's ready to purchase.  
**[0:54:57-0:55:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:54:57):**  And then also on our interiors, we've put together an e-package for purchase.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:55:06):**  So healthy homes, healthy interiors, e-download.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:55:11):**  So we're trying to create more and more information that's just easy to access from our website.  
**[0:55:19-0:55:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:55:19):**  If you don't have the time or the money for custom consulting or custom architectural  
**[0:55:28-0:55:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:55:28):**  services, which many of us don't.  
**[0:55:32-0:55:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:55:32):**  So yeah, we're trying to respond to average folks who need solutions, but can't necessarily  
**[0:55:43-0:55:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:55:43):**  afford custom architectural services and interior design.  
**[0:55:48-0:55:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:55:48):**  For sure.  
**[0:55:49-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:55:49):**  Yeah, that's a really necessary resource.  
**[0:55:51-0:55:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:55:51):**  And I really think people like you and like Chris, who are doing all that legwork, doing  
**[0:55:57-0:56:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:55:57):**  the heavy research, working with local municipalities and governments and putting together educational  
**[0:56:03-0:56:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:56:03):**  material that really help folks get informed about their options and what is going to work  
**[0:56:09-0:56:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:56:09):**  best for them and improve their lives.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:56:10):**  So I'm going to make sure to...  
**[0:56:12-0:56:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:56:12):**  And it's going to take an army.  
**[0:56:13-0:56:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:56:13):**  We're going to need people over.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:56:15):**  So if you're interested and you want to help, contact us.  
**[0:56:19-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:56:19):**  I'll see what I can put together from over here.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:56:22):**  Now that I'm located in Spain, I'm figuring out what the regulations and environment here  
**[0:56:29-0:56:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:56:29):**  are like before I start making any bigger plans, but I'm definitely going to be offering  
**[0:56:33-0:56:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:56:33):**  some more educational programs in the future too.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:56:37):**  Awesome.  
**[0:56:38-0:56:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:56:38):**  Cool.  
**[0:56:39-0:56:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:56:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:56:40):**  All right.  
**[0:56:41-0:56:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:56:41):**  So I'll make sure to link to all of those articles that you mentioned.  
**[0:56:42-0:56:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:56:42):**  And if anybody's interested in listening to Chris's podcast, I'll put a link to that as  
**[0:56:47-0:56:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:56:47):**  well.  
**[0:56:48-0:56:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:56:48):**  And you can get information like April was mentioning on the details of certain types  
**[0:56:53-0:56:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:56:53):**  of materials and techniques.  
**[0:56:55-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:56:55):**  And yeah, it was really great to talk to you again.  
**[0:56:57-0:56:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:56:57):**  Let's try and do another session before too long.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:56:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:00-0:57:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:57:00):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:57:01-0:57:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:57:01):**  Thanks Oliver.  
**[0:57:02-0:57:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:57:02):**  It's my pleasure.  
**[0:57:03-0:57:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:57:03):**  And thanks for all of your work in helping to spread this info.

**[0:57:07-0:57:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:57:07):**  All right.  
**[0:57:08-0:57:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:57:08):**  Take care.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:57:09):**  I'll talk to you soon.  
**[0:57:10-0:57:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-april-magill/#t=0:57:10):**  All right.

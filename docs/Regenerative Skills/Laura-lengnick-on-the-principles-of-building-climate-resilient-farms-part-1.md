**[0:00:08-0:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:00:08):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:00:10):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:00:13):**  Hey everybody, and welcome back.  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:00:17):**  It's been a wild couple of weeks for me, and as a result, I am struggling a little bit  
**[0:00:22-0:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:00:22):**  to catch up.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:00:23):**  I recently wrapped up the 5-day Regenerative Design course at the Green Rebel Farm in Miravec,  
**[0:00:28-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:00:28):**  Spain.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:00:29):**  And then the 3-day Climate Farming Conference at Schloss Kirchberg in Germany.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:00:35):**  And now I'm on a short break visiting the small farm of a good friend of mine in Dessau  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:00:39):**  between events helping out with an agroforestry design.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:00:43):**  Before then, a week-long team retreat with the climate farmers team in Brandenburg.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:00:47):**  Then of course, when I get back, I've got tree planting events lined up in the Pyrenees.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:00:52):**  And then I'll be facilitating a course in Tuscany on restoring hydrological function  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:00:56):**  to the landscape with Zach Weiss and Lorenzo Costa.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:01:00):**  So maybe by the end of November, things will calm down in time for my partner and I to  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:01:05):**  actually move into our new property, which we were finally able to sign the papers on  
**[0:01:09-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:01:09):**  after a year of paper and admin work.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:01:12):**  So all of that is to say that, though I've got plenty of great interviews lined up for  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:01:17):**  you, I might be a little bit irregular in releasing the episodes over this next month.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:01:22):**  But enough about me.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:01:24):**  This week, I am thrilled to present the first in a two-part series exploring the topic of  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:01:29):**  building true resilience in agriculture.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:01:33):**  Resilience is often thought of as the ability to bounce back from a disturbance or challenge.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:01:38):**  But in these two episodes, we're going to dig deeper and not only broaden the theory  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:01:42):**  of true resilience, but also look into case studies of growers and land stewards who are  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:01:47):**  building lasting resilience on their farms.

**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:01:54):**  even those that don't work directly with the land can use in our lives.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:01:59):**  I had a wonderful conversation with Laura Legnick.

**[0:04:32-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:04:32):**  It's such a pleasure to finally get to speak to you.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:04:34):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:04:35-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:04:35):**  How are things in New York?  
**[0:04:36-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:04:36):**  I'm doing great this morning.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:04:38):**  We're in and things are good in New York.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:04:41):**  We are in sort of the most beautiful part of the fall season.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:04:46):**  So the leaves are just glowing out there.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:04:50):**  All our livestock here and our vegetables too actually are fat and happy.  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:04:56):**  And pastures are looking great.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:04:58):**  So yeah, doing well here.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:05:01):**  Oh, that's so good to hear.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:05:02):**  I know so many farmers have had a really tough season.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:05:05):**  I'm so glad to hear a story of someone's land and livestock doing really well at the moment.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:05:10):**  Plus the fall colors.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:05:11):**  I mean, that's what upstate New York is famous for, right?  
**[0:05:15-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:05:15):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:05:17):**  And just to add a little more richness to my positive report, we were in an extreme  
**[0:05:23-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:05:23):**  drought this summer.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:05:26):**  And it's been amazing to watch.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:05:28):**  We had literally almost three months with no rain at all and really several heat waves.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:05:37):**  And our pastures, the way that folks described it here, and I agree, was it looked like California  
**[0:05:43-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:05:43):**  in the dry season.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:05:45):**  Our pastures were utterly brown or yellow.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:05:49):**  It was incredible.  
**[0:05:52-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:05:52):**  And then the rain started and it was so satisfying to watch our land just respond to that rain.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:06:02):**  And that's an example for me of the resilience of regenerative grazing in this case.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:06:08):**  We do intensive grazing on all of our farm.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:06:12):**  On our farm, we have about 80 acres or so of pastures that have been intensively grazed  
**[0:06:18-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:06:18):**  now for many years.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:06:21):**  So really right here, right now, we watched the landscape come back when the rain started  
**[0:06:30-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:06:30):**  again.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:06:31):**  So that's got a lot to do with why I'm so upbeat at the moment.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:06:34):**  If we'd been talking maybe in mid-August, I'd be wondering how things are going.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:06:40):**  Oh man, I can imagine.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:06:42):**  Well, that's really good to hear.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:06:43):**  And we're definitely going to explore deeper into these systems and techniques for resilience.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:06:49):**  But let's start at the beginning.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:06:51):**  Or could you tell me how you got into farming in the beginning?  
**[0:06:55-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:06:55):**  Is this something that you have a history of in your family or did you come into it  
**[0:06:58-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:06:58):**  later in life?  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:06:59):**  I have a history of my family.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:07:03):**  I came into it, I think, as an undergraduate at university.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:07:09):**  And I was a suburban kid.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:07:13):**  My family's story and my own path to agriculture, very common in the US.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:07:19):**  My grandparents were farmers.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:07:22):**  And they grew up on farms.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:07:25):**  And they left the farm as soon as they could and went to the city.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:07:30):**  And then my parents and then myself, we were all raised to not think about farming as an  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:07:39):**  option for a career.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:07:42):**  And I was actually studying how I got to this specifically.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:07:46):**  I was studying landscape architecture.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:07:49):**  So you can see, or when I look back, I can see that I already was really interested in  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:07:54):**  land and plants.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:07:56):**  And from my upbringing, the only option really was to go into landscape architecture.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:08:04):**  Got into that program in college, took a soils course as part of that program and never looked  
**[0:08:10-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:08:10):**  back.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:08:11):**  It really, and I've never regretted that.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:08:15):**  Working in soils, working in agriculture and food systems just ticked all of my boxes in  
**[0:08:21-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:08:21):**  terms of feel interesting work, never always satisfying, and also feels really, has always  
**[0:08:32-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:08:32):**  felt to me really useful and important work as well.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:08:37):**  And how has that led you into all the different hats that you wear now?  
**[0:08:41-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:08:41):**  Because farming is just one of them, right?  
**[0:08:43-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:08:43):**  Yes.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:08:44):**  So when I said farming, I was thinking about it.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:08:47):**  So where I ended up in my early career was going through a master's and PhD program and  
**[0:08:55-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:08:55):**  getting involved in very early on in organic farming research.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:09:02):**  So I became a soil science researcher, cropping systems researcher.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:09:07):**  So wasn't farming in that early part of my career.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:09:15):**  And eventually got into doing more education, research, education.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:09:26):**  And then during that time in my career, really wanted to try farming.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:09:33):**  I felt like it was really important to any other work that I did to actually have an  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:09:38):**  experience farming.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:09:41):**  And so I got involved in a small farming operation and did grew vegetables and had some livestock  
**[0:09:51-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:09:51):**  for a small CSA.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:09:53):**  At that time, I was in the Southern Appalachians based in Asheville, North Carolina.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:09:59):**  And so I had that experience as well of just working in the season and working to feed  
**[0:10:08-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:10:08):**  people very well.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:10:11):**  I was always drawn to that.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:10:13):**  But when I actually did it, it made it gave me all the experiences I thought it would  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:10:20):**  in terms of just enriching all the other work that I've done, the policy work, the research  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:10:25):**  work, education work, active activist work.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:10:29):**  So it was a really important time in my career and has really helped to shape me from then  
**[0:10:37-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:10:37):**  on.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:10:38):**  So, yeah, that's what I can share about that.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:10:43):**  That's really beautiful.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:10:44):**  And I'm sure there's a lot of people who now take care of and steward land that feel the  
**[0:10:49-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:10:49):**  same way through their own experiences.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:10:51):**  Yet, I'm wondering in this time that you've been working in this field and helping out  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:10:57):**  other people who manage land, take care of soil, you've probably seen firsthand all of  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:11:03):**  the changes that are happening at the moment, not only in the economics of farming, but  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:11:08):**  also the weather and the climactic changes that have been happening in the last handful  
**[0:11:13-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:11:13):**  of decades, especially severely.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:11:16):**  How has that affected the growers that you work with and your own farm, much like you  
**[0:11:20-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:11:20):**  alluded to a little earlier?  
**[0:11:22-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:11:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:11:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:11:24):**  So I have made asking this question, how is climate change affecting farming a major part  
**[0:11:35-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:11:35):**  of my work, my professional work over the last decade or so, a little bit more than  
**[0:11:42-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:11:42):**  that.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:11:43):**  And so I've talked with a lot of farmers as well as worked in policy or with policymakers  
**[0:11:52-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:11:52):**  and educators to explore together what it means to farm in a changing climate.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:12:01):**  In more recent years, I really appreciate the language that the regenerative movement  
**[0:12:08-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:12:08):**  brought into this space of agricultural climate solutions and thinking about how agriculture  
**[0:12:17-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:12:17):**  absolutely is contributing.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:12:19):**  I think it's unfair.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:12:21):**  I don't appreciate saying agriculture is contributing to climate change.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:12:26):**  I like to think about it as the way we eat is contributing to climate change and agriculture  
**[0:12:33-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:12:33):**  can be a solution to part of the solution to climate change.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:12:39):**  So that to me, that's a very powerful way to frame the issues.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:12:46):**  And so over the last little bit more than a decade, I've actually traveled around the  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:12:52):**  US and interviewed farmers all over the country.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:12:57):**  I've also done taught or led different workshops around the country with farmers to find out,  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:13:05):**  you know, to help them come up with or develop a climate risk management plan.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:13:10):**  So, yes, I have been in the company of many, many farmers by now and also technical advice  
**[0:13:18-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:13:18):**  staff.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:13:19):**  So the folks that go out and provide technical and financial advice to farmers about how  
**[0:13:24-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:13:24):**  to adapt or reduce the risks of more variable weather to their operations.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:13:33):**  And what I'm hearing, what I've heard, and it's been very consistent over the time that  
**[0:13:39-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:13:39):**  I've done this work, is that more variable weather and extreme weather events are absolutely  
**[0:13:46-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:13:46):**  stretching farmers in this country.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:13:49):**  And certainly any reports I've read, farmer stories from any other country around the  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:13:54):**  world, no matter sort of the type of agriculture or the economic system they're in.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:14:00):**  I mean, that's a very consistent story.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:14:04):**  One thing that I think is interesting and I really appreciate about the fact that I  
**[0:14:11-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:14:11):**  got into this so early is that when I first started working on climate and ag issues,  
**[0:14:20-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:14:20):**  I had to begin every presentation or every interview, every engagement of whatever kind  
**[0:14:27-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:14:27):**  I was doing with a short justification about the fact that climate change is happening.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:14:39):**  And in those early years, very common to have people question why I was doing this.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:14:49):**  Why are we even thinking about adapting to climate change?  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:14:54):**  And over the time, things have really shifted.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:14:58):**  And in particular, I'd say in the last two to three years in the U.S., the government  
**[0:15:07-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:15:07):**  has finally come along, come along with this idea.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:15:13):**  And I'm very excited about the potential moving forward.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:15:18):**  We really have got business and government and all sorts of sort of the nonprofit sector,  
**[0:15:26-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:15:26):**  public interest sector.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:15:28):**  Everyone is now on board with this idea that agriculture can be a source of solutions,  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:15:34):**  as well as it's a source of some of the challenges of climate change.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:15:39):**  And I'm really looking forward to the future.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:15:44):**  And the last thing I'll say is and that is so satisfying because I think it's rare in  
**[0:15:49-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:15:49):**  these kinds of this kind of a space for at least I'll put it this way.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:15:57):**  It's rare in my experience to have the satisfaction of sort of starting out as as one of the few  
**[0:16:03-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:16:03):**  folks talking about this and then actually seeing a real change happen in the space.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:16:10):**  So I feel very grateful to have still be doing this work in this time.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:16:17):**  Laura, you were doing it before it was cool.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:16:19):**  Good for you.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:16:20):**  Really, I'm sure had a role in helping get these discussions on more of a common platform  
**[0:16:27-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:16:27):**  and more well recognized.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:16:29):**  And I'm wondering, too, how you have seen the difference or the change in the way that  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:16:33):**  farmers and growers are talking about this issue.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:16:37):**  Not only is it more accepted, but I would imagine they've been given more vocabulary  
**[0:16:41-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:16:41):**  and ways of articulating exactly how it's affecting them.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:16:44):**  How have you seen that change?  
**[0:16:47-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:16:47):**  I have seen some change in that among growers.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:16:50):**  I think that there's definitely been advance in language.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:16:57):**  For example, a lot of the work that I do is has been really focused on providing new language  
**[0:17:04-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:17:04):**  for growers and farmers just to help clarify what's going on and what we can do about it.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:17:14):**  But I hesitated there and answering the question, because I do think that the farming community  
**[0:17:21-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:17:21):**  more generally still has not accepted the fact that this is a moving target.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:17:29):**  It's not that we I hear a lot of discussion in agricultural community or farming community  
**[0:17:34-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:17:34):**  about, you know, there's a new normal and we have to adjust to the new normal when,  
**[0:17:41-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:17:41):**  in fact, I think I think it would be more useful for farmers and anyone who is interested  
**[0:17:48-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:17:48):**  in sustaining farming to recognize that climate change, that these weather changes that are  
**[0:17:58-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:17:58):**  affecting farmers are going to get more difficult to manage, at least through the middle of  
**[0:18:05-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:18:05):**  this century.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:18:06):**  And so we need something more than or I think it would serve farmers and everyone that depends  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:18:13):**  on them much better if we recognize that it's not about adjusting to a new normal.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:18:19):**  It's about adjusting to a changing weather patterns that are going to get more intense  
**[0:18:25-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:18:25):**  and more difficult to manage.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:18:28):**  It'll be more difficult to manage farming as we go, at least through the middle of this  
**[0:18:33-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:18:33):**  century and probably beyond, because really the global community hasn't acted to slow  
**[0:18:41-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:18:41):**  down emissions.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:18:42):**  So, you know, that's the reality and that's sobering.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:18:47):**  But I also think that we do have tools in agriculture to manage those increased risks  
**[0:18:55-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:18:55):**  and improve the well-being of farmers and the land and the communities that they serve  
**[0:19:01-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:19:01):**  over time.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:19:02):**  And that's really the whole point of my book, Resilient Agriculture, Cultivating Food Systems  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:19:10):**  for a Changing Climate.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:19:14):**  It was important to me to look for or what I did early on in this work was I immediately  
**[0:19:21-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:19:21):**  as once I understood the implications of climate change to food and agriculture, my impulse  
**[0:19:31-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:19:31):**  was to go out and begin to collect tools that farmers and others could use to manage this  
**[0:19:40-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:19:40):**  increasing risk and hey, while we're at it, why don't we actually increase the health  
**[0:19:49-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:19:49):**  of land people and community?  
**[0:19:50-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:19:50):**  Because we're going to need it.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:19:51):**  We're going to need to be more healthy in order to be resilient to these changes.  
**[0:19:56-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:19:56):**  And I'm happy to say I found a lot of existing tools.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:19:59):**  There's a lot of great ideas out there and about managing for health, about managing  
**[0:20:09-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:20:09):**  for resilience, which provides some protection from both expected and unexpected disruptions  
**[0:20:18-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:20:18):**  and shocks.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:20:19):**  And a lot of that work has been done in the past and I think it just we didn't need it  
**[0:20:26-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:20:26):**  or there was a sense that it wasn't that important in past decades.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:20:34):**  But it turns out that it's really useful now.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:20:37):**  And so to go back to what you were saying, that this isn't an adjustment to a new normal.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:20:44):**  Rather than adapting their management techniques to catch up to where we're currently at, the  
**[0:20:49-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:20:49):**  idea is to get ahead of them and preempt them, I would imagine.  
**[0:20:52-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:20:52):**  And so with a view towards the coming decades, what should growers, farmers be aware of and  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:21:00):**  what are some of the things that they need to take account of in order to get ahead of  
**[0:21:06-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:21:06):**  the changes that are coming?  
**[0:21:08-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:21:08):**  Yeah, well, I think we can actually use what farmers are already already experiencing and  
**[0:21:16-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:21:16):**  describing.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:21:17):**  And I think the biggest challenge, the biggest challenge ahead right now in terms of climate  
**[0:21:24-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:21:24):**  or weather challenges is too is too much and not enough water at the same time in the same  
**[0:21:34-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:21:34):**  season.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:21:36):**  That's a fairly unusual challenge in agriculture.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:21:41):**  And so in terms of what we're dealing with now, that's a really important piece of the  
**[0:21:48-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:21:48):**  challenge puzzle for future or what they want to what I recommend that farmers think about  
**[0:21:55-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:21:55):**  in coming years is just to know that that challenge is going to get more intense.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:22:01):**  So important now to begin to think about how to manage your landscape, maybe how to shape  
**[0:22:08-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:22:08):**  your land, how to create redundant sources of water, for example, for those dry periods  
**[0:22:19-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:22:19):**  and for the wet periods, how to manage or shape your land to handle intense rainfall  
**[0:22:26-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:22:26):**  and all the high surface water runoff that can happen in those kinds of rainfalls.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:22:33):**  So think about managing your land to first accept and soak in as much rainfall as you  
**[0:22:41-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:22:41):**  can and then also to suggest to the runoff that does happen where it might go in order  
**[0:22:51-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:22:51):**  to reduce or in order to reduce possible damage from runoff and flooding.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:22:58):**  I think I think a third point around this, a third general strategy around this issue  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:23:06):**  of too much and not enough water is to begin thinking about how you're going to retreat  
**[0:23:11-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:23:11):**  from floodplains.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:23:13):**  Pretty clear.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:23:14):**  It's beginning to it's a it's a common, more general climate change adaptation strategy,  
**[0:23:21-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:23:21):**  from floodplains.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:23:22):**  And I think that agriculture is going to want to adopt that strategy as well.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:23:28):**  And that's pretty tricky for agriculture because some of the best agricultural land are those  
**[0:23:33-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:23:33):**  bottom what we call bottom lands in the US.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:23:36):**  But those those relatively flat, relatively fertile floodplain soils.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:23:47):**  But those those positions in the landscape are going to become increasingly risky.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:23:53):**  They're going to be damaged more often.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:23:55):**  And so operations, agricultural operations will have to think about retreating from those  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:24:02):**  lands.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:24:04):**  So those are those are just a few.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:24:07):**  I'd say general ideas about the strategies that farmers who are going to be successful  
**[0:24:15-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:24:15):**  in coming years are going to have to think about.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:24:17):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:24:18):**  And that covers some basic stuff.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:24:20):**  But the applications may look very different on specific farms.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:24:24):**  And before we go into more detail about this, I would love to know your own definition of  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:24:29):**  resilience and the one the definition that frames the book that you wrote.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:24:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:24:36):**  Um, simply put, my definition of resilience, which is rooted in social ecological resilience  
**[0:24:44-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:24:44):**  science.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:24:45):**  So there are lots of there are several different parallel scientific disciplines that have  
**[0:24:53-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:24:53):**  all been developing resilience ideas around resilience, concepts and language and tools  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:25:00):**  to manage, to measure and manage resilience.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:25:04):**  But the every everything that I talk about in the book and all of my work is rooted in  
**[0:25:09-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:25:09):**  social ecological resilience.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:25:11):**  And that's because social ecological resilience actually focuses on parts of our communities  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:25:21):**  where humans and land are intimately interacting.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:25:26):**  So to me, that fits agriculture pretty well.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:25:30):**  And some of the other ways that folks are talking about thinking about resilience, they  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:25:35):**  really are not a very good fit with agriculture.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:25:40):**  So my definition of resilience rooted in social ecological science is that resilience describes  
**[0:25:51-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:25:51):**  a quality or behavior of a system like a farm to be able to respond to disturbance in ways  
**[0:26:01-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:26:01):**  that reduce the potential for damage to recover when there is damage from quickly and at low  
**[0:26:09-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:26:09):**  cost.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:26:11):**  And the most important piece is to recognize when change is needed and to start making  
**[0:26:20-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:26:20):**  those changes in preparation for the future.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:26:23):**  So that's the transformation.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:26:24):**  So there's there's three nice buckets or containers for those three ideas to respond, to recover  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:26:32):**  or to transform, begin transforming.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:26:37):**  And I just gave you the names for those.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:26:41):**  So I love that.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:26:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:26:44):**  And I think what's what's as I see the landscape of resilience thinking at the moment, I think  
**[0:26:52-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:26:52):**  what's really different about this definition is that most people, when they speak about  
**[0:26:58-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:26:58):**  resilience, are thinking about those first two response and recovery.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:27:04):**  It's the it's the framing is we need to protect what we have now.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:27:10):**  And if it's damaged, we want to build it back, you know, and at best in the U.S., we think  
**[0:27:16-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:27:16):**  about building back better, which is which is absolutely an improvement over just building  
**[0:27:22-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:27:22):**  back.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:27:24):**  But the piece that often gets left out of the discussion of resilience is this idea  
**[0:27:30-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:27:30):**  of transformation, this idea that we know enough now to begin to shift how we're doing  
**[0:27:40-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:27:40):**  agriculture.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:27:41):**  And I just gave you several examples of that in thinking about that too much, not enough  
**[0:27:45-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:27:45):**  water.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:27:46):**  You know, how do we how do we transform agricultural landscapes to make them better at soaking  
**[0:27:54-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:27:54):**  up and storing heavy rain, at being resilient to or being tolerant to drought?  
**[0:28:04-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:28:04):**  And how do we transform landscapes to begin to shape where water moves, excess water moves  
**[0:28:10-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:28:10):**  across the landscape and think about how we can store up that water as well, stop it from  
**[0:28:16-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:28:16):**  causing damage from runoff and turn it into a benefit to farm and also the communities  
**[0:28:24-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:28:24):**  downstream.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:28:25):**  So those are all examples of transformation, specific practices that I see particularly  
**[0:28:33-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:28:33):**  becoming useful in coming years.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:28:35):**  Again, around this too much, not enough water and also rising temperatures, more frequent  
**[0:28:43-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:28:43):**  and intense storms.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:28:45):**  So sort of a classic example of our practice would be agroforestry.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:28:51):**  So many aspects of agroforestry specifically address these these risks associated with  
**[0:28:59-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:28:59):**  too much not enough water and also more intense extreme events.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:29:05):**  Yeah, I'll stop there and we can get more into the weeds there if you'd like.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:29:10):**  Yeah, those are fantastic examples.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:29:14):**  And in order to be able to break things down to exactly how this might look on a given  
**[0:29:19-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:29:19):**  piece of land or in a specific business, I'll use perhaps a term that you've elected for  
**[0:29:26-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:29:26):**  your own book, which is sensitivities.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:29:29):**  How can we break down by specific sensitivities and with the knowledge of those sensitivities  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:29:34):**  create resilience on the land and in the business?  
**[0:29:38-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:29:38):**  Yeah, well, the idea of sensitivities is just really climate vulnerability or you can think  
**[0:29:46-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:29:46):**  of it as as climate resilient in order to tease out the details on your own farm about  
**[0:29:55-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:29:55):**  your your that specific local vulnerability to climate change to weather changes related  
**[0:30:02-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:30:02):**  to climate change.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:30:05):**  There's this there are these three parts.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:30:07):**  There's exposure, sensitivity and then adaptive capacity.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:30:13):**  And so you're bringing up sensitivity.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:30:15):**  Here is the kind of weather that you experience in your place.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:30:20):**  So it starts to get very specific and it has to be very specific.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:30:24):**  I think that's one of the the challenges to our to modern culture in the idea of resilience,  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:30:35):**  because we can't have one size fits all.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:30:39):**  There's no silver bullet.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:30:40):**  It really takes engagement in the local to be able to successfully design for resilience.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:30:51):**  So that's that's tricky for a lot of the way we think about agriculture.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:30:56):**  However, to get back to it, so we have we have exposures which are just the weather.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:31:01):**  So that sensitivity piece is incredibly important because it what it means is it invites you  
**[0:31:09-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:31:09):**  to take a look at your landscape, your crop mix, your livestock and figure out which of  
**[0:31:16-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:31:16):**  the many climate change, weather related climate change effects are going to likely to create  
**[0:31:24-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:31:24):**  the most disruption on your farm.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:31:28):**  That's what this idea of sensitivity is.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:31:30):**  You can use that word the way a good way to think of it is that you can ask the question,  
**[0:31:36-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:31:36):**  what is most sensitive on my farm to drought or to flooding or to wind or to high temperatures  
**[0:31:44-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:31:44):**  in the summer?  
**[0:31:46-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:31:46):**  And so you can begin to and you just work through a catalog of the assets on your farm,  
**[0:31:53-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:31:53):**  the crops, the livestock, the buildings.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:31:56):**  And figure out, for example, which parts of your farm are particularly sensitive to heavy  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:32:03):**  rain or flooding and so on.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:32:07):**  And you just move through and you're basically taking an inventory.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:32:13):**  What's on your farm?  
**[0:32:14-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:32:14):**  What are those?  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:32:17):**  What are the highest risks or most important risks, weather related risk on your farm?  
**[0:32:23-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:32:23):**  So that's the idea of sensitivity.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:32:26):**  And really, it's you're putting together that exposure.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:32:30):**  What kind of weather sensitivity?  
**[0:32:32-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:32:32):**  What on my farm?  
**[0:32:34-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:32:34):**  How will my farm respond to that particular weather event?  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:32:40):**  And so that's kind of the bad news or I think of it as sobering news, you know, but to go  
**[0:32:45-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:32:45):**  through and carefully take a look at that really important.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:32:49):**  And then you get to the good news, which is and how do I reduce risk or enhance the capacity  
**[0:32:55-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:32:55):**  of my farm to respond in ways that that a limit that avoid or reduce damage?  
**[0:33:05-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:33:05):**  Or how do I create a farm that if there is damage, I can recover swiftly and at low cost?  
**[0:33:13-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:33:13):**  So then we get back into that idea of response, recovery and transformation.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:33:18):**  Let's go right into that, then.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:33:21):**  Let's talk about how you can build adaptive capacity.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:33:26):**  What does that look like for different types of growers?  
**[0:33:29-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:33:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:33:30):**  So what that looks like is pretty much what many folks are now calling regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:33:39):**  And given the length of time I've been working in agriculture, there have been other names  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:33:45):**  for it, conservation, agriculture, sustainable agriculture, organic agriculture.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:33:51):**  And that's all good.  
**[0:33:54-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:33:54):**  When I said earlier, you know, when I started to look for tools that farmers could use to  
**[0:34:00-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:34:00):**  manage the effects of climate change, and I said I found a lot of good ideas that have  
**[0:34:07-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:34:07):**  already been developed, it was in all of those kinds of agriculture that I found those ideas.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:34:13):**  So I'm comfortable with regenerative ag as the box or the container for these ideas.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:34:22):**  I think in the U.S. particularly and perhaps in Europe as well, I believe regenerative  
**[0:34:28-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:34:28):**  is going to shift to climate smart.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:34:32):**  But whatever the label, I think it's pretty clear, and I discussed this in the book, that  
**[0:34:39-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:34:39):**  no matter what you call it, it's actually a fairly small group of practices that we  
**[0:34:44-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:34:44):**  know will build resilience on farms.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:34:48):**  And so some of the kind of poster, you know, high level practices to build resilience or  
**[0:34:57-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:34:57):**  to cultivate resilience on farms is reduced tillage, cover crops.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:35:04):**  I mean, all these are going to sound very, very familiar, I think, to your listeners.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:35:13):**  But reduced tillage, cover crops, intensive grazing.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:35:18):**  That's where you move animals around your landscape in some kind of pattern that improves  
**[0:35:24-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:35:24):**  the health of the pastures.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:35:28):**  Microforestry, that's a pretty good set of the four main practices that farmers can use.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:35:37):**  I mean, there are some other ones that are less commonly applicable to farming, to farm  
**[0:35:48-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:35:48):**  systems like reducing methane emissions from dairy farms.  
**[0:35:55-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:35:55):**  And so we've got some other, there's other stuff out there, too.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:35:59):**  It's not just four practices.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:36:00):**  But I think for today, we can really focus on that as those are, that's a good list,  
**[0:36:06-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:36:06):**  or the beginnings of what I call a climate resilience toolbox.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:36:11):**  So those are kind of natural resource practices.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:36:15):**  But it turns out that there's a lot of management practices which really speak to the human  
**[0:36:20-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:36:20):**  side of agriculture and how humans manage landscapes that are also particularly useful  
**[0:36:26-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:36:26):**  to build resilience.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:36:28):**  And what this means is that farmers are going to have to change the way they think about  
**[0:36:34-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:36:34):**  managing their farms.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:36:36):**  And for any of us, not just farmers, changing the way you think can be a heavy lift sometime.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:36:43):**  But we have tools.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:36:44):**  There are tools to help all of us actually change the way we think.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:36:49):**  And they, a really rich set of tools resides in this type of management, a management strategy  
**[0:36:56-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:36:56):**  called holistic management.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:36:59):**  And sometimes it's called whole farm planning.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:37:02):**  And the power of whole farm planning or holistic management, particularly in this setting,  
**[0:37:09-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:37:09):**  or particularly when you're thinking about resilient agriculture, is that it takes you,  
**[0:37:16-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:37:16):**  it's a adaptive management strategy.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:37:20):**  It takes you through a series of steps that help you articulate high level goals.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:37:28):**  So not I want to be a farmer, but instead what I want my life to be and how the farm  
**[0:37:34-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:37:34):**  can help me achieve those life goals, right?  
**[0:37:38-0:37:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:37:38):**  It takes you through that into looking at the assets you have available to help you  
**[0:37:45-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:37:45):**  reach that life goal.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:37:48):**  And in that part of looking at assets is where the thinking about exposures, sensitivities,  
**[0:37:57-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:37:57):**  adaptive capacity come in.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:37:58):**  You put a plan into action and then, and this is a critical piece that I think in coming  
**[0:38:04-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:38:04):**  years we will all need to do better, monitor the response of your system as you move forward.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:38:13):**  And in that way, you're both learning, continuously learning about your system, but you're also  
**[0:38:19-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:38:19):**  able to check to see if what you thought you knew about your system is actually true.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:38:25):**  And also how could you fine tune?  
**[0:38:27-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:38:27):**  How can you tune up that system and continually going forward, tuning up.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:38:33):**  There's a nice, there's some nice language or useful language in my view for this way  
**[0:38:41-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:38:41):**  of managing that's called circling forward.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:38:45):**  So you circle forward and what that means is that you're continuously revisiting even  
**[0:38:51-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:38:51):**  as you're moving forward.  
**[0:38:53-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:38:53):**  And every time around the circle, you, if you're using this strategy well, you're going  
**[0:39:02-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:39:02):**  to learn something new that's going to make the next circle even more successful.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:39:08):**  So that's just one example of some of the tools we have around that people can put into  
**[0:39:16-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:39:16):**  place that change their behavior, their management.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:39:21):**  Another really important piece for coming years and it's not minor or a little extra  
**[0:39:28-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:39:28):**  is learning to cope with loss, with grief, with stress.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:39:37):**  That's a really important piece of resilient agriculture is working using the tools that  
**[0:39:44-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:39:44):**  we know, and we have a lot of good tools for personal resilience or psychological resilience.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:39:51):**  Let's see if I've well, and then kind of the last big, big piece.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:39:56):**  Oh, really there's, there's kind of two.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:40:00):**  We'll call it, we'll call it one.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:40:03):**  Sorry.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:40:04):**  This is my, I'm a recovering academic.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:40:06):**  So you just got a little bit of, of the academic dithering.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:40:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:40:12):**  Um, the last piece we're going to just call it social, social piece.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:40:17):**  Right.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:40:18):**  And so really important piece of what I've learned, applying resilience thinking to agriculture  
**[0:40:26-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:40:26):**  is just how important the community within which the farm resides is important to the  
**[0:40:36-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:40:36):**  farm's own resilience.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:40:37):**  So I think it's fair.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:40:39):**  It's very fair to argue.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:40:40):**  There's a lot of evidence that a farm on its own cannot be resilient.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:40:46):**  It could be self-reliant.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:40:47):**  It could be a lot of things, but the resilience of a farm resides in the region or the community  
**[0:40:54-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:40:54):**  that it's in.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:40:56):**  And so I think that's actually great because what that says to me is that everyone has  
**[0:41:03-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:41:03):**  a stake, anyone who eats has a stake in making sure the agriculture in their region or supporting  
**[0:41:11-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:41:11):**  the resilience of agriculture in their region.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:41:13):**  So what does that mean practically?  
**[0:41:16-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:41:16):**  It means getting involved in policymaking around agriculture in your region.

**[0:41:29-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:41:29):**  and by creating places to purchase those products.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:41:35):**  It means all the ways that everyone outside of farming helps to shape the space that farmers  
**[0:41:44-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:41:44):**  have to move to adapt, to transform.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:41:49):**  We all have a role there and it's really, it's a really critical role actually because  
**[0:41:55-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:41:55):**  farmers cannot do this alone.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:41:58):**  And the current, at least in the US, the current policy environment actually doesn't give farmers  
**[0:42:06-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:42:06):**  very much room to move.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:42:09):**  They can't be nimble.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:42:11):**  And that's what you need to be in order to be resilient.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:42:14):**  And so we definitely, there's work to be done, important work to be done to create a bigger  
**[0:42:22-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:42:22):**  space for farmers to move, to give them more options and also to support the changes they  
**[0:42:29-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:42:29):**  need to make on their farms.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:42:32):**  So that's a social piece.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:42:33):**  So I've just talked a little bit about practices that enhance natural resource resilience,  
**[0:42:40-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:42:40):**  practices that enhance human resilience and the ability to manage a resilient landscape  
**[0:42:46-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:42:46):**  or resilient farm business and then the social side of all of this, which really is the container  
**[0:42:55-0:42:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:42:55):**  that farms operate within.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/laura-lengnick-on-the-principles-of-building-climate-resilient-farms-part-1/#t=0:42:58):**  So how do we change that bigger space as well?

**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:00:09):**  You're in the right place for all things regenerative living, ecological restoration,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:00:14):**  permaculture and natural building.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:00:16):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:00:18):**  In this show, it's my job to interview leaders, innovators and rebels on the cutting edge  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:00:22):**  of their fields as we look for solutions to our generation's most urgent challenges  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:00:27):**  and share these techniques and information so that you can join us in creating a healthy  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:00:31):**  and abundant world for everyone.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:00:33):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:00:35):**  Alright, so as I mentioned in the introduction in last week's episode, this podcast is  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:00:44):**  going to be going through a transformation next season.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:00:48):**  Starting on February the 6th, this will be called the Regenerative Skills Podcast and  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:00:52):**  will take on a shorter format of actionable information that you can use to participate  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:00:56):**  in the regeneration of the land and the communities around you.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:01:00):**  But even though I'm excited for the changes to come, there's a lot that I'm going to  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:01:03):**  miss about this original show that has taught me so much.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:01:07):**  I've made some truly incredible connections, not only with the guests of the show through  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:01:11):**  interviews, but through the conversations and friendships that have come from listeners  
**[0:01:15-0:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:01:15):**  and fans of the program like you.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:01:17):**  I'm even now working directly with friends who first reach out to me because they love  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:01:21):**  the show and I've learned so much from the suggestions, insights and critiques that you  
**[0:01:26-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:01:26):**  listeners have sent in.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:01:27):**  That's why I want to give you listeners a chance to be featured on the final episode  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:01:31):**  of the Abundant Edge Podcast on the 1st of January this new year.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:01:36):**  All you have to do to be considered is to send in a decent quality audio clip telling  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:01:40):**  me about your favorite memory, favorite episode, or just something that you enjoyed about the  
**[0:01:44-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:01:44):**  show over the last four seasons.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:01:47):**  Tell me where you're from and where you like to listen to the show and maybe a way  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:01:51):**  that you've applied something that you learned from one of the interviews.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:01:55):**  The final episode will be a celebration of all of you listening who've supported me  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:01:59):**  and pushed me to keep improving and growing, and I can't wait to hear from you directly.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:02:04):**  Just send your voice message to info at abundantedge.com to share your experience with the regenerative  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:02:09):**  community.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:02:13):**  Welcome back friends and family to the ongoing series on waterway regeneration.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:02:17):**  We've covered a ton of angles on this topic already, from fixing broken water cycles on  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:02:22):**  the land with keyline planning and earthworks, to marine ecosystem restoration through conservation  
**[0:02:26-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:02:26):**  and even farming.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:02:28):**  And today's episode I got to speak with Bruce Kanya of Floating Island International,  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:02:33):**  which developed their patented BioHaven floating island technology as a solution to algae-ridden  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:02:38):**  and nutrient-impaired waterways since 2005.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:02:42):**  And since then they've launched over 9,000 island systems worldwide as solutions to a  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:02:47):**  variety of problems facing contaminated water.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:02:51):**  In this interview, Bruce breaks down the chemical and biological processes that happen in the  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:02:56):**  water when there's heavy nutrient load, and how it affects the balance of oxygen and the  
**[0:03:01-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:03:01):**  life forms that depend on it.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:03:03):**  He also tells me how the floating islands that he's helped to develop work to cycle  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:03:07):**  nutrients of polluted waterways back into the food web that then fosters the beneficial  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:03:12):**  life forms that are emergent elements of healthy water ecosystems and that mature to help the  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:03:17):**  whole system and surrounding ecology to thrive.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:03:21):**  We also take a look at a case study of Fish Fry Lake in Montana, and how it's gone from  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:03:25):**  a polluted lake with regular algae blooms to become the most productive wild fishery  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:03:29):**  in Montana, where people can even swim and snorkel.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:03:34):**  So be sure to stick around to the end of the interview as Bruce explains just how big the  
**[0:03:38-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:03:38):**  potential for these floating wetland systems is as he's looking to develop inhabited floating  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:03:42):**  islands that help to filter and clean the great plastic garbage patches in the Pacific  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:03:47):**  Ocean, and the possibility of creating floating solar farms that function as new real estate  
**[0:03:53-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:03:53):**  as well.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:03:55):**  Bruce also mentions a couple of opportunities for jobs and internships if this is the type  
**[0:03:59-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:03:59):**  of project that you want to get involved in.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:04:01):**  There's an incredible amount of hope and inspiration in this episode, so get ready to learn and  
**[0:04:06-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:04:06):**  dream as I hand things over now to Bruce.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:04:08):**  Why don't I start with a quick overview of the event, I guess, that inspired me to look  
**[0:04:18-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:04:18):**  into potential ways to fix water.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:04:26):**  In fact, here at Shepherd, our research center is a place that had been a sugar beet farm.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:04:38):**  It's right along the Yellowstone River, and in fact, it's right at the point on the map  
**[0:04:44-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:04:44):**  where the Yellowstone, which has been flowing north out of Yellowstone Park, makes a definitive  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:04:51):**  turn to the east.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:04:53):**  You can see the location from space very readily.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:04:58):**  I purchased the property with a view to develop innovation as it related to the intersection  
**[0:05:11-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:05:11):**  between agriculture and wildlife.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:05:17):**  I've been an inventor and focused on a licensing strategy where I would develop inventions  
**[0:05:24-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:05:24):**  and license them to companies that could commercialize them.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:05:30):**  I had a passion around wildlife in particular, but certainly from my personal experience  
**[0:05:37-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:05:37):**  growing up with relatives who farmed and helping them occasionally on the farm, that intersection  
**[0:05:46-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:05:46):**  became really apparent, it has been apparent to me that agriculture is a massive impact  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:05:54):**  on wildlife, and figuring out how those two could correspond well.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:06:00):**  At the time, most inventors were really focused on the IT revolution.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:06:10):**  As a contrarian by nature, I was going off on a different tangent, but when I originally  
**[0:06:18-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:06:18):**  essentially developing this research center, I built a pond, and the pond was receiving  
**[0:06:26-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:06:26):**  irrigation ditch water, which is the way in which agriculture happens in this part of  
**[0:06:34-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:06:34):**  the world.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:06:35):**  You need to essentially step up from the short grass prairie situation where essentially  
**[0:06:44-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:06:44):**  between anywhere from 6 to 12 inches of moisture per year is typical in this country without  
**[0:06:51-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:06:51):**  irrigation.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:06:52):**  So just one notch up from the desert.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:06:55):**  But this pond received water from the bench ditch here in this region, and I had a black  
**[0:07:04-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:07:04):**  dog that would swim in the pond, and on occasion toward late summer, we noted something really  
**[0:07:11-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:07:11):**  distinct.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:07:12):**  He would come out of the pond and his coat would take on a reddish hue.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:07:16):**  The dog was particularly smelly, you could smell him from 50 feet away, and it was amazing  
**[0:07:22-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:07:22):**  to me.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:07:23):**  I'm thinking to myself, here's the Yellowstone River, we're very near the headwaters of the  
**[0:07:28-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:07:28):**  Yellowstone River, and something in this water that is influencing the dog's hair, and it's  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:07:35):**  incredibly potent.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:07:39):**  The dog would actually take on this red hue and stink, and that motivated me to connect  
**[0:07:46-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:07:46):**  with contacts of mine at Montana State University Center for Biotown Engineering, folks that  
**[0:07:53-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:07:53):**  understand water quality issues.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:07:56):**  They explained that we were experiencing cyanobacteria, and cyanobacteria was essentially the problem  
**[0:08:05-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:08:05):**  that was going on that was causing the dog's hair to take on that reddish hue, but it became  
**[0:08:13-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:08:13):**  a concern of mine of what's really happening with water and agriculture.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:08:22):**  That became a similar focus instead of just the intersection of wildlife and agriculture.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:08:29):**  I determined I'd focus down on water and agriculture, and that became essentially the driver that  
**[0:08:37-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:08:37):**  led me to look at potential ways around nature as model that would allow us to fix water.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:08:45):**  Biomimicry, or nature as model, became the driving theme behind what we do here.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:08:53):**  With these observable issues in the water, how did you start to understand the roots  
**[0:08:59-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:08:59):**  of the problem and start to come to some conclusions about how you could intervene to improve not  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:09:07):**  only the health of the water itself, but the whole system that was causing this problem?  
**[0:09:12-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:09:12):**  The data that has been generated by the Center for Biotown Engineering, one of just a couple  
**[0:09:19-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:09:19):**  premier research centers that focused down on biofilm, which is microbes and their residue,  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:09:29):**  which is one of the two engines of life.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:09:32):**  One engine of life would be the autotrophic plant material that essentially uses solar  
**[0:09:38-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:09:38):**  energy to digest minerals and grow plant material.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:09:44):**  The other engine of life being the heterotrophic form of life, microbes and the residue kind  
**[0:09:50-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:09:50):**  of launch that one.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:09:53):**  They are the organisms, like human beings, that eat organic material and derive our energy  
**[0:09:58-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:09:58):**  from that.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:10:01):**  The two engines of life, the heterotrophic is usually underemphasized when it comes to  
**[0:10:09-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:10:09):**  stewardship of water.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:10:10):**  I've learned that since 2005 when that Red Dog event actually happened.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:10:16):**  But the idea of managing a waterway, for example, around both of those engines of life, that  
**[0:10:25-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:10:25):**  became the driving mission and looking at nature and natural methods to find ways that  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:10:32):**  nature is modeling that is what led us ultimately to naturally occurring peat-based floating  
**[0:10:38-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:10:38):**  islands.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:10:39):**  They occur literally around the planet and here in Montana, we're on the 45th parallel  
**[0:10:46-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:10:46):**  and they're relatively, they're not infrequent.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:10:49):**  They happen occasionally throughout the continent and in fact in the southern hemisphere as  
**[0:10:58-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:10:58):**  well.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:10:59):**  But these peat-based floating islands essentially are a mechanism by which nature is creating  
**[0:11:08-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:11:08):**  real estate.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:11:10):**  And we've studied the phenomenon.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:11:13):**  We're trying to essentially replicate or biomimic this phenomenon.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:11:20):**  And to give you an example, Oliver, we have at one point, we launched an island, we knew  
**[0:11:27-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:11:27):**  what its dry weight was very clearly upon launch.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:11:33):**  And then after 11 weeks of growing season, we brought the island back out again, went  
**[0:11:39-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:11:39):**  back to air dry and tested for biomass buildup and learned that we had grown by 72%.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:11:47):**  That growth took two forms primarily.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:11:50):**  One form was the biofilm and the TSS, the total suspended solids, the particulates in  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:11:57):**  water, the dust in water that bonds to that biofilm.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:12:02):**  That was one of the forms.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:12:03):**  The other form would be plant humus that occurs on top of the island and builds up.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:12:08):**  So the island was getting progressively thicker over time, almost doubling in about two-thirds  
**[0:12:14-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:12:14):**  of one growing season.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:12:17):**  When we study naturally occurring islands, Oliver, like in a place for example called  
**[0:12:22-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:12:22):**  Chippewa flowage in northern Wisconsin where the Chippewa River was dammed at one point,  
**[0:12:30-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:12:30):**  water backs up over peat bogs, peat bogs which incorporate, there's such a fine density of  
**[0:12:37-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:12:37):**  material in the peat itself that the bio gas generated by microbes in the peat is trapped,  
**[0:12:44-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:12:44):**  making that peat somewhat buoyant.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:12:46):**  So when water backs up over the peat bog, a fraction of the peat can rip up and become  
**[0:12:53-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:12:53):**  a floating island, after which plants colonize that and as the island gets progressively  
**[0:13:00-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:13:00):**  thicker, the islands grow.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:13:03):**  One island that we study a lot is actually 30 acres large and supports tens of thousands  
**[0:13:08-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:13:08):**  of mature white cedar trees and other forms of trees too, but the bio complexity associated  
**[0:13:16-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:13:16):**  with the riparian edge around the perimeter of that island is incredible.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:13:20):**  There's so many things we've learned from these islands that stand out.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:13:25):**  Here's another example.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:13:26):**  Let's take a one square meter section around the perimeter of the island and count the  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:13:33):**  species of plants that occur there.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:13:37):**  In one instance we came up with nearly 200, but over and above that the other stark difference  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:13:46):**  in a setting like that as compared to human agriculture for example is that you don't  
**[0:13:51-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:13:51):**  find annuals occurring in that setting, it's almost entirely perennial plant life.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:14:00):**  Annuals are almost considered annuals to be a human invention in terms of how we focus  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:14:06):**  on them with agriculture, but nature is focusing on perennials that invest a lot more in their  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:14:11):**  root systems and are typically more resilient too.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:14:17):**  So the island itself, that 30 acre island within about 90 feet of its perimeter was  
**[0:14:26-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:14:26):**  19 feet thick and essentially moves around the Chippewa flowage.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:14:33):**  But the other point about Chippewa flowage that is reflective of the impact these floating  
**[0:14:40-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:14:40):**  islands can have is the fact that the apex predator fish in North America, arguably,  
**[0:14:48-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:14:48):**  would be the muskellunge.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:14:51):**  It's in the pike family, but bigger than northern pike.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:14:54):**  In fact, the world record came from that flowage at 69 pounds, 15 ounces.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:14:59):**  And when you snorkel or dive around the perimeter of this island, it becomes very apparent why.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:15:05):**  The islands are fish aggregating devices, which is a term that's used around aquaculture.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:15:14):**  And in particular, I've run across that term in reference to brush park aquaculture, which  
**[0:15:20-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:15:20):**  has some parallels with the floating island system that we're studying here.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:15:27):**  But in any case, the matrix of roots around the perimeter of the island were functioning  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:15:36):**  as biofilm reactive surface area.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:15:39):**  And growing biofilm, which is the base material for paraffitin.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:15:47):**  Paraffitin is biofilm and whatever sticks to it.  
**[0:15:52-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:15:52):**  And when biofilm occurs near the surface, there'll be a phytoplankton component of it.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:16:01):**  It could be a green algae or it could be even a blue green, perhaps even some cyanobacteria.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:16:07):**  But as you get lower in the water and light becomes less available, then another form  
**[0:16:18-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:16:18):**  of phytoplankton, diatoms tend to be the dominant form of autotrophic life that combines with  
**[0:16:29-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:16:29):**  the biofilm slash paraffitin.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:16:32):**  And reality here is that diatom based paraffitin is the incredible way to grow fish.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:16:42):**  It cycles into fish very readily.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:16:46):**  So bear in mind, if you have both autotrophic and heterotrophic going on in a waterway,  
**[0:16:51-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:16:51):**  you're cycling nutrients out of that water and up and into the food web at a terrific  
**[0:16:58-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:16:58):**  rate.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:16:59):**  And the productivity that can be associated with that when dealing with nutrient impaired  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:17:04):**  water with water that has simply too many nutrients because of agriculture is startling.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:17:10):**  It's remarkable and very, very exciting to me.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:17:14):**  We're seeing that phenomenon occur now on Fish Fry Lake here in Montana, which I can  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:17:21):**  arguably say is the most productive wild fishery in the state of Montana.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:17:26):**  The catch rate on fish is literally one fish a minute.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:17:30):**  And those fish represent a terrific way to cycle nutrients out of the water and ultimately  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:17:39):**  prevent harmful algae blooms that tend to occur otherwise.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:17:43):**  It seems like a simple way of explaining it or kind of distilling it down is that these  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:17:48):**  nutrients are only becoming an issue because they're out of balance with the rest of the  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:17:53):**  system and because some part of it has been impaired either by removing elements that  
**[0:17:58-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:17:58):**  function like swamps or wetlands that are natural filtration systems that would do this  
**[0:18:05-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:18:05):**  regularly, and putting in some kind of intermediary in order to bring the nutrients back into  
**[0:18:12-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:18:12):**  the food web and convert them into things that are beneficial for the entire system  
**[0:18:17-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:18:17):**  in your case fish, plant matter and whatnot.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:18:20):**  Because I mean essentially they are nutrients and if managed correctly they can be a beneficial  
**[0:18:26-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:18:26):**  I guess accelerator for other forms of life in the system that you're trying to foster.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:18:32):**  But before we talk more about the larger aspect of bringing all of these essential components  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:18:38):**  of an ecosystem into harmonic function, can you tell me a little bit more about the function  
**[0:18:44-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:18:44):**  of biofilm in water filtration and how exactly it does that?  
**[0:18:55-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:18:55):**  Biofilm Oliver is limited by the usual parameters, but the two really big ones are surface area  
**[0:19:02-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:19:02):**  and circulation, temperature, residence time, pH of the water, all those are other factors,  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:19:10):**  but the two big ones are surface area and circulation.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:19:15):**  So those plant roots that occurred around the perimeter of the floating island that  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:19:19):**  we study represent a blend, a wonderful setting in which both occur.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:19:24):**  The surface area is the plant roots themselves and the root hairs on those plant roots, and  
**[0:19:30-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:19:30):**  over and above that the wind and wave action that influences or comes in contact with that  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:19:36):**  surface area represents a form of circulation.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:19:41):**  The phytoplankton component is how oxygen and dissolved oxygen is being communicated  
**[0:19:46-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:19:46):**  back into the water by the way.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:19:49):**  But diatoms, unlike cyanobacteria or blue-green algae, they have a different life model.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:19:57):**  They don't go through that remarkable feast or famine, explosive growth and then die off,  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:20:04):**  and then consumption of dissolved oxygen that the blue-greens and the cyanobacterias go  
**[0:20:10-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:20:10):**  through.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:20:11):**  So diatoms are more of a steady state.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:20:15):**  Then a gentleman, Redfield, at one point traveled around the world and attempted to answer this  
**[0:20:25-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:20:25):**  question, what is the ratio of nutrient that is essentially nature's model?  
**[0:20:33-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:20:33):**  What is the ratio that occurs in living cells all over the ocean?  
**[0:20:37-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:20:37):**  And he came back with these numbers, 106 carbon, 16 nitrogen, 1 phosphorus.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:20:47):**  But when you take those numbers and compare them to the fertilizer mix ratio that soil  
**[0:20:55-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:20:55):**  scientists and agriculture essentially has been employing, you'll see, for example, 30-30-10.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:21:05):**  Equal parts, one part nitrogen, one part phosphorus, and then some potassium.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:21:10):**  And then they leave carbon to the soil.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:21:13):**  You don't necessarily have to add that.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:21:15):**  It's already there.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:21:16):**  It's ubiquitous.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:21:18):**  But agriculture is operating well outside of nature's model.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:21:24):**  And when those fertilizers are applied to land and ultimately a water event happens,  
**[0:21:31-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:21:31):**  that same ratio ends up getting flushed occasionally in the water, water being at the bottom of  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:21:37):**  a watershed, and that's where it collects and accumulates.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:21:41):**  And that particular phenomenon is why today we're experiencing explosive new volumes of  
**[0:21:51-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:21:51):**  harmful algae blooms.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:21:55):**  The numbers relative to the US and harmful algae blooms, where they're occurring and  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:22:03):**  the impact of them.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:22:07):**  There's two particular impacts associated with harmful algae blooms.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:22:12):**  One is that the explosive growth ultimately becomes massive volume of the plant material  
**[0:22:23-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:22:23):**  itself, which when it dies and is biologically broke down, consumes the biological oxygen  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:22:31):**  demand associated with that, pulls huge volumes of dissolved oxygen out of the water, and  
**[0:22:36-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:22:36):**  can actually deaerate and literally make life for air-breathing biota, for dissolved oxygen-breathing  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:22:44):**  biota in the water, impossible.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:22:48):**  They die.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:22:49):**  The other thing that harmful algae blooms occasionally do, not all the time, but when  
**[0:22:55-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:22:55):**  stressed, they occasionally can generate a form of microsystem that is toxic.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:23:02):**  And that can introduce another very critical variable to a waterway, making the water dangerous  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:23:10):**  for livestock or even for people to experience and or pets.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:23:16):**  But that's happening with increasing frequency around the US.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:23:20):**  It's happening, note though, however this is happening in the developed world where  
**[0:23:24-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:23:24):**  fertilizer, where orthophosphate, synthetic phosphorus essentially derived from hydrocarbons.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:23:32):**  When that essentially occurs in a waterway in big volumes, it typically is the, in freshwater,  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:23:40):**  it typically is the critical variable that results in the harmful algae.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:23:46):**  Nitrogen can play a role too.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:23:47):**  Yeah, I've actually seen examples of this all over the world where I used to live in  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:23:52):**  Lake Atitlan in Guatemala.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:23:55):**  There were constantly different initiatives trying to work on cleaning up the lake there,  
**[0:23:59-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:23:59):**  which suffered from algae blooms and cyanobacteria and dirt in different seasons and after different  
**[0:24:05-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:24:05):**  weather events often contributed by the agriculture going on around, but also just untreated sewage  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:24:12):**  from the towns that were expanding super fast around there.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:24:17):**  You're from Wisconsin.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:24:18):**  I lived there for a while and Lake Menominee, where I used to live not too far from the  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:24:23):**  Twin Cities, was in late summer, often had this layer of this pea soup, that blue-green  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:24:29):**  algae that just suffocated that place and made it really unpleasant, changed the odor.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:24:34):**  And yeah, like you said, it's happening in developed countries, which actually to me  
**[0:24:38-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:24:38):**  doesn't surprise me that much because it's where we're consuming so many of these chemicals  
**[0:24:44-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:24:44):**  in our agricultural systems.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:24:46):**  But I've seen it, yeah, in what we might call undeveloped countries, which don't seem to  
**[0:24:51-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:24:51):**  be sort of under the control of as much agribusiness and harmful chemicals, but it is really starting  
**[0:24:59-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:24:59):**  to get into all of our water systems.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:25:03):**  And I'd like to hear from your experience about some of the importance of the circulation  
**[0:25:09-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:25:09):**  and oxygenation for healthy water and how this plays in with the systems, especially  
**[0:25:16-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:25:16):**  the floating stream bed systems that you implement.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:25:20):**  Well, Oliver, we've searched for cost-effective means by which to incorporate that blend that  
**[0:25:31-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:25:31):**  we describe as nature's wetland effect, that blend of the surface area and circulation.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:25:38):**  And from that derived an air-driven floating stream bed effect.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:25:45):**  That continues to evolve.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:25:47):**  Today, there's a nanobubble phenomenon that is being developed that literally could provide  
**[0:25:58-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:25:58):**  another major means by which to further enhance for appropriate dissolved oxygen content or  
**[0:26:10-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:26:10):**  concentration in waterways because these nanobubble systems are unique in that there's something  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:26:21):**  about them that makes the nanobubble neutral buoyant.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:26:26):**  So instead of an air bubble that wants to rise immediately to the surface, these nanobubbles  
**[0:26:32-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:26:32):**  will remain within the water table.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:26:35):**  In fact, some will even penetrate into the venting zone, into the sludge, the mud on  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:26:42):**  the bottom of a waterway and begin the process of aerating that.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:26:47):**  So the idea of enhanced circulation aeration using perhaps air-driven water movement like  
**[0:26:57-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:26:57):**  we do with the floating stream bed or perhaps integrating nanobubbler systems with that  
**[0:27:04-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:27:04):**  and doing so on an off-grid basis, in other words, using solar power to drive that, that's  
**[0:27:11-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:27:11):**  the direction we're taking now.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:27:12):**  We're looking at massive solar biohaven projects that can actually represent an answer to the  
**[0:27:22-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:27:22):**  scalability issue connected with fixing some of the incredibly nutrient impaired waterways  
**[0:27:31-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:27:31):**  around the world.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:27:33):**  Think of Lake Erie or think of Chesapeake Bay or think even of the incredible dead zone  
**[0:27:40-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:27:40):**  that occurs in the Gulf of Mexico.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:27:43):**  I know we've all heard of that one, but there's another 390 plus dead zones occurring in marine  
**[0:27:50-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:27:50):**  conditions always as a result of the nutrients that are cycling into the ocean at collection  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:27:58):**  points at the bottom of watersheds, rivers that cycle nutrients into the ocean and massive  
**[0:28:04-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:28:04):**  algae blooms that occur in conjunction with them.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:28:07):**  And it's not just the blue, green and cyanobacteria we're talking about, it can be red algae.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:28:15):**  And you've probably heard of the toxicity associated with red algae as it occurs in  
**[0:28:21-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:28:21):**  different marine settings.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:28:23):**  It can very much influence the safety of consuming shellfish, for example.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:28:31):**  But the idea here that there's a means by which to intercept those nutrients and cycle  
**[0:28:43-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:28:43):**  them into appropriate, and that's not a fair word, but cycle them into desirable biota,  
**[0:28:51-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:28:51):**  like for example, healthy, colorful, vibrant fish.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:28:57):**  I'm inspired actually by the test pond that we have here at Sheppard.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:29:05):**  It's a small lake, only six and a half acres of surface area, but roughly 54 acre feet  
**[0:29:13-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:29:13):**  of water.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:29:14):**  An acre foot is essentially an acre 12 inches deep.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:29:20):**  So that fish fry lake system, when we started, we initially took a swale that had a seasonal  
**[0:29:32-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:29:32):**  pond, we dug it out, we dammed it, and it became essentially a perennial pond.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:29:40):**  And immediately, within days, essentially developed a complete cover of filamentous  
**[0:29:45-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:29:45):**  algae and cyanobacteria.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:29:48):**  You couldn't see open water.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:29:51):**  Today the lake isn't just free of the harmful algae bloom, but you've got water clarity  
**[0:29:58-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:29:58):**  that can extend as far as 19 feet.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:30:01):**  And beyond that, it's an incredible fishery.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:30:04):**  And the fish are extremely healthy.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:30:06):**  We can essentially propagate, enhance a fishery in that lake by providing additional habitat.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:30:15):**  And today it's got an incredible forage base.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:30:18):**  The fathead minnow, the crawfish, the other forms of forage fish that occur here ultimately  
**[0:30:25-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:30:25):**  move up and into and through the food web.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:30:28):**  And we end up harvesting at the rate of about 26, 25, 27 pounds of fish per acre foot of  
**[0:30:36-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:30:36):**  water per year.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:30:38):**  And we're just keeping up with the inflow phosphorus when we do that.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:30:44):**  We're just keeping up with it.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:30:46):**  We're not really addressing what's called the legacy phosphorus unless we further expand  
**[0:30:51-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:30:51):**  our harvest from that waterway.  
**[0:30:54-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:30:54):**  But in the face of the COVID-19 and what's going on today, we're noting that many, many  
**[0:31:04-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:31:04):**  people are looking at water that they're stewarding and they're thinking about what can they do  
**[0:31:10-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:31:10):**  to help fix that water.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:31:12):**  So we're seeing a wonderful private water initiative unfolding here in the US that will  
**[0:31:19-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:31:19):**  hopefully keep happening as the pandemic transitions.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:31:28):**  So let's use this as a deeper case study, that of Frist Fry Lake.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:31:32):**  And you explained how you made some alterations in the landscape for it to be able to hold  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:31:37):**  water and that immediately upon filling up and getting established, it developed those  
**[0:31:43-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:31:43):**  cyanobacteria and algae problems right from the start because it's gaining most of its  
**[0:31:49-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:31:49):**  water from agricultural runoff in the region, if I understood correctly.  
**[0:31:53-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:31:53):**  Can you tell me about how you went from that stage to the interventions, first of all,  
**[0:32:00-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:32:00):**  how you came up with them, the interventions that you put in that helped you get to this  
**[0:32:04-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:32:04):**  place now with the incredible turnaround of the quality of water and the productivity  
**[0:32:10-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:32:10):**  of the site that you now enjoy?  
**[0:32:12-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:32:12):**  The reality, Oliver, is that I've had a lot of wonderful scientists essentially looking  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:32:21):**  over my shoulder as we've engaged in this experiment.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:32:26):**  People like Dr. Al Cunningham, one of the initial co-founders of the Center for Biopharm  
**[0:32:32-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:32:32):**  Engineering, an engineer named Frank Stewart, who isn't part of the Center for Biopharm  
**[0:32:41-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:32:41):**  Engineering, but is sort of a liaison between them and me.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:32:48):**  He's a civil engineer.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:32:50):**  Dr. Mark Rienzel and Mark graduated from the Center, but Mark is also a biopharm engineer.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:32:58):**  And with these folks helping, we've been able to structure, test, and move forward scientifically  
**[0:33:11-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:33:11):**  around the process of understanding how much surface area and circulation we will need  
**[0:33:18-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:33:18):**  or is needed in Fish Fry Lake to achieve what we do there.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:33:22):**  So the islands themselves and the surface area, every cubic foot of biohaven floating  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:33:27):**  island provides 375 square feet of surface area.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:33:32):**  And when we filter through that, we have that very effective biofilm reactive surface area  
**[0:33:39-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:33:39):**  in which we can cycle nutrients even more aggressively than blue-green algae can into  
**[0:33:46-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:33:46):**  biofilm.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:33:47):**  So again, we're working around that same premise.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:33:52):**  We want both the autotrophic life forms and the heterotrophic life forms, both engines  
**[0:33:59-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:33:59):**  of life, we're employing to handle the nutrient load in Fish Fry Lake.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:34:06):**  But here's the key point, and I really want to emphasize this, Oliver, which is that large  
**[0:34:13-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:34:13):**  waterways like Lake Erie that experience massive algae blooms today, the only way we're going  
**[0:34:21-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:34:21):**  to be able to do to replicate what's happening on a place like Fish Fry Lake, which is so  
**[0:34:27-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:34:27):**  much smaller, is by making the systems that are there to fix the lake commercially viable.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:34:36):**  The idea of using biohaven and its biofilm reactive surface area matrix to essentially  
**[0:34:45-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:34:45):**  float photovoltaic farms, solar energy farms that will generate alternative energy, clean  
**[0:34:56-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:34:56):**  alternative energy, and can be built to scale, are a way to actually begin to attack the  
**[0:35:05-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:35:05):**  fix, the fix-up of these massive waterways, whether it be Lake Erie or Lake Okeechobee  
**[0:35:11-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:35:11):**  or Lake Mead or Las Vegas Wash or the Chesapeake Bay.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:35:17):**  There are so many, in just New York State, for example, in 2018, there were 394 reported  
**[0:35:25-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:35:25):**  harmful algae blooms, and many of them occurring in some very large lakes.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:35:31):**  You can appreciate the scale of the challenge, but in some perspectives, it's a window of  
**[0:35:39-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:35:39):**  opportunity for humanity.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:35:42):**  If we do essentially learn how to cycle those nutrients into desired biota, into appropriate  
**[0:35:51-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:35:51):**  life forms to essentially perennialize those waterways, take them away from the annuals,  
**[0:35:58-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:35:58):**  if you will, the cyanobacteria effect, the resulting heaven on earth, the incredible  
**[0:36:07-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:36:07):**  productivity and health of the waterway, the idea of taking a fish fry lake and using it  
**[0:36:15-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:36:15):**  as an initial model.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:36:18):**  We focused on floating islands, but there have been other ideas that have been employed  
**[0:36:25-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:36:25):**  there.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:36:26):**  For example, we have a crawfish incubator design in which we provide a net bag full  
**[0:36:35-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:36:35):**  of inert matrix that doesn't break down.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:36:38):**  It's made of a recycled plastic that is further armored, so it doesn't break down.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:36:45):**  We suspend that vertically in a waterway.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:36:49):**  It's essentially colonized by crawfish, and they can use it as a ladder to move up or  
**[0:36:53-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:36:53):**  down.  
**[0:36:54-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:36:54):**  If dissolved oxygen becomes problematic at depth, they can move up and do so without  
**[0:37:02-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:37:02):**  essentially being suffocated.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:37:07):**  The nano-bubbler system that we're talking about, we are installing one of them in fish  
**[0:37:12-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:37:12):**  fry lake two.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:37:14):**  On that basis, we can make the lake productive from top to bottom.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:37:19):**  Its deepest point, 28 feet, instead of being anoxic, can now be aerobic.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:37:27):**  There's a key point about this, too, that not many people today are aware of.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:37:33):**  That is that the lakes across North America � not North America, because I don't know,  
**[0:37:40-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:37:40):**  I don't have good data for Canada � but I can say lakes across the United States,  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:37:46):**  over half of them are nutrient impaired.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:37:50):**  When they're nutrient impaired, they develop an anoxic layer of water.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:37:54):**  That means water without breathable oxygen in it.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:37:59):**  That anoxic water generates a different form of greenhouse gas � methane and nitrous  
**[0:38:06-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:38:06):**  oxide � instead of CO2.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:38:09):**  Accordingly, because of that much more potent greenhouse gas, these lakes across the U.S.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:38:17):**  are greenhouse gas factories.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:38:20):**  Unless we fix them, they're going to continue contributing to climate change.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:38:27):**  The pressure is on to actually find ways to make the potential to fix these massive waterways  
**[0:38:39-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:38:39):**  and the small ones, too, and transition them back to health in order to take measures around  
**[0:38:50-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:38:50):**  reduction of these greenhouse gas factories.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:38:52):**  I find that really inspiring.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:38:55):**  I really want to come back to the full potential of the implication of these systems, both  
**[0:39:02-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:39:02):**  for the ecosystem and economically.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:39:05):**  But I still have some things that I'm trying to work out about this case study of fish  
**[0:39:09-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:39:09):**  fry lake.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:39:10):**  Now, you mentioned that right now you're using the inflow of phosphorus and cycling it back  
**[0:39:16-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:39:16):**  into the food web as the primary propellant for the amount of fish that you're able to  
**[0:39:22-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:39:22):**  produce.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:39:23):**  If for some reason the pollution coming from the agricultural runoff was not bringing in  
**[0:39:29-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:39:29):**  the same amount of nutrients from other sources, would you then have to consider putting in  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:39:36):**  either fish feed or other sort of nutrient source in order to maintain the stock rates  
**[0:39:41-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:39:41):**  that you have?  
**[0:39:42-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:39:42):**  Or is it independent of what's coming in?  
**[0:39:45-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:39:45):**  In fact, a scientist from the Niwa out of New Zealand at one point mentioned a large  
**[0:39:55-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:39:55):**  waterway in New Zealand and noted to me that even if all of the inflow phosphorus stopped  
**[0:40:03-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:40:03):**  completely, they had estimated that there would be an overage.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:40:14):**  They wouldn't catch up relative to having a balanced phosphorus ratio happening in the  
**[0:40:20-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:40:20):**  water for at least four decades.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:40:22):**  Oh, wow.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:40:23):**  Okay.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:40:24):**  So the population is so large that you're not even getting to the point where you're  
**[0:40:29-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:40:29):**  diminishing the stored phosphorus in the land or that's gone into the lower layers.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:40:36):**  I do remember you mentioned this, are just kind of breaking even with the amount that's  
**[0:40:39-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:40:39):**  coming in and cycling that through.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:40:42):**  Correct.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:40:43):**  Then the legacy nutrient inventory still ultimately represents a recoverable resource.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:40:50):**  And here's the other point.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:40:52):**  Here we are in Chippewa flowage, which is in the northern woods of northern Wisconsin,  
**[0:40:57-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:40:57):**  minimal agriculture influence.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:41:01):**  And it is super abundant, even based on nature's standard ratio.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:41:08):**  It's a premier fishery.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:41:10):**  It's a place where world record fish like the musky come from.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:41:15):**  So once we learn, once we accept that nature's wetland effect is how you fix water and we  
**[0:41:24-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:41:24):**  start employing that in these nutrient rich waterways that typically happen where humans  
**[0:41:29-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:41:29):**  happen and agriculture takes place, agriculture being responsible for some 80 to 85% of the  
**[0:41:36-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:41:36):**  nutrient inflow, but other forms of pollution like wastewater or stormwater also can influence  
**[0:41:44-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:41:44):**  these waterways and will continue to do so over time.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:41:48):**  But as we gain motivation and ability to employ and leverage nature's wetland effect, we're  
**[0:41:56-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:41:56):**  going to turn these nutrient rich waterways that are today, the harmful algae bloom, susceptible  
**[0:42:02-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:42:02):**  waterways into remarkable places, wonderful places where incredible abundance will occur.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:42:10):**  And we're seeing that here on Fish Fry Lake and it's truly energizing to be around.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:42:19):**  I did a TED Talk a few years ago and I tried to describe the incredible hope and prospect  
**[0:42:30-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:42:30):**  associated with this phenomenon of taking and essentially learning how to collaborate  
**[0:42:37-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:42:37):**  with nature and move into an upward spiral with our water instead of a downward spiral.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:42:46):**  Today for example, Oliver, if you look underneath islands on Fish Fry Lake, you're likely to  
**[0:42:52-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:42:52):**  find freshwater sponge that has colonized the island matrix and it's a filter feeder.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:43:01):**  It's natural, it's native, it guides you by itself.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:43:04):**  It's like nature's on our side and that freshwater sponge is being grazed by red deer sunfish.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:43:13):**  And they can graze on a portion of it that protrudes from the matrix, but the balance  
**[0:43:20-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:43:20):**  of that sponge occurs within the matrix and actually grows around it.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:43:26):**  So it has a security zone too and it's never overly grazed.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:43:31):**  In any case, we're seeing that nature is extremely available or willing.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:43:40):**  We give it the window of opportunity.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:43:43):**  There it is.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:43:45):**  And in the process, the TSS net water, which will contain everything, the nutrients, the  
**[0:43:55-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:43:55):**  carbon, the other forms of contaminant, the dust essentially that essentially represents  
**[0:44:04-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:44:04):**  everything that washed into the waterway, including microplastics by the way.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:44:11):**  The sticky biofilm bonds all of that onto it and it becomes a form of paraffitin to  
**[0:44:17-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:44:17):**  be bio sequestered, to essentially be processed into real estate.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:44:25):**  That's a way of looking at it.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:44:28):**  The islands as they grow and develop and essentially get thicker and ultimately will frequently  
**[0:44:37-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:44:37):**  tie into a shoreline for example and become part of an under, overhanging bank effect,  
**[0:44:46-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:44:46):**  wonderful riparian edge habitat.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:44:49):**  What we're seeing is, could we do that purposely?  
**[0:44:52-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:44:52):**  Could we do that large enough scale to actually go after the gyres of plastic that occur in  
**[0:45:00-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:45:00):**  the oceans?  
**[0:45:04-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:45:04):**  I'm envisioning that happening one day and it really is, it's part of the energization  
**[0:45:11-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:45:11):**  I guess effect that I mentioned earlier.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:45:14):**  No, it's easy to see and it's something that I got from listening to your previous interviews  
**[0:45:18-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:45:18):**  and looking into some of this work and I've been in contact with a number of other companies  
**[0:45:23-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:45:23):**  and individuals who are working on these types of floating wetland systems.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:45:29):**  With that said, can you explain the technology and the components that make up your floating  
**[0:45:35-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:45:35):**  islands and yeah, if this is something that needs to be made in an industrial setting  
**[0:45:42-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:45:42):**  or is this something that people can manufacture for themselves?  
**[0:45:49-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:45:49):**  Today there's about 9,000 bio havens launched around the world.  
**[0:45:54-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:45:54):**  We have half a dozen licensed manufacturers building islands in New Zealand, in the Netherlands,  
**[0:46:03-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:46:03):**  in China and several here in the US.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:46:08):**  But the islands are made of an inert form of plastic, recycled plastic, polyester, that's  
**[0:46:15-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:46:15):**  what drinking water bottles are made of.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:46:18):**  It's fabricated into a non-woven matrix like a filter-like material and then it's armored.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:46:28):**  Our design life on today's bio havens, Oliver, is 60 years.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:46:34):**  What we're really saying when we say that is the islands are indefinite, they're like  
**[0:46:37-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:46:37):**  a seed.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:46:41):**  Their durability, essentially the island will become encased and humus.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:46:47):**  As it gets progressively thicker, the matrix is totally covered and encased within organic  
**[0:46:54-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:46:54):**  material, mostly organic material.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:46:57):**  TSS of course can have a variable, which is what we're pulling from, can have a variable  
**[0:47:03-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:47:03):**  consistency.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:47:07):**  Obviously in many waterways it will range anywhere from 90% organic, like in chip-wafloidge,  
**[0:47:14-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:47:14):**  to perhaps 50% here with our ditch water, where the other fraction might be clay colloidal  
**[0:47:22-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:47:22):**  or something inert like that, the big fractions at least.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:47:26):**  But this polyester, which is one of the very safest forms of polymer, which is why it's  
**[0:47:34-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:47:34):**  used in drinking water bottles, is further armored with a coating of the same kind of  
**[0:47:43-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:47:43):**  liner material that's used to coat the insides of municipal drinking water containers, massive  
**[0:47:53-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:47:53):**  tanks.  
**[0:47:56-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:47:56):**  It's also the same material used to coat the bedding of pickup trucks.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:48:02):**  It's incredibly UV resistant.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:48:08):**  Your question about can people build floating islands at home, I went through somewhere  
**[0:48:13-0:48:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:48:13):**  between 600 and 1,000 prototypes before we got BioHaven to the point where we thought  
**[0:48:21-0:48:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:48:21):**  it was commercial.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:48:23):**  We launched and since then we've continued to improve and develop around it.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:48:30):**  There are folks, in fact we know of some settings where people have developed their own islands  
**[0:48:38-0:48:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:48:38):**  and there's been a lot of creative things happening around that.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:48:43):**  But I want to emphasize that if they do this, if they do want to build their own island  
**[0:48:49-0:48:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:48:49):**  that use nature as model, note that those floating peat bogs that occur in places like  
**[0:48:58-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:48:58):**  Chippewa flowage or floating island lake in Yellowstone Park, but they represent the model.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:49:06):**  If somebody wants to build a floating island they should do some diligence and track down  
**[0:49:10-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:49:10):**  how nature does it.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:49:13):**  One other thing, when we build the islands, we do inject a form of marine foam, we inject  
**[0:49:22-0:49:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:49:22):**  it into the matrix, so it forms a nodule of buoyancy that allows us to design for whatever  
**[0:49:31-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:49:31):**  level of what we call reserve buoyancy we need.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:49:36):**  The reserve buoyancy then allows us to design.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:49:39):**  Do we need to support 900 tons of gravel for a habitat island for the cast in turn for  
**[0:49:45-0:49:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:49:45):**  the Army Corps of Engineers?  
**[0:49:47-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:49:47):**  We've done that.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:49:48):**  Or do we need to support a solar farm?  
**[0:49:52-0:49:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:49:52):**  We will do that.  
**[0:49:53-0:50:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:49:53):**  We're in fact talking right now with an international alternative energy developer from Europe and  
**[0:50:01-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:50:01):**  we're essentially testing and working with them around that very prospect.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:50:06):**  So these are truly exciting times and I hope I've answered your question in terms of the  
**[0:50:13-0:50:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:50:13):**  construction of floating islands and how we do what we do, but I did want to include one  
**[0:50:20-0:50:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:50:20):**  other point.  
**[0:50:22-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:50:22):**  Biofilm is buoyant.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:50:24):**  When you provide sufficient surface area, biofilm, which is ubiquitous underwater, will  
**[0:50:32-0:50:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:50:32):**  occur and when you keep that system aerobic it will generate four and a half times or  
**[0:50:38-0:50:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:50:38):**  more biogas than it does if and when it slips into anoxic status.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:50:44):**  What that means is that surface area and circulation, aeration, should come together in your system.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:50:51):**  So Bruce, I understand that part and it was very well answered, but I'm wondering if these  
**[0:50:56-0:51:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:50:56):**  islands then get to a point either in regular decomposition as the carbon material starts  
**[0:51:02-0:51:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:51:02):**  to break down or even just in an amount of mass as they grow at the bioaccumulation that  
**[0:51:09-0:51:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:51:09):**  you mentioned that they either need to be harvested out or broken down and replenished  
**[0:51:14-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:51:14):**  or some other measure taken so that they don't overgrow the space or even potentially start  
**[0:51:21-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:51:21):**  to sink.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:51:23):**  Is there regular maintenance that needs to be done on these?  
**[0:51:25-0:51:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:51:25):**  You remember that 30 acre island I mentioned on Chippewa Flowage?  
**[0:51:29-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:51:29):**  Yeah, actually I had meant to ask you if that was, is that a man-made structure or is that  
**[0:51:35-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:51:35):**  naturally occurring?  
**[0:51:37-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:51:37):**  Naturally occurring.  
**[0:51:38-0:51:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:51:38):**  And the reservoir was only 88 years old.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:51:42):**  So we projected that that island probably occurred with the initial flooding, that backing  
**[0:51:50-0:51:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:51:50):**  up of water from the, because it's a reservoir, so it's probably at the time 88 years old.  
**[0:51:58-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:51:58):**  And so right now that was some eight or nine years ago, so it's even older now.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:52:03):**  But the point is that 19 feet thick, roughly 30 yards from the edge, shaped like a deep  
**[0:52:12-0:52:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:52:12):**  dish pie.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:52:14):**  Eventually it'll probably tie into shore and lock in and become part of the waterways shoreline.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:52:23):**  How long will that last?  
**[0:52:25-0:52:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:52:25):**  And the other, this vision Oliver of harvesting plastic from the gyres where it accumulates  
**[0:52:34-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:52:34):**  in the Pacific ocean.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:52:38):**  The huge component of the plastic in that setting are microplastics.  
**[0:52:45-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:52:45):**  That's the bulk of it.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:52:48):**  And the idea of incorporating them into the biomass that becomes literally large islands  
**[0:52:55-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:52:55):**  that people live on.  
**[0:52:58-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:52:58):**  I believe that vision will happen.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:53:01):**  And I don't think we're that far away from being able to do.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:53:04):**  Well, let's continue to explore some of the full potential of this technology because  
**[0:53:09-0:53:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:53:09):**  it's not a single technology in and of itself.  
**[0:53:12-0:53:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:53:12):**  You're just mimicking these naturally occurring islands and their own growth rates and maturation  
**[0:53:18-0:53:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:53:18):**  through a little bit of guidance and a little bit of, I guess, modern technology put into  
**[0:53:23-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:53:23):**  it to give it some parameters, it sounds like more than anything.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:53:28):**  And in a few cases, some mechanical assistance, like in the case of the nano bubbles or aeration  
**[0:53:34-0:53:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:53:34):**  pumps.  
**[0:53:35-0:53:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:53:35):**  You mentioned that this has the potential to be a system that functions with fisheries,  
**[0:53:42-0:53:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:53:42):**  much like the lake that you've used as an example, that it has the buoyancy that can  
**[0:53:46-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:53:46):**  hold perhaps settlements, houses, solar farms.  
**[0:53:52-0:53:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:53:52):**  Where do you see this going eventually and where are you trying to direct it with your  
**[0:53:56-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:53:56):**  company?  
**[0:53:58-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:53:58):**  You know, the idea of being able to grow new real estate has incredible implications.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:54:09):**  I recently looked at a map of Florida and what happens in Florida as sea level rises.  
**[0:54:20-0:54:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:54:20):**  The vision, Oliver, of providing a means by which humans can still live and function in  
**[0:54:32-0:54:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:54:32):**  those settings, I think that's in our future.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:54:40):**  I guess my hope is that, I don't, well let me say it this way, I believe that here in  
**[0:54:49-0:54:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:54:49):**  the United States, the current administration is not being responsive around climate change.  
**[0:54:57-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:54:57):**  And that very much has to change.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:55:01):**  I think the idea of the world stage collaborating around the response to climate change is fundamental,  
**[0:55:12-0:55:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:55:12):**  has to happen.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:55:15):**  So in answer to your question about the future, I am optimistic and hopeful and optimistic  
**[0:55:23-0:55:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:55:23):**  that humans will become responsive and that will take on this challenge internationally  
**[0:55:32-0:55:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:55:32):**  and ultimately test the premise and prove it out, that we can grow new real estate and  
**[0:55:40-0:55:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:55:40):**  live on it.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:55:43):**  But in the process of doing that, we're also going to clean up our waterways.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:55:46):**  We're also going to produce the abundant alternative energy that makes such systems scalable, helps  
**[0:55:55-0:55:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:55:55):**  pay for them.  
**[0:55:56-0:55:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:55:56):**  Yeah, it's an important component.  
**[0:55:59-0:56:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:55:59):**  Yeah, we call it going commercial.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:56:02):**  We have to be commercial with our solutions.  
**[0:56:06-0:56:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:56:06):**  Solutions by themselves are simply too expensive.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:56:09):**  Yeah, well said Bruce.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:56:10):**  And on that note, I know that you have some opportunities for both jobs and internships.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:56:17):**  For the people listening to this who feel inspired by your vision and the work that  
**[0:56:21-0:56:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:56:21):**  you've pioneered in this area, how can they get in touch with you and perhaps investigate  
**[0:56:27-0:56:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:56:27):**  further how they can join and help to accelerate this type of work?  
**[0:56:32-0:56:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:56:32):**  Our website, floatingislandinternational.com, info at the Floating Island International,  
**[0:56:41-0:56:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:56:41):**  we'll get them in touch with our folks.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:56:43):**  And I can say too that interns are a huge part of the energy that happens here.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:56:50):**  We've had some incredibly wonderful individuals come through here and spend the season with  
**[0:56:57-0:57:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:56:57):**  us and then go on to function within the network.  
**[0:57:03-0:57:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:57:03):**  And today we truly are an international network.  
**[0:57:07-0:57:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:57:07):**  So the window of opportunity around working in this field is a very large one.  
**[0:57:14-0:57:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:57:14):**  It does really seem to be growing and picking up pace, which is great because certainly  
**[0:57:18-0:57:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:57:18):**  this type of work is in very dire need at the moment.  
**[0:57:22-0:57:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:57:22):**  And your website has a lot of really great resources on there, a number of which I will  
**[0:57:27-0:57:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:57:27):**  link to on the show notes for this episode, including the TED Talk that you did, which  
**[0:57:31-0:57:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:57:31):**  you mentioned.  
**[0:57:33-0:57:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:57:33):**  You have a great article that really taught me a few things, the do's and don'ts of waterway  
**[0:57:38-0:57:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:57:38):**  stewardship and the link for those internship opportunities is there as well that I'll be  
**[0:57:44-0:57:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:57:44):**  sure to link to.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:57:45):**  Great.  
**[0:57:46-0:57:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:57:46):**  Well, Oliver, thank you very much for the work you're doing too.  
**[0:57:50-0:58:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:57:50):**  Yeah, I'm so grateful to you and to people like you that have leveraged the current wonderful  
**[0:58:02-0:58:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:58:02):**  abilities to communicate across the planet.  
**[0:58:07-0:58:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:58:07):**  So thank you for what you do too.  
**[0:58:10-0:58:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:58:10):**  And I very much appreciate your invitation to present here today.  
**[0:58:15-0:58:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:58:15):**  It has been absolutely my pleasure.  
**[0:58:16-0:58:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:58:16):**  I appreciate your support and I really look forward to staying in contact.  
**[0:58:19-0:58:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:58:19):**  It seems like you're on a very positive trajectory that is accelerating, especially with the  
**[0:58:25-0:58:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:58:25):**  gain of support and the urgency that's come out of the coronavirus crisis and people being  
**[0:58:30-0:58:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:58:30):**  much more aware in just a short time of how closely linked environmental problems and  
**[0:58:37-0:58:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:58:37):**  catastrophes in our ecosystems come to affect us and realizing that it's not separate, that  
**[0:58:46-0:58:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:58:46):**  our actions are directly linked to the health and the comfort of our own lives.  
**[0:58:51-0:58:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:58:51):**  And so thank you so much for your work.  
**[0:58:53-0:58:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:58:53):**  I look forward to being in touch again in the future and you have a great rest of your  
**[0:58:56-0:58:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:58:56):**  day.  
**[0:58:57-0:58:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:58:57):**  You too.  
**[0:58:58-0:59:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:58:58):**  Thank you, Oliver.  
**[0:59:00-0:59:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:59:00):**  All right, that wraps things up for this week's episode.

**[0:59:14-0:59:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:59:14):**  The best part is that you can search by category, topics or keywords on our brand new website  
**[0:59:18-0:59:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:59:18):**  rather than scrolling through more than 140 interviews.  
**[0:59:22-0:59:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:59:22):**  I've spoken to experts on everything from growing your own food, building homes from  
**[0:59:26-0:59:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:59:26):**  natural materials, beekeeping, Burma compost, permaculture design techniques, and so much  
**[0:59:31-0:59:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:59:31):**  more.  
**[0:59:32-0:59:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/bruce-kania/#t=0:59:32):**  Before we go, I just want to say thank you so much to those of you who have taken the

**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:05:54):**  And to get us started, let's do some little introductions for people who haven't heard  
**[0:05:58-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:05:58):**  about us like Nick, this is your first time on the show.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:06:01):**  But Jacob, this is your second episode.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:06:03):**  And so if anybody wants to learn more in depth about what you've done in the past and your  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:06:06):**  focus on centropic agroforestry, I'll put the link to that episode in the show notes  
**[0:06:11-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:06:11):**  for this so they can check you out.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:06:13):**  But why don't you give us a little update?  
**[0:06:14-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:06:14):**  Because you're going through some transitions in your life right now.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:06:17):**  Tell us a little bit about your background and what's going on.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:06:20):**  So yeah, I've been going through quite a bit of transition and it's still on the way.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:06:24):**  So I was from June 2016 to the end of 2020, the farm manager out of the yoga retreat center  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:06:31):**  in Andalusia in Southern Spain.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:06:35):**  I left that I had sort of a year out being a father while I was looking for new projects  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:06:40):**  in Western Spain, decided that that area wasn't for us either.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:06:44):**  I was doing a bit of intermediary work in a market garden the last year and decided  
**[0:06:50-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:06:50):**  actually the best option for us.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:06:51):**  My wife is from Patagonia, Argentina from a very interesting town where there's a lot  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:06:57):**  of permaculture and natural building interesting projects going on.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:07:00):**  So we actually decided to take the plunge and move to a little town in Northern Patagonia  
**[0:07:06-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:07:06):**  called El Balsón where we have already family, friends and a lot of social capital waiting  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:07:12):**  for us after about six, seven years in Spain now.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:07:16):**  So yeah, transcontinental move is coming up to a new climate and new possibilities.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:07:24):**  Super exciting, man.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:07:26):**  We're going to dig into that in a minute.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:07:28):**  Let's go to Nick Steiner, my man, who I work with very closely at Climate Farmers.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:07:32):**  We work on the academy and building services for farmers switching to regenerative transitions  
**[0:07:37-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:07:37):**  here in Europe together.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:07:38):**  Nick, why don't you give us a little of your personal background as well as the project  
**[0:07:43-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:07:43):**  that you're working on right now?  
**[0:07:44-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:07:44):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:07:45):**  Yeah, such a pleasure to be here after listening for so many years.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:07:49):**  Yeah, I started out kind of in the countryside.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:07:53):**  So just on the border of Hamburg, Northern Germany, always been out in the fields as  
**[0:07:58-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:07:58):**  a child.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:07:59):**  And yeah, kind of through documentaries, I realized, okay, this whole climate thing seems  
**[0:08:04-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:08:04):**  to be something relevant.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:08:05):**  Maybe we should do something about it.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:08:08):**  And I realized quite quickly that it helps to get together with a lot of good people  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:08:11):**  if you want to get stuff done and just sitting around the campfire and complaining doesn't  
**[0:08:15-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:08:15):**  really change anything.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:08:17):**  So that's why I decided to study business and actually use that as a tool for change.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:08:24):**  And yeah, while studying, somehow I stumbled upon a book by Zep Holzer about permaculture.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:08:33):**  It was actually, it was on Philip's toilet, Philip our coworker.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:08:36):**  There I found my first book about permaculture and read it and was like, wow, this stuff  
**[0:08:40-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:08:40):**  makes so much sense.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:08:42):**  And so after university, because I studied in the Netherlands and Amsterdam, I wanted  
**[0:08:47-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:08:47):**  it a bit warmer.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:08:49):**  And yeah, I moved to Tenerife, so on the Canary Islands.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:08:52):**  And yeah, it's beautiful.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:08:53):**  It's warm, everything.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:08:54):**  But there on the farm where I work, I had some woofing to get some practical experience  
**[0:08:59-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:08:59):**  also with this whole permaculture thing and realized, wow, we have 10 days of rain a year,  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:09:05):**  extremely brittle, 280 millimeters.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:09:08):**  So like hardly anything.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:09:10):**  I think for the listeners in the US, I think it's around 11 inches, if my conversion is  
**[0:09:14-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:09:14):**  correct.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:09:15):**  Yeah, so there I realized, wow, water is such an important thing.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:09:20):**  And I got super into the whole thing of growing food forests, of how to build soil, how to  
**[0:09:26-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:09:26):**  do water management, all these kind of aspects.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:09:29):**  And then I wanted to plant a food forest.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:09:31):**  So I did that then at another farm where I was volunteering.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:09:36):**  And in that time, I also did a lot of volunteer management because I was there for quite some  
**[0:09:40-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:09:40):**  time and new people came in.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:09:41):**  And I think we did a calculation at some point, it was over 120 volunteers in that time that  
**[0:09:46-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:09:46):**  I was involved with.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:09:48):**  And during that, I realized like, oh, I really like telling people about regeneration and  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:09:53):**  kind of instructing them on how to do it and what to do.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:09:57):**  And out of that evolved some kind of workshops and yeah, and more and more into that direction.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:10:03):**  And since I was always in contact with our good friend, Philip, because we worked on  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:10:08):**  a different project and then one day he told me about this new company idea that he had  
**[0:10:13-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:10:13):**  called Climate Farmers, where he wanted to revolutionize kind of agriculture in Europe  
**[0:10:19-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:10:19):**  together with a friend.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:10:20):**  And that sounded really interesting.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:10:21):**  I realized like, hey, education might be important for that.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:10:25):**  And so I joined Climate Farmers at the very beginning.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:10:30):**  And yeah, then when COVID hit, I went back to Germany for a little while, did a lot of  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:10:35):**  home office there, permaculture, but yeah, I really missed the sun and missed everything.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:10:40):**  So now in March, I moved back to Tenerife, finally got my own little property off grid,  
**[0:10:47-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:10:47):**  very degraded.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:10:48):**  But yeah, I'm back here and now I'm fully experiencing what it's like to live an off  
**[0:10:53-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:10:53):**  grid life in a very dry environment.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:10:55):**  For sure, man.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:10:57):**  It's been really cool to watch you in this transition process as you moved out there  
**[0:11:01-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:11:01):**  very recently.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:11:02):**  You've only been there a handful of months now.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:11:04):**  And I know you have experience on the island, but you're also in somewhat of a bit of a  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:11:08):**  microclimate within the island and a very, very small watershed.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:11:12):**  And we've been working together to look at the options that you have, as well as on the  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:11:15):**  course that we're both taking together on hydrological restoration.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:11:20):**  So we'll get into that again in a minute.

**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:11:25):**  And that's to explore some of the knowledge and the experience that we've all gained in  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:11:30):**  making this transition to live out in rural places.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:11:33):**  In your case, Nick, off grid.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:11:35):**  I've been off grid in the farm that I had in Guatemala for a little while.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:11:40):**  Jacob, you've moved around a number of times as well.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:11:43):**  I guess where should we start?  
**[0:11:45-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:11:45):**  I mean, there's so many different angles and perspectives that we could look at this from  
**[0:11:48-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:11:48):**  and everybody's journey is different.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:11:51):**  What have been some of the biggest maybe reality checks or wake up calls that you learned when  
**[0:11:57-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:11:57):**  you did it the first time or that you didn't expect?  
**[0:12:00-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:12:00):**  Jacob?  
**[0:12:01-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:12:01):**  Well, definitely the people aspect of it.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:12:04):**  If you're going to be living off the grid and really starting one of these projects  
**[0:12:09-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:12:09):**  from the ground up, the people aspect is highly, highly important because we all have expectations.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:12:16):**  And a lot of the times other people have different ideas and different expectations.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:12:20):**  And when these don't match, you can quite often be rowing in different directions.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:12:25):**  And that can cause a lot of, how do you say, stalls of development and maybe even goes  
**[0:12:33-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:12:33):**  backwards.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:12:34):**  So it's very important to have your human element of it very well organized.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:12:37):**  It's easy to come into this with a lot of idealism when it's taken me many years for  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:12:43):**  reality and idealism to sort of become more parejo, more equal.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:12:49):**  I guess, Oliver, you could say some similar things about that.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:12:54):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:12:55):**  I mean, let's face it, it's the reason why I'm in Spain and not Guatemala still is those  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:12:59):**  breakdowns of communication and difficulties of coming to agreements with the original  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:13:03):**  people that you might have started an endeavor with, whether those are like romantic partners  
**[0:13:07-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:13:07):**  or their family members.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:13:08):**  In my case, it was close friends.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:13:11):**  And I still consider them friends.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:13:13):**  But our agreement on what we went into the project with about the vision of what we had,  
**[0:13:18-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:13:18):**  a lot of it wasn't put on paper.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:13:19):**  A lot of it wasn't formalized in agreements.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:13:22):**  And when that starts to break down, friendships are tested and expectations lead to disappointment  
**[0:13:31-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:13:31):**  and conflict and such.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:13:33):**  And that's really hard to navigate, especially if you don't have much experience with it.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:13:37):**  That's definitely one of the things that I was challenged by in that project in particular.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:13:41):**  But I've also seen it play out tons of times in client projects, because regardless of  
**[0:13:48-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:13:48):**  where you're coming from, whether you co-own a piece of land that's been in your family  
**[0:13:51-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:13:51):**  for a while and you're close with those people, oftentimes people's long term goals or expectations  
**[0:13:57-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:13:57):**  for the place are not formalized.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:13:59):**  You think, well, I talk with these people all the time or we've been doing this for  
**[0:14:02-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:14:02):**  a long time.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:14:03):**  We're definitely on the same page.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:14:04):**  We understand each other.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:14:05):**  And that's rarely the case.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:14:07):**  I think it's even less common for people who know each other well and have an inherent  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:14:13):**  trust based on existing relationships than people who come into it, let's say, from a  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:14:18):**  business perspective or something that is much less personal.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:14:23):**  Those goals and those expectations tend to be communicated better because it's not assumed  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:14:27):**  that they know what each other's thinking or what they're trying to get out of a project.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:14:31):**  So that kind of communication is something that I've learned a lot about, both from experience  
**[0:14:35-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:14:35):**  and then, of course, needing to research it and get caught up after having it fall apart  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:14:40):**  with what I did.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:14:42):**  And then I guess the second one would be the concept of what people think resilience is  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:14:49):**  in rural life is often a very romanticized concept that comes from social media and Instagram  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:14:55):**  and what people talk about from an urban perspective.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:15:00):**  But very quickly, you're going to get forced to think longer term than you're used to because  
**[0:15:04-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:15:04):**  conveniences are not around.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:15:06):**  You can't just pop down to the store and get something new.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:15:09):**  Or if you do, it's costly, either in time or money or both.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:15:13):**  And you have to start making decisions of like, OK, what am I going to need for the  
**[0:15:16-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:15:16):**  next couple of weeks or to finish this project or to accomplish something that I can't just  
**[0:15:22-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:15:22):**  run back and forth and get all the time?  
**[0:15:25-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:15:25):**  And that was really valuable for me to learn.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:15:27):**  And even though I'm currently living in an apartment with conveniences very nearby, that  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:15:32):**  experience served me really well when the pandemic came up.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:15:37):**  My partner and I were able to prepare even before people started to rush the stores and  
**[0:15:41-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:15:41):**  everything fell off the shelves.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:15:44):**  And we didn't even have to leave our house to go to get toilet paper or to get groceries  
**[0:15:49-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:15:49):**  for over three months.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:15:51):**  And I don't know anybody else who was other than like preppers, but that's another thing.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:15:57):**  And yeah, those are direct experiences I got from just living far away from a lot of stuff  
**[0:16:01-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:16:01):**  where you can't make those quick decisions or impulse buys.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:16:04):**  You have to think about it a lot more far in advance.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:16:07):**  What about you, Nick?  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:16:08):**  Like you said, you grew up kind of living in the country and you've gone back and forth  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:16:12):**  from cities and now to an island, which I think that's a whole context in and of itself.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:16:17):**  What have been some of the things that have really been big learnings for you in the transition?  
**[0:16:22-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:16:22):**  Yeah, I would say the big learnings, there are three main ones.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:16:28):**  So kind of the first one I experienced when I first moved here to the first farm, which  
**[0:16:33-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:16:33):**  was off grid, so complete solar power.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:16:38):**  And there the issue was just sometimes because it was in a region of the island where we  
**[0:16:43-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:16:43):**  get quite a bit of cloud cover.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:16:46):**  And sometimes when the sun doesn't shine for two weeks, the batteries run out.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:16:50):**  And yeah, then, well, you're out of power, which is a bit of a pity.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:16:56):**  The things that ran out the first was, OK, washing machine needed quite a bit of power,  
**[0:17:00-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:17:00):**  the one we had.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:17:01):**  So we could only use it when the sun was really shining.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:17:03):**  But I don't really mind when you live on a farm, you don't really care about clean clothing  
**[0:17:06-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:17:06):**  too much.

**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:17:11):**  do you open the fridge door because you don't want all the coal to escape.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:17:16):**  And yeah, those things, I became more conscious.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:17:19):**  Do I really need this electrical appliance or do I really need to use this now or can  
**[0:17:23-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:17:23):**  it wait?  
**[0:17:24-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:17:24):**  So I think that was the first one, electricity.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:17:26):**  You become much more aware of how much you're using and what you really need.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:17:33):**  The second thing I learned there was planning when you need to buy things because for us,  
**[0:17:38-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:17:38):**  it was quite a trip to the hardware store when we needed to buy any supplies.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:17:44):**  And yeah, before, you know, you're used to living in a city or something when you forget  
**[0:17:47-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:17:47):**  something.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:17:48):**  Well, it sucks, but it's maybe half an hour and you can get it.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:17:52):**  But there it was sometimes like one and a half hour drive one way through the hardware  
**[0:17:56-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:17:56):**  store.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:17:57):**  So you really don't want to forget things.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:18:00):**  Then the same happened at a project in Portugal where we're living with a few friends.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:18:05):**  There, the closest supermarket is 45 minutes away.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:18:08):**  So also there you really plan your shopping well.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:18:11):**  So you really want to make sure you don't forget any essentials.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:18:15):**  And you learn to cook and live with less things.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:18:18):**  So you need to become really good at improvisation.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:18:22):**  And you're also responsible for everything.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:18:24):**  You know, if a water line breaks, you're the plumber.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:18:27):**  If something goes wrong with the electricity, you're the electrician.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:18:30):**  So due to YouTube, I learned a lot of things because either you do it or it doesn't happen.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:18:35):**  So those were very big learnings.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:18:37):**  And now at the new place here on Tenerife, my biggest concern at the moment is water  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:18:42):**  because the property has a big water tank, but it's limited.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:18:47):**  So it's only fed by rain.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:18:49):**  And since April, we didn't really get any significant rain.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:18:53):**  And I think the tank has around 20,000 litres.  
**[0:18:56-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:18:56):**  Not sure what that is in gallons.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:18:58):**  But yeah, it's not that much.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:19:00):**  And you really see it go down every day.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:19:03):**  And all the roofs are not yet connected to the tank.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:19:05):**  So I still have to add rain gathers and all these kind of things to make the place more  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:19:08):**  water resilient and to build that up.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:19:12):**  But it's a real concern.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:19:13):**  So when you have a limited amount of water and when it's gone, it's gone, gone.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:19:18):**  There's no other way to get water.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:19:20):**  And so I'm really careful about what I'm planting, how I'm planting.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:19:23):**  I know I connected everything to greywater.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:19:25):**  I'm trying to use every drop as many times as possible.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:19:30):**  And that's a reality check that's really crucial because water is not just for fun and plants,  
**[0:19:35-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:19:35):**  but it's also the water we drink.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:19:38):**  And I think that's something people forget.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:19:39):**  Off-grid life can be amazing, but you really have to learn to limit your consumption and  
**[0:19:45-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:19:45):**  yeah, also your quality of life in some senses.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:19:48):**  Yeah, that's what I remember too from a few times living off-grid.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:19:53):**  One was in the desert outside of Taos, New Mexico that similarly just had a cistern.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:19:59):**  And you start to understand the real value of the resources and the energy that come  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:20:05):**  into a space and how, I guess by default, we're used to using them without even thinking  
**[0:20:11-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:20:11):**  about the quantity, right?  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:20:14):**  Maybe you think about the quantity of energy because it raises on your bill or, you know,  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:20:18):**  for some people it makes a difference on their water bill as well, but it's usually not significant  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:20:22):**  enough that you get into rationing in normal times.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:20:25):**  But let's face it.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:20:26):**  I mean, we're the three of us coming off of what has been a very significant drought here  
**[0:20:31-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:20:31):**  in Western Europe.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:20:33):**  And we're looking at the possibility of, and some of us are already experiencing water  
**[0:20:38-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:20:38):**  rationing and other resource rationing.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:20:40):**  And one of the overall effects of that too, is that the capacity of hydroelectric dams  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:20:46):**  currently is like half of its capacity, which is definitely going to show up on people's  
**[0:20:51-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:20:51):**  electricity bill pretty soon.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:20:53):**  And we just can't take our resources for granted the way we used to.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:20:57):**  I like that Nick, that you mentioned both electricity and water as your concerns when  
**[0:21:01-0:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:21:01):**  you're in an off-grid situation.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:21:04):**  I've talked to a lot of other people who've set up off-grid communities and such, and  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:21:08):**  they've all said the same thing, like electricity is nice to have, but get your water system  
**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:21:13):**  dialed in first, because you can do without cell phone service, you can do without a refrigerator,  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:21:17):**  but what are you going to drink when your water runs out?  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:21:21):**  So put your energies into the essentials and then start working on the extras.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:21:26):**  And also try and make sure that your water supply is not dependent on your electricity  
**[0:21:31-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:21:31):**  supply, because it's often much more fragile.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:21:33):**  What about you, Jacob?  
**[0:21:34-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:21:34):**  Have you had to make these types of real survival type considerations in the different places  
**[0:21:40-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:21:40):**  you've lived?  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:21:43):**  Mostly before previously when I'd be traveling and we'd have to cross a river to get to the  
**[0:21:48-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:21:48):**  place where we're living on the farm, this chocolate farm in Brazil, and we were cooking  
**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:21:52):**  on firewood and it was a canoe ride across the river, yeah, without electricity.  
**[0:21:58-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:21:58):**  And it was a great month.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:21:59):**  I can not romanticize about it as it was more in my earlier days.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:22:04):**  And I mean, in Rancho Mastotel in Costa Rica, we would cook the breakfast on the biogas,  
**[0:22:09-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:22:09):**  but we knew that that's all the biogas would give for us.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:22:12):**  Then the rest of the day, we would have to switch to propane.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:22:15):**  So we got a kind of homeostasis and it never really ran out.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:22:20):**  As long as someone was putting the cow manure in the digester, which we were very conscious  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:22:24):**  of every day, we had to put that manure in and make a slurry and empty the end.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:22:30):**  But it does get you in touch and you start to really think about your energy coming in  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:22:35):**  and your management.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:22:39):**  But where I was actually on the previous project, farm manager, they would actually buy water

**[0:22:51-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:22:51):**  project, they could actually bring water in from down the road where there was a big aquifer.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:22:58):**  But it's not a long term solution, which was quite frustrating to see all the toilets being

**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:24:38):**  where they're dwarf varieties of trees planted in windrows.

**[0:25:38-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:25:38):**  But I also see the huge potential like on the degraded roadsides of these fields you  
**[0:25:41-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:25:41):**  see the wildflowers in the spring getting up to one and a half, two meters tall.

**[0:25:57-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:25:57):**  to bring the biomass back.

**[0:26:11-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:26:11):**  scale that I'm very excited to be going somewhere with a bit cooler weather and a bit more moisture  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:26:17):**  that it's just going to feel really easy.

**[0:26:27-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:26:27):**  Okay, you're coming from northern Europe and you're just used to moisture and cooler weather.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:26:32):**  But this is how it is down here and it's good to have the extremes so you can choose somewhere  
**[0:26:39-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:26:39):**  in the middle.

**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:26:45):**  and you've worked especially with agroforestry systems and you're in the process of planting  
**[0:26:50-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:26:50):**  a food forest.

**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:26:56):**  Everybody wants a food forest, there's books written about it.

**[0:27:17-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:27:17):**  you start putting those plants in.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:27:20):**  Can you talk a little bit more about the I guess the prep and the planning given the  
**[0:27:27-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:27:27):**  little bit of water that you have access to that you're going through to make sure that

**[0:27:34-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:27:34):**  alive?  
**[0:27:35-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:27:35):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:27:36):**  Yeah, I think for me there the biggest learning was also the first farm or more or less homestead  
**[0:27:45-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:27:45):**  where I volunteered because there the owners had an amazing eye for kind of beauty so to  
**[0:27:53-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:27:53):**  say.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:27:54):**  It was super beautiful and there was a strong will to just have a ton of variety, lots of  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:28:00):**  beautiful.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:28:01):**  So they planted insane amounts of plants but mostly kind of plants that also use a lot  
**[0:28:08-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:28:08):**  of nutrients and use a lot of water.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:28:10):**  So not really many support plants and those kind of things.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:28:14):**  So it got a lot more from the time when I was there and kind of telling about the importance  
**[0:28:19-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:28:19):**  of mulching and support plants and all this.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:28:22):**  But still there are so many things planted and I've just visited them and yeah they're  
**[0:28:28-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:28:28):**  also off grid and now they have to use, they told me every two weeks they need to buy 15,000  
**[0:28:34-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:28:34):**  litres of water to keep their plants alive which is huge and it has to come via truck.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:28:43):**  So it's quite expensive.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:28:44):**  And so that really kind of taught me how to be careful with what you put in the ground  
**[0:28:50-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:28:50):**  because once it's planted you need to take care of it.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:28:53):**  And so what I'm doing a lot is I'm now starting lots of local seeds.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:28:57):**  So whenever I leave the house I have a bag with me to collect seeds of what kind of local  
**[0:29:02-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:29:02):**  nitrogen fixing varieties that I see around, they're adapted and I'm collecting just everything  
**[0:29:08-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:29:08):**  I can.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:29:09):**  And I'm growing these at the moment in kind of air prune beds that I build in a system  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:29:14):**  with sub irrigation so really to use as little water as possible and also not to have too  
**[0:29:20-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:29:20):**  much evaporation.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:29:21):**  So I'm just growing these now because I want to start with the ones that can survive.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:29:26):**  And I'm running experiments with I think I have like six trees of different varieties,  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:29:33):**  also fruiting varieties that I put into the ground just to test in different places.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:29:37):**  So I have one kind of hotspot of growth I would say that's the grey water of our shower

**[0:29:47-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:29:47):**  So I'm using that to grow a lot of plants there and to see how they grow.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:29:50):**  Then I have one for the grey water from the kitchen.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:29:52):**  There I'm also growing a lot of seeds so I just put a mulch basin that all the water  
**[0:29:56-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:29:56):**  runs in.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:29:57):**  I just put lots of seeds in to just get them started because it's basically the water will  
**[0:30:02-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:30:02):**  be there anyway so there I'm growing a lot.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:30:05):**  But yeah for me the biggest focus is just support plants so I really I have hardly anything  
**[0:30:09-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:30:09):**  that requires water.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:30:11):**  Just a few avocados because I have the seeds so I just put them in soil and they're coming  
**[0:30:15-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:30:15):**  up.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:30:16):**  Yeah but that for me is the biggest learning and that's also the strategy that I'm running  
**[0:30:20-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:30:20):**  here.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:30:21):**  So really support plants first, get that biomass going, get the shade going.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:30:27):**  So I will start with that.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:30:29):**  Also very resistant plants so that I can slowly start regeneration.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:30:34):**  I can slowly prepare the soil.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:30:36):**  I can slowly cool it down.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:30:38):**  And then over time I will introduce more of the plants that will then also produce food.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:30:45):**  One plant I'm really excited about is the ice cream bean.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:30:49):**  So Inga, I don't know the Latin name at the moment, maybe one of you remembers, but yeah  
**[0:30:53-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:30:53):**  that one is also close to the shower producing like crazy and that one for me it's going  
**[0:30:57-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:30:57):**  to be a nitrogen fixer.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:30:58):**  It produces a lot of biomass, will produce a lot of shade and I'm also excited to eat  
**[0:31:02-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:31:02):**  it.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:31:03):**  So yeah I'm trying to see are there some nitrogen fixing support plants that I can also eat.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:31:08):**  So yeah really stacking those functions.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:31:11):**  And yeah for me I would say to put it really short, I don't plant anything where I'm not  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:31:16):**  sure I can care for it and make sure it gets enough water to survive.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:31:21):**  And rather slow, yeah then over the top planting everything and suddenly I run into problems  
**[0:31:27-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:31:27):**  of keeping things alive.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:31:28):**  Yeah and the way that you're doing it too, it's so low risk.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:31:33):**  I mean you're going around getting free seeds from things that you already know grow in  
**[0:31:36-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:31:36):**  your area and you're trying them out really low budget, very simple, minimal maintenance,  
**[0:31:43-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:31:43):**  very similar to like Mark Shepherd's stun method right.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:31:46):**  If they die, cool that's something that I learned and they shouldn't have been there  
**[0:31:49-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:31:49):**  anyway right.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:31:51):**  And I like the way that Jacob you've articulated this in the past like when we taught that  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:31:55):**  Centropic Agroforestry course with the Green Rebel Farm in Tarragona, how you're talking  
**[0:32:00-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:32:00):**  about being in an accumulation phase at the beginning.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:32:04):**  Everybody wants to go in there and plant their delicate hybrid peach trees in the middle  
**[0:32:08-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:32:08):**  of a desert and that's a food forest.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:32:11):**  But there's a reason why there's such low success rates when you start that way.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:32:16):**  You need to accumulate not only the nutrition but also the moisture that these more delicate  
**[0:32:22-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:32:22):**  higher production plants that we like to have for our own use can get established.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:32:28):**  What are some of the steps that you've learned especially in the challenging area of of caddis  
**[0:32:33-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:32:33):**  that needs to be done before you can start to integrate those more delicate varieties?  
**[0:32:39-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:32:39):**  So really needs to be present where you are in the succession of the system.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:32:44):**  So in Centropic we talk a lot about the placenta phase, placenta one, placenta two, your annuals  
**[0:32:49-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:32:49):**  and then your short-lived perennials going up to your secondary forest and then onto  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:32:54):**  you, well even you've got your early, mid, late secondary and then your climax forest.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:32:58):**  So you can't run before you can walk, do A, B, C, D through the alphabet before your X,  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:33:05):**  Y, Z and a lot of people yeah they just want to put the avocado, the lemon or the walnut  
**[0:33:10-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:33:10):**  in and walk away, there you go.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:33:12):**  But when you've got bare degraded soil you just can't do that.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:33:17):**  Luckily for us we can be producing food from you know the first few months in the placenta  
**[0:33:22-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:33:22):**  phase all the way through.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:33:25):**  So as you've both been saying, less is more, being able to focus on a much smaller area  
**[0:33:29-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:33:29):**  and manage it well while producing food within the first months with annuals but incorporating  
**[0:33:35-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:33:35):**  those perennials in with it and actually moving through succession in place has been an invaluable  
**[0:33:42-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:33:42):**  lesson for me because always where I've focused my energy on smaller areas, incorporating  
**[0:33:48-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:33:48):**  annual plants with perennials and focusing the organic matter.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:33:52):**  So maybe doing 10 metre spacing between rows of food and then all that 10 metres of biomass  
**[0:33:59-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:33:59):**  gets put onto the one metre of row of the syntropic rows rather than doing a tree row  
**[0:34:06-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:34:06):**  every four or five metres and scrambling for biomass because that is what brings you forward  
**[0:34:11-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:34:11):**  in succession that as you mentioned the accumulation phase.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:34:14):**  So I've been really humbled into that really because I've lost you know I must have lost  
**[0:34:18-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:34:18):**  a few thousand plants at the time and just seeing that first first hand and really choosing

**[0:34:34-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:34:34):**  Luckily when I was managing for five years it was someone else paying the bills and it

**[0:34:45-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:34:45):**  gone well and things that haven't gone so well and I stayed there long enough to really

**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:39:37):**  how much water can I harvest because that will then give me an idea about what I can

**[0:39:45-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:39:45):**  take care of it and that's also related to to vegetables so I have the goal of maybe  
**[0:39:53-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:39:53):**  becoming 70 maybe at some point 80 self-sufficient not sure I will be able to grow grains but

**[0:40:10-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:40:10):**  climate farmers so what I switched to is I just built a big system of using self-watering  
**[0:40:17-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:40:17):**  kind of wicking wicking pods and I connected them all to a float valve into a rain tank  
**[0:40:24-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:40:24):**  so basically I have all these all these pots that I can grow vegetables in that I don't  
**[0:40:29-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:40:29):**  need to do anything with so I left the property for one month I came back everything grew

**[0:40:39-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:40:39):**  don't want to be out here when it's when it's 40 degrees all the time watering multiple

**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:40:59):**  a big learning like I'm not I haven't set up any big vegetable beds in the garden yet  
**[0:41:03-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:41:03):**  because I know just how much work and how much water it will take to to keep things  
**[0:41:07-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:41:07):**  growing and yeah I've as I said before rather have a little bit less but do it right and  
**[0:41:15-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:41:15):**  yeah keep it alive then plant crazy amounts and be super excited but then spend all day  
**[0:41:20-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:41:20):**  there and waste all your water due to evaporation so yeah those have been my approach Jacob

**[0:47:10-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:47:10):**  out in real life as opposed to the way it looks online Jacob yeah wow yeah I've tried  
**[0:47:19-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:47:19):**  plenty of things and it's again all about context where are you supplying to say a yo  
**[0:47:27-0:47:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:47:27):**  supplying a yoga center kitchen is not a market garden for sale so I'd you know seen a lot

**[0:47:53-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:47:53):**  to produce everything as seeing what was growing well at what time of year and just focusing

**[0:48:30-0:48:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:48:30):**  route in the future and the whole swale stay I know there's a lot of swales versus keyline

**[0:49:11-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:49:11):**  I was working at in the South spend a bit more it was Mediterranean but they had water  
**[0:49:16-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:49:16):**  so they could grab avocados and other sub tropicals and they did that on a swale system  
**[0:49:22-0:49:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:49:22):**  and it was using way more much more water to just keep these trees going and producing  
**[0:49:28-0:49:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:49:28):**  than the swales were ever going to capture and then that the maintenance of those to

**[0:50:00-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:50:00):**  haven't maintained a system how are you going to design for the ease of use for it that's

**[0:50:30-0:50:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:50:30):**  really cuts out a lot of the nonsense and all of the nice things to see that look pretty

**[0:51:14-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:51:14):**  whole oh let's use gray water let's reuse water and then I saw these fancy videos about  
**[0:51:19-0:51:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:51:19):**  gray water filters and I saw this great system where you use these really big blue barrels

**[0:51:29-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:51:29):**  all these chambers and so we built one and of course we wanted to build a super nice  
**[0:51:33-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:51:33):**  one so we already built with three chambers so three big barrels and because we didn't  
**[0:51:38-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:51:38):**  really have that much slope we had to put them in the ground so I think we spend around  
**[0:51:43-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:51:43):**  four weeks of digging into really clay rocky soil getting those barrels in and filling

**[0:51:55-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:51:55):**  few days the water came out dirtier than it entered and that was really weird and so we

**[0:52:08-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:52:08):**  and it happened again and it took us a really long time to realize that the problem was  
**[0:52:12-0:52:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:52:12):**  that we just didn't have enough water flowing through the system so we had a ton of stagnant  
**[0:52:17-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:52:17):**  water in those barrels because they were designed for much bigger systems but no one tells you  
**[0:52:21-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:52:21):**  that or maybe some people do but we definitely miss that information and so we had so much  
**[0:52:26-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:52:26):**  stagnant water in them that the water that was coming out was completely disgusting and  
**[0:52:31-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:52:31):**  we couldn't use it and so in the end like we tried I don't know how many different systems  
**[0:52:37-0:52:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:52:37):**  I love prototyping and just just playing with these systems so it wasn't really a problem  
**[0:52:41-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:52:41):**  but in the end now I just use very simple mulch basins so I just have the grey water  
**[0:52:47-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:52:47):**  coming out into one area where I have a few worms that eat a bit of the leftovers that  
**[0:52:52-0:52:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:52:52):**  come from the sink and the rest can just spread in that basin and there either I plant trees  
**[0:52:56-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:52:56):**  around it or I put some seeds in it and that works fantastically so it's the simplest system  
**[0:53:02-0:53:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:53:02):**  there is zero maintenance or not zero but very very little maintenance works fantastic  
**[0:53:08-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:53:08):**  and so really the simple solutions are often kind of the best so that was the biggest wake-up  
**[0:53:15-0:53:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:53:15):**  call and since that moment I'm never putting in any fancy systems without trialing them  
**[0:53:20-0:53:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:53:20):**  first so I always test the concept does it work kind of the the general workings of what  
**[0:53:26-0:53:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:53:26):**  is described I'm building a small version of it a small model and then seeing okay this  
**[0:53:31-0:53:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:53:31):**  this can actually work and then if the concept works I might build a more fancy version but  
**[0:53:37-0:53:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:53:37):**  that's also one big learning actually those temporary solutions they are hardly ever temporary  
**[0:53:43-0:53:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:53:43):**  so now I try if it's temporary I try to build it in a way that it lasts at least two years  
**[0:53:48-0:53:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:53:48):**  so that's my like temporary version now there's a big learning and I'm really glad that especially  
**[0:53:55-0:54:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:53:55):**  through climate farmers and through the work there we've been able to talk to so many incredible  
**[0:54:00-0:54:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:54:00):**  educators around the world and so many really good people so I think if I would have started  
**[0:54:05-0:54:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:54:05):**  with this property a few years ago yeah I would have just swelled the shit out of it

**[0:54:21-0:54:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:54:21):**  to to really get it context specific yeah I would say that's the biggest thing like

**[0:57:47-0:57:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/learnings-and-reflections-from-starting-our-own-regenerative-projects-with-oliver-nick-and-jacob/#t=0:57:47):**  not going to call them failures but unscheduled learning experiences we had many of those

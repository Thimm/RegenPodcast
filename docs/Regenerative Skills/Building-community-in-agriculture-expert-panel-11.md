### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 03 Dec 2021 06:33:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:00:00):**  This is Regenerative Skills, the podcast helping you to learn the skills and solutions to create  
**[0:00:11-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:00:11):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:00:14):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gautier.  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:00:17):**  I am once again honored to be representing my friends at New Society Publishers, the  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:00:22):**  book publishers that were a big inspiration to me even before I started working with ecologies  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:00:27):**  and natural buildings and way before podcasting.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:00:31):**  Their titles like The Natural Plaster Book and Timber Framing for the Rest of Us really  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:00:36):**  made me believe that I could build my own home, which I eventually did.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:00:40):**  And later volumes like Ecopreneuring, Unlearn Re Wild, and Building Community have offered  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:00:45):**  tons of inspiration and even helped to shape my worldview.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:00:49):**  Whether you're looking for practical tips on growing and preserving food, exploring  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:00:52):**  complex challenges in your own life, or sometimes just searching for hope and inspiration in  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:00:57):**  a crazy world where you don't feel like you fit in, you'll find exactly what you're looking  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:01:02):**  for and more at newsociety.com.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:01:07):**  Welcome back everyone to the 11th of the monthly expert panel discussions, and our final panel  
**[0:01:12-0:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:01:12):**  of this year.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:01:13):**  Now, each month I've been hosting discussions and debates between some of the most prominent  
**[0:01:17-0:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:01:17):**  voices in regenerative agriculture, soil science, restoration, land management, and more.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:01:23):**  In this session I hosted a discussion on building community and agriculture with my friends  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:01:27):**  and colleagues at Climate Farmers, a non-profit organization working to build the infrastructure  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:01:32):**  to scale regenerative agriculture in Europe.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:01:36):**  In my work as the community coordinator with Climate Farmers, I've heard from so many of  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:01:40):**  the people in our network that they say they feel lonely or isolated in their work and  
**[0:01:44-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:01:44):**  in their own communities.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:01:46):**  Despite the work of many organizations to bring together growers in various regions,  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:01:51):**  many farmers still don't know where to turn for support and connection.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:01:55):**  For this panel, I was fortunate enough to be joined by three world-renowned teachers  
**[0:01:58-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:01:58):**  and farm community builders from Zimbabwe, Spain, and Germany to focus on the nuances  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:02:04):**  and challenges of building agricultural communities from their own unique experiences.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:02:10):**  We'll hear from Alan Savory of the Savory Institute and International Holistic Management  
**[0:02:14-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:02:14):**  Network, Anna De Gone from the Agri-Cultura Regenerativa Network on the Iberian Peninsula,  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:02:21):**  and Rudolf Bühler, leader of the farmers' movement BESCH and the initiator of the UN's  
**[0:02:26-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:02:26):**  peasant rights in Germany.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:02:28):**  In our talk today, we'll go into some of the key starting points in bringing farming communities  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:02:32):**  together and what it takes to sustain them in the long term.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:02:36):**  We'll go from the importance of managing communities to alternative structures, important aspects  
**[0:02:40-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:02:40):**  of rural priorities, and a lot more.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:02:43):**  Don't forget that if you want to hear the full unedited version of this interview, with  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:02:47):**  the entire Q&A session at the end, be sure to check out the different subscription options

**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:02:54):**  Since these discussions are longer than the regular weekly episodes, and I give the more  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:02:58):**  detailed descriptions of the participants in the beginning of the interview, I'll  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:03:02):**  keep the intro short and jump right into the introductions for our panelists.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:03:08):**  And with that said, I will start with the introductions for our incredible panelists  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:03:13):**  today, beginning with Ana Digón.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:03:17):**  So Ana is a freelance sociopolitical scientist, professional trainer, and interpreter, meeting  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:03:24):**  facilitator, organizer of educational and social events, writer of various publications,  
**[0:03:29-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:03:29):**  and a committed communicator in areas regarding soil, the soul, and society.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:03:35):**  Her work as an interpreter and translator has allowed her to meet, work with, and learn  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:03:39):**  from some of the greatest teachers and activists of our time, particularly in the area of regenerative  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:03:44):**  agriculture and food systems, becoming also a co-organizer of training tours for some  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:03:49):**  of these visionary leaders, as well as co-founder and coordinator for the last decade of the  
**[0:03:55-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:03:55):**  Regenerative Agriculture Association in Iberia, which is Spain and Portugal.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:04:00):**  Ana feels, above all, part of the huge and amazing web of life that we are lucky to share  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:04:05):**  and is passionate about transmitting that connection, as well as specific practical  
**[0:04:10-0:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:04:10):**  tools so that we may co-create the world that we want for our generation and future ones.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:04:17):**  And following her is Alan Savory, who is the founder and the president of the Savory Institute.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:04:22):**  He was born in Zimbabwe and educated in South Africa.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:04:26):**  He pursued an early career as a research biologist and game ranger in the British colonial service  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:04:32):**  of what was then northern Rhodesia of today's Zambia, and later as a farmer and game rancher  
**[0:04:37-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:04:37):**  in Zimbabwe.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:04:40):**  In 1992, Savory co-founded the nonprofit organization called the Africa Center for Holistic Management,  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:04:46):**  donating a ranch that would serve as a learning site for the people all over Africa.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:04:51):**  The Africa Center became the first of the Savory Institute's locally led and managed  
**[0:04:55-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:04:55):**  hubs.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:04:56):**  His book, Holistic Management, a New Framework for Decision Making, describes his effort  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:05:01):**  to find workable solutions for ordinary people who could implement and overcome many of the  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:05:06):**  problems besetting communities and businesses today.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:05:10):**  His TED Talk that he gave in 2013 has received over 8 million views, and in 2014, he was  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:05:16):**  voted one of the 50 most intriguing TED Talks of all time.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:05:20):**  The Savory Institute is one of 11 finalists of the Virgin Earth Challenge, a 25 million  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:05:24):**  initiative for the successful commercialization of ways of taking greenhouse gases out of  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:05:29):**  the atmosphere and keeping them out with no contravaling impacts.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:05:33):**  And last but not least, we have Rudolf Buhler, who is a 14th generation organic farmer on  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:05:38):**  his family farm of Sonnenhof in Germany, who after completing his degrees in agricultural  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:05:44):**  science spent six years in rural development projects in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:05:50):**  He later went on to pioneer local rare animal breeds, animal welfare standards, and eventually  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:05:55):**  the Farmers Association of Schwabian Hall, a grassroots initiative and project for rural  
**[0:06:01-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:06:01):**  development in his homeland.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:06:04):**  It's known as the oldest regional initiative and includes today more than 1,560 farms out  
**[0:06:10-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:06:10):**  of their region.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:06:11):**  In 1997, he founded the Organic Ecoland Association with regional development projects in Germany  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:06:17):**  and international organic projects under the umbrella of Seeds of Hope in India, Serbia,  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:06:23):**  Romania, Zanzibar, and others.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:06:25):**  And in 2012, he founded the House of Farmers Charity Foundation, whose aim was to develop  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:06:30):**  a charter for farmers rights, which was leading in close cooperation with other international  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:06:35):**  NGOs to the declaration of global peasants rights, which resolved in December of 2018  
**[0:06:40-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:06:40):**  in the General Assembly of the United Nations of New York.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:06:43):**  Okay, well, as you can see, we have some excellent speakers with us tonight.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:06:48):**  And I would like to start off this conversation focusing on building community in agriculture  
**[0:06:54-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:06:54):**  with the question that what are some of the first steps in facilitating and organizing  
**[0:07:01-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:07:01):**  groups towards greater cooperation?  
**[0:07:04-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:07:04):**  Perhaps Rudolf, you could start us off.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:07:06):**  Yeah, thank you.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:07:08):**  That's a good question, I have to say.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:07:12):**  And of course, I would say, farmers all over the world are quite the same, you know, is,  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:07:24):**  let's say, in a cultural approach and social approach.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:07:28):**  I have learned during my international time that was in the 70s and 80s.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:07:38):**  And to lift even in Zambia, I was two and a half years in Zambia, Alan, and close to  
**[0:07:47-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:07:47):**  Mazabuka area.  
**[0:07:49-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:07:49):**  And then also in, in Syria and Arab countries and East India, Bangladesh, so I have to say,  
**[0:08:00-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:08:00):**  farmers can, let's say easily being motivated, you know, for new challenges and new developments.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:08:07):**  But it is also part of your question.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:08:13):**  And this is, I would say, this is the main obstacle or the main thing that we get them  
**[0:08:20-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:08:20):**  organized on a sustainable manner, you know, and on a long term.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:08:27):**  And well, this is the process, which is influenced by a lot of, I would say, circumstances.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:08:37):**  Of course, first of all, I would say, farmers recognize almost best one of themselves as  
**[0:08:47-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:08:47):**  a leader, you know, less than outside persons, rather they are experts or whatever they prefer,  
**[0:08:57-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:08:57):**  or let's say they have more trust and confidence to people who are, you know, socialized among  
**[0:09:05-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:09:05):**  themselves and know their culture and their culture and so on.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:09:11):**  I think this is one important issue.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:09:13):**  And secondly is, if it comes from the idea into institutionalization, I would say, that  
**[0:09:25-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:09:25):**  it should be a suitable framework, which fits actually to several points, you know, it has  
**[0:09:35-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:09:35):**  first of all, I believe, we have to set up and to focus always on democratic principles  
**[0:09:44-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:09:44):**  that that means one member, one mode, one vote is very important.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:09:52):**  One equal rights, you know, that each farmer rather is a small or a large scale farmer  
**[0:09:59-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:09:59):**  have the same rights, and that's very important.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:10:05):**  And then we need a legal framework, actually, what I mentioned, rather cooperative or any  
**[0:10:12-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:10:12):**  other association or what else, which fits to the prevailing situation and also to the  
**[0:10:20-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:10:20):**  products which need to be sourced and sailed on get into sale.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:10:30):**  So these are some basic issues.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:10:34):**  And let's say after a few years of trial and error, it should lead into a stabilized group  
**[0:10:45-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:10:45):**  and structure and at the end, farmers have to benefit out of it, you know, and then it  
**[0:10:53-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:10:53):**  is a sustainable enterprise, you know, they have to benefit out of it.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:10:59):**  Because, you know, enthusiasm is quite nice and a few years it carries on but on the long  
**[0:11:10-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:11:10):**  term and I would say farmers association of Schwebischal, which I founded here in my home  
**[0:11:17-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:11:17):**  region 88.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:11:21):**  So it's 33 years now ago, and with eight farmers, farming families, you mentioned that we have  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:11:28):**  1560 now.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:11:32):**  This is a long go, I would say and finally, and the end, we look on on our farmers, actually,  
**[0:11:43-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:11:43):**  I'm the chairman since since the beginning, and I am not a manager, I'm just the elected  
**[0:11:50-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:11:50):**  chairman, that is very important.  
**[0:11:53-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:11:53):**  And I would say the case is in that our farmers have the right to access markets, so they  
**[0:12:06-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:12:06):**  have a guarantee that we purchase all their products, they have a guarantee on prices.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:12:14):**  And on the other hand, they have to follow the standards and to accept the control measures.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:12:20):**  So this is the, let's say, bow size commitment.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:12:25):**  Let's say the standards are organic, in most of the cases, 800, 80 are certified organic  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:12:35):**  and others are to our private standards.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:12:39):**  And this is the bow size commitment.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:12:41):**  And so our farmers are benefiting very well out of the scheme.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:12:46):**  And so that's, I think, is the goal towards sustainability, you know, to stay stable.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:12:55):**  Yeah, that's fantastic.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:12:56):**  You hit on a lot of really important things there that are fundamental to having these  
**[0:13:01-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:13:01):**  organizations work.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:13:03):**  I'm wondering, Alan, do you have some other insights on how to get these types of conversations  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:13:08):**  started and where you like to begin in your experience facilitating and organizing groups  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:13:13):**  towards greater cooperation?  
**[0:13:15-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:13:15):**  Well, when you, I was sort of dreading this, when you say, you know, with my experience,  
**[0:13:25-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:13:25):**  I know a hell of a lot of things not to do.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:13:28):**  I don't know many things what to do.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:13:31):**  We're dealing with something very complex here.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:13:35):**  Rudolph is absolutely right, you know, the local leadership, etc.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:13:40):**  And that is why the Savory Institute with its more than 50 hubs now around the world,  
**[0:13:46-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:13:46):**  they are all locally led, locally managed, so that the management is entirely in that  
**[0:13:53-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:13:53):**  language, that culture, local expertise, everything, and works to a local holistic context.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:14:02):**  So on that point, I think there's complete agreement.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:14:07):**  When we say, Rudolph says democratic, I put it, wrote that and I put a question mark.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:14:13):**  And I thought, well, does that make any difference?  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:14:18):**  Because whether dictatorships or democracies, it doesn't make any difference.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:14:22):**  The end result is the same, because they both make decisions exactly the same way.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:14:27):**  And the cause of the problem over 1000s of years, through all types of governments and  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:14:33):**  organization has been consistently the same.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:14:38):**  Humans damage the environment, their economy, and civilizations collapse.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:14:42):**  Now we're facing it globally.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:14:44):**  And so whether dictatorship or democracy doesn't seem to make a difference.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:14:50):**  And then, but what do we mean in democracy?  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:14:53):**  Well, we're really wanting diverse views, not one person's view.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:14:57):**  And we're all saying we need to mimic nature.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:15:00):**  That's coming out more and more.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:15:02):**  People are seeing that.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:15:04):**  And that's true.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:15:05):**  And when we look at nature, diversity is fundamental in the environment, in the synergy, in biological  
**[0:15:13-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:15:13):**  communities.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:15:15):**  When we look at economies that we're managing, diversity of economy, again, is an essential  
**[0:15:20-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:15:20):**  principle.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:15:22):**  Then when we look to human society, diversity of views, we find the opposite.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:15:27):**  We find the total chaos of centuries, and of 26 COP meetings now, with the world's experts  
**[0:15:35-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:15:35):**  and great diversity of views.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:15:37):**  And you see the opposite result.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:15:38):**  You see nothing, no clear leadership come out of it, no clear vision, nothing come out  
**[0:15:44-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:15:44):**  of it except chaos and confusion.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:15:47):**  So then I said, all right, so diversity is what we're wanting, but there's something  
**[0:15:52-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:15:52):**  going wrong there.  
**[0:15:54-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:15:54):**  And then when I think of this, and I think of what we're trying to do, and the short,  
**[0:16:01-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:16:01):**  very short talk I gave in that region ag group at COP26, I did point out that the source  
**[0:16:10-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:16:10):**  of the problem we're all discussing, and why we're here today, is the things we manage.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:16:18):**  That's where it's going wrong.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:16:20):**  And almost every scientist in the world now is acknowledging indirectly that management  
**[0:16:25-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:16:25):**  is the problem, not livestock, not crops, not how we produce them or anything else.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:16:31):**  And I pointed out that in that, that we produce millions of things, we produce food in all  
**[0:16:38-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:16:38):**  the ways Rudolph and I, and I'm sure Anna and everybody listening to us is promoting,  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:16:46):**  and other people promote other ways of producing food, but we don't manage that.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:16:52):**  That we produce.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:16:53):**  If we stop producing it, it stops, as it does if we stop producing electricity from nature  
**[0:16:58-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:16:58):**  or food from nature.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:17:01):**  Everything we produce comes from nature.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:17:04):**  So that's not where the problem lies.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:17:05):**  So it lies with what we manage.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:17:07):**  And we only manage three things.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:17:09):**  We manage humans, ourselves, our families, and our organisations, and then at large scale,  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:17:18):**  which is what we're all needing to talk about.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:17:22):**  We only manage through institutions, basically through governments, international agencies,  
**[0:17:29-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:17:29):**  organisations of one sort or another.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:17:32):**  And through those, we manage economies.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:17:35):**  And through those, we manage nature, or the environment.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:17:39):**  That's where all our food and everything comes from.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:17:41):**  So we manage these three things.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:17:44):**  But the three are managed through institutions.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:17:48):**  And that's where the complexity and that is causing diversity of opinion to become chaotic.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:17:56):**  So we need to be cognizant of those facts.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:17:58):**  And I'm not doomsday about it at all, because I think we've begun to understand how to deal  
**[0:18:04-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:18:04):**  with that, but by realising that the only three things humans manage cannot be managed  
**[0:18:11-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:18:11):**  independent of each other.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:18:14):**  And COVID should have taught us that now.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:18:16):**  A little virus has taught the whole world, if they didn't understand it before, that  
**[0:18:21-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:18:21):**  economy, human health, nature are totally tied together, absolutely indivisible.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:18:28):**  Well, if you're managing economy and nature through organisations, that's where the problem  
**[0:18:35-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:18:35):**  lies.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:18:36):**  And when we look at all three of the things we manage, they self renewing, they don't  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:18:42):**  stop if you stop producing, we don't produce them, we don't make them.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:18:47):**  Okay, when we look at that, and we look at the humans in institutions, we find that's  
**[0:18:54-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:18:54):**  where the problem lies.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:18:56):**  So if we can begin to focus on what producers or what or how to deal with what they call  
**[0:19:02-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:19:02):**  the wicked problems in complex human organisations, we might find a way to solve this.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:19:10):**  Now, so that's not just a lot of words for everybody.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:19:15):**  Let's bring it down to a very simple example that I use that we can all understand.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:19:24):**  The founders of our great religions had a very simple message, love and caring.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:19:31):**  And millions, billions of humans are capable of doing that, using common sense, loving  
**[0:19:37-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:19:37):**  and caring.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:19:38):**  But the moment you form a human organisation, it doesn't behave like a human.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:19:43):**  It takes on a life of its own.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:19:46):**  And it's incapable of common sense.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:19:48):**  It defends itself very seldom admits to error and goes right against its mission.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:19:57):**  So the moment we manage just our spiritual faith through organisations that led to forming  
**[0:20:05-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:20:05):**  more than 1600 branches of Christianity that have spent the last 300 years, is it?  
**[0:20:13-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:20:13):**  Killing, torturing, fighting, going to war against each other, protecting paedophile  
**[0:20:19-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:20:19):**  priests, not the children.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:20:22):**  You see, that's where it goes wrong.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:20:24):**  And that's where the diversity of opinion goes wrong.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:20:27):**  So again, then we can still overcome that if we just acknowledge these, where it's going  
**[0:20:32-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:20:32):**  wrong.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:20:33):**  Because one thing we're needing, and I think Anna, Rudolf and I would, all of us would  
**[0:20:39-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:20:39):**  agree on this, is we're wanting something that unites us for good cause, not just for  
**[0:20:47-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:20:47):**  a short time, but for centuries, like the War of the Roses that united people for 100  
**[0:20:54-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:20:54):**  years, but it was a war.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:20:56):**  And it's always war that unites us.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:20:59):**  And as soon as the war is over, we go back to fighting and arguing and everything.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:21:05):**  So democracy or dictatorship or democracies and dictatorship can unite in war.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:21:12):**  But the moment it's over, they're back to fighting.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:21:15):**  Now clearly, we don't want war to unite us.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:21:18):**  So what could unite us?  
**[0:21:20-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:21:20):**  And I think climate change could do it.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:21:22):**  And I wrote that when I wrote the first edition of our book, I said the thing that might unite  
**[0:21:28-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:21:28):**  humans for a long time is now emerging, climate change.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:21:34):**  But it's not yet uniting us.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:21:37):**  At the moment, we're just going to these conferences and getting into chaos.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:21:42):**  And I think when it unites us, this new concept that drives the addressing the root cause  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:21:52):**  of why agriculture is so destructive, and all forms of agriculture have been through  
**[0:21:57-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:21:57):**  centuries, why that is, that root cause lies in that concept of a holistic context to guide  
**[0:22:06-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:22:06):**  all our management actions.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:22:09):**  And that is tremendously uniting.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:22:12):**  Where I've worked with communities that have been totally at each other's throats and killing  
**[0:22:18-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:22:18):**  each other, literally within an hour, they've been able to unite around a common holistic  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:22:28):**  context, not a vision, not a goal.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:22:32):**  A vision or a goal doesn't unite us for long, only for a short time.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:22:37):**  But that holistic context is capable of uniting us, because it ties how we want our spiritual,  
**[0:22:45-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:22:45):**  our real, our material lives to be tied to our behavior, tied to our life supporting  
**[0:22:54-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:22:54):**  environment, that is where our food comes from, centuries from now, not in the condition  
**[0:23:01-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:23:01):**  it's in now, but in the condition it will have to be in 200, 300, 400 years from now,  
**[0:23:08-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:23:08):**  for our descendants to be living a similar life.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:23:11):**  So I think we've got a concept now that does unite us, can unite us.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:23:16):**  Now how do we get that over to adults?  
**[0:23:19-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:23:19):**  Because the idea, the concept is too simple for most adults to understand.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:23:25):**  That's a paradox.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:23:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:23:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:23:29):**  That's where we are now, in my mind.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:23:32):**  Well, this is brilliant.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:23:33):**  We're really getting deep into these initial questions.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:23:36):**  I love it.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:23:37):**  Anna, can you weigh in on this from your experience?  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:23:39):**  What are some of the first steps in facilitating and organizing groups towards greater cooperation?  
**[0:23:44-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:23:44):**  Wow.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:23:45):**  Well, first of all, thank you for the opportunity to be here today.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:23:49):**  And thank you to Rudolph and Alan for everything you've just said, because it's so rich and  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:23:54):**  full of message and of experience.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:23:58):**  And the idea you were saying, Alan, about unity, the unity that we need as a species  
**[0:24:05-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:24:05):**  and as a living reality on this planet, with this planet, no?  
**[0:24:11-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:24:11):**  We need that unity.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:24:12):**  And it's such a massive challenge.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:24:16):**  How do we bring people together?  
**[0:24:18-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:24:18):**  And those common aims that can come from common challenges are something that are right now  
**[0:24:25-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:24:25):**  an opportunity to bring us together.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:24:29):**  And in my experience, it requires generous cooperation on the part of everyone.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:24:39):**  And for that, I really feel that, and I live this as well, is what I've been seeing, is  
**[0:24:45-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:24:45):**  that it requires a profound inner transformation in people.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:24:52):**  Because if we continue to come from the paradigm that we have been educating it into, about  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:24:58):**  competing for resources and competing to be the best one and the first one to get there  
**[0:25:03-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:25:03):**  and the one that does the most and the one that earns the most, that's the old paradigm.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:25:09):**  And the new paradigm has to be about sharing and cooperation.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:25:15):**  So we need to retrain ourselves into that.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:25:19):**  We were, all of us here, born into a society that was promoting competition.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:25:24):**  And so we need to re-educate ourselves into cooperation, and that requires profound inner  
**[0:25:30-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:25:30):**  change.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:25:31):**  So for me, that's a key element in the shift in paradigm.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:25:37):**  And from my own personal experience, is where I can share from, I was very lucky that in  
**[0:25:44-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:25:44):**  2007, I was hired to interpret Darren Dougherty when he first started coming to Spain to train  
**[0:25:50-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:25:50):**  in regenerative agriculture, which at the time wasn't even coined in that way, but that's  
**[0:25:56-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:25:56):**  what it was.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:25:57):**  It was permaculture for professionals, basically.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:26:01):**  And so that, for the people who came to the courses, it was like an absolute eye-opener.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:26:07):**  It was just an absolute shift within them.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:26:09):**  And then they would go home and go, oh, well, where do I start?  
**[0:26:13-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:26:13):**  How do I apply this?  
**[0:26:16-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:26:16):**  No one around me understands what I'm talking about.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:26:18):**  It's difficult to convey.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:26:21):**  I'm the crazy person around here, and I don't even know where to start, really.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:26:25):**  So after a few years of these kinds of trainings, I realized, well, we need a network of people.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:26:32):**  People need to be supported.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:26:34):**  They cannot go home and be on their own.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:26:37):**  And so I was very fortunate as well that at the same time as I came across, as regenerative  
**[0:26:43-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:26:43):**  agriculture took me over, I was also interpreting for people who are leaders in the world of  
**[0:26:51-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:26:51):**  facilitation and, let's say, group organization in a work, and we could call it deep ecology.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:27:01):**  And so it just went click.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:27:04):**  It was like, OK, we need to change the way we relate to the soil and the land and how  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:27:08):**  we grow food, but we also need to change the way we relate to ourselves, first of all.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:27:13):**  The inner dialogue that I have with myself, what am I telling myself?  
**[0:27:18-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:27:18):**  How am I relating to others?  
**[0:27:21-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:27:21):**  How do I enter a group?  
**[0:27:23-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:27:23):**  What energy do I bring in?  
**[0:27:24-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:27:24):**  What expectations do I bring in?  
**[0:27:27-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:27:27):**  What abilities am I offering?  
**[0:27:29-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:27:29):**  What am I expecting to get back?  
**[0:27:31-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:27:31):**  And all of this, for me, it was like, OK, we need to bring those two things together.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:27:36):**  If there's going to be a paradigm shift, it has to be inner, collective, and then come  
**[0:27:43-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:27:43):**  the methodologies and the practices.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:27:46):**  And so in the courses that over the next time, firstly, when you were saying, what are the  
**[0:27:53-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:27:53):**  steps that we can take?  
**[0:27:54-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:27:54):**  For me, initially, back in those days when there was no material about all of this in  
**[0:28:00-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:28:00):**  Spanish or practically none, I started giving talks based on Darren's material, translating  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:28:07):**  that and giving talks to anyone who would listen.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:28:10):**  A council, a group of neighbours, a group of farmers, a scientific institution, whatever.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:28:16):**  I just gave talks everywhere and started collecting names and contacts of people who are interested  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:28:23):**  in this topic in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:28:26):**  And once I had enough names and enough interest with Darren, we agreed on bringing some experts  
**[0:28:35-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:28:35):**  to Spain and some of those first experts.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:28:38):**  One of them was Kurt Gatzia with his wonderful wife, Tamara.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:28:42):**  And we brought Joel Salatin, also Latin American experts like Jairo Restrepo, Nacho Simon.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:28:52):**  Later on, we worked with Professor Binedo Matado.  
**[0:28:55-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:28:55):**  So we were bringing these expert voices in because often to get something kick started,  
**[0:29:03-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:29:03):**  you kind of need a champion.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:29:06):**  You need a leader.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:29:07):**  Anyone who's got the information can communicate it and move people.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:29:11):**  And at the same time, at those events, which were a few days long, I always made sure that  
**[0:29:17-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:29:17):**  we had spaces and tools to allow people to connect with each other at another level.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:29:25):**  And I remember one guy who used to come to everything, although he was retired, he came  
**[0:29:29-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:29:29):**  to every event because he said, I really love these events because people leave their medals  
**[0:29:35-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:29:35):**  at the door.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:29:37):**  We created a space and an ambiance that allowed people to just be themselves.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:29:44):**  Because sometimes if someone says, hi, I'm John and I'm unemployed, people get an idea  
**[0:29:49-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:29:49):**  in the head of that person.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:29:51):**  But if you connect from a different space and speak from the heart and listen openly,  
**[0:29:57-0:30:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:29:57):**  respectfully, and create those spaces, then people start to communicate in a different  
**[0:30:01-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:30:01):**  way.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:30:02):**  And even in the farming community, at least in Spain, in my experience, some people are  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:30:06):**  really shy and not that prone to speaking in public.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:30:10):**  And so you have to create, it's very useful to create these spaces where people are given  
**[0:30:16-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:30:16):**  the voice and are asked to speak and participate, circles, different activities that allow everyone  
**[0:30:23-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:30:23):**  to have a voice and everyone to be heard.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:30:25):**  And this creates an atmosphere.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:30:27):**  It can be done really simply, but it creates an atmosphere where people can really connect.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:30:32):**  And so those connections then continue over time.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:30:38):**  It's completely different if you call someone, a farmer that you know and ask them for something  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:30:45):**  or ask a question, if you don't know them or if you met them in a kind of impersonal  
**[0:30:51-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:30:51):**  way.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:30:53):**  It's completely different if you met them in a way where you connected more deeply.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:30:57):**  And so there's a connection there that stays over time.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:31:01):**  And so when that call comes, it's welcome.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:31:03):**  It's, oh, it's a friend calling.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:31:06):**  So that was something that we really worked on, like very consciously creating those spaces  
**[0:31:13-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:31:13):**  and those tools.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:31:15):**  And then after some time, we realized we needed to have some kind of institution, organization,  
**[0:31:23-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:31:23):**  because you need to be legally present so that you can go and ask for a council for  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:31:29):**  a space or ask for any kind of official thing.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:31:34):**  You need to be an official body.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:31:35):**  You can't just be a person.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:31:37):**  So we created the association in 2013, the Association of Regenerative Agriculture in  
**[0:31:42-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:31:42):**  Spain.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:31:43):**  But it's a very small organization that is purely a tool.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:31:49):**  It's a legal and administrative and banking tool that allows us to do stuff.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:31:58):**  But I feel that the movement in Spain is not the association.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:32:02):**  That's just a tool.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:32:04):**  The movement is the collective.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:32:05):**  And it's all those human connections that have been made.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:32:09):**  And all of those connections lead on to many other things and many other groups springing  
**[0:32:15-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:32:15):**  up and all of these wonderful human experiences.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:32:21):**  And this is something that over the last couple of years has almost been robbed of us, is  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:32:28):**  these human experiences of meeting together and sharing in presence.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:32:33):**  And that's something we need to recover.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:32:36):**  And we need to lose the fear to come together and connect from a human level, because those  
**[0:32:42-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:32:42):**  connections are really, really strong and will take us a long way.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:32:47):**  And they build respect.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:32:49):**  And they build love and care for each other, as Alan was saying.  
**[0:32:54-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:32:54):**  And then the next stage for me, and I'll run through this quickly, is about those people  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:33:00):**  who were receiving the first trainings.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:33:04):**  In the first years, it was about training stakeholders, training agents of change.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:33:09):**  And in the beginning, just a couple of the people in each course would be a farmer, a  
**[0:33:13-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:33:13):**  professional farmer.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:33:15):**  Over the years, we're seeing how those trainings, more and more farmers are joining.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:33:20):**  And in the last trainings I've been involved in co-organizing, most of them are farmers.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:33:26):**  So there's that momentum amongst professional farmers where conventional farming doesn't  
**[0:33:32-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:33:32):**  work and organic registered farming is better, definitely, but still doesn't respond to a  
**[0:33:39-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:33:39):**  whole bunch of needs and realities.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:33:42):**  And so we need to go further.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:33:44):**  And for me, that's the regenerative vision and the regenerative practice is going further,  
**[0:33:48-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:33:48):**  way beyond.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:33:49):**  And so it was about adapting.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:33:52):**  We then had to, we've gone through a process, the farmers have gone through a process of  
**[0:33:56-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:33:56):**  adaptation of those amazing ideas and concepts that those international trainers were bringing  
**[0:34:02-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:34:02):**  to us, but then they need to be adapted locally.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:34:05):**  Every country is different.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:34:07):**  The legality is different.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:34:08):**  The soils are different.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:34:09):**  The tradition, the customs, the culture, as Alan and Rudolf were both saying, it's like  
**[0:34:13-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:34:13):**  it has to be culturally and locally appropriate.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:34:16):**  So it's in the hands of the local farmers to adapt those tools and methodologies to  
**[0:34:21-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:34:21):**  their reality.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:34:22):**  And now, after a few years, we're at a stage where there's a whole set, a whole network  
**[0:34:28-0:34:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:34:28):**  of active regenerative farmers in Spain that are pioneers, they were very brave in the  
**[0:34:34-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:34:34):**  beginning.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:34:37):**  They had the courage and they had also the friendships and support.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:34:41):**  And they now have farms that can be visited, can be seen.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:34:48):**  We try from the Association and other groups, we try to help them organize those visits.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:34:54):**  So it's not a trickle of people visiting, but they're actually, you know, again, bringing  
**[0:34:58-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:34:58):**  people together to visit a farm in an organized way, in a way that's compensating the farmer  
**[0:35:03-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:35:03):**  as well.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:35:04):**  It's a wonderful way as well to motivate the farmers.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:35:07):**  And as Rudolf was saying, it's a farmer to farmer conversations that are the most enriching  
**[0:35:13-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:35:13):**  and fertile.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:35:14):**  So that's what we need to really, really promote.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:35:17):**  So if people are thinking, well, how can I get this going in my region?  
**[0:35:21-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:35:21):**  First of all, I'd say start talking about it and start organizing small events, gatherings.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:35:27):**  There's so much material now, wonderful documentaries and films that you can use to show a film  
**[0:35:31-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:35:31):**  and then have a conversation about it.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:35:33):**  You know, and start with that.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:35:35):**  Connect with your local farmers and be patient because it is a lot of work and it involves  
**[0:35:43-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:35:43):**  a lot of presence as well.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:35:44):**  So I'll leave it at that for now.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:35:47):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:35:48):**  Look, we've now covered on some really core and fundamental things to kind of launch the  
**[0:35:53-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:35:53):**  rest of this conversation on with.  
**[0:35:55-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:35:55):**  Rudolf, I want to come back to you and something important that you were saying towards the  
**[0:35:58-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:35:58):**  end of your original statement, which is that it can be difficult to continue with the initial  
**[0:36:05-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:36:05):**  motivations and energy when you're getting a community together.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:36:09):**  And many of them make a large initial leap as they first become united based on that  
**[0:36:15-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:36:15):**  early excitement.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:36:16):**  But how have you found to maintain that momentum in the long term and keep people active and  
**[0:36:22-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:36:22):**  engaged?  
**[0:36:24-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:36:24):**  Well, this is, you know, this is, I would say, a subject you should know, you know,  
**[0:36:36-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:36:36):**  I'm working on the grassroots level myself, you know, and rather here in in in Hohenloin,  
**[0:36:44-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:36:44):**  my home area, as well as in the overseas and project in the south, I'm working always with  
**[0:36:52-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:36:52):**  let's say, with the farmers, the small scale farmers itself.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:36:57):**  And basically, we should recognize that farmers are the losers.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:37:03):**  Always rather in the south, same in the north, farmers are the losers in industrial environments,  
**[0:37:11-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:37:11):**  you know.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:37:13):**  And same with, if you look on the GMOs and so on, farmers are raped even now with the  
**[0:37:24-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:37:24):**  with their, let's say, assets they have developed through centuries is scrapped now by the multinational  
**[0:37:31-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:37:31):**  companies, you know, as Monsanto, Bayer and whatever.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:37:36):**  So we have to focus on the farmers and the local communities to give them the fair income,  
**[0:37:49-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:37:49):**  the fair share on their products, the fair share along the value chain.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:37:56):**  You know, you should recognize the richest Germans are the food dealers and the poor  
**[0:38:07-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:38:07):**  farmers they have, let's say they are just surviving it is it is I would say this all  
**[0:38:14-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:38:14):**  over the world, the same farmers are the losers.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:38:17):**  So it means, of course, farmers are much you can motivate them easily.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:38:23):**  But in the long term, we have to work on these issues that farmers get a fair share for their  
**[0:38:32-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:38:32):**  products.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:38:33):**  And they should get also, let's say, the benefit for all the site activities they provide,  
**[0:38:41-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:38:41):**  you know, let's say for the environment, for biodiversity, and so on.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:38:48):**  This is not paid through the product.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:38:51):**  So we need to get the farmer the fair income.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:38:56):**  And this is actually my personal struggle since long time that we find solutions for  
**[0:39:07-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:39:07):**  farmers I call it solidarity business, you know, farmers to join, to take to take it  
**[0:39:16-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:39:16):**  in their own hands, develop business models which fit to the farmers communities, and  
**[0:39:25-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:39:25):**  at the end that they can have a fair income.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:39:30):**  So I think this is on the long run, one of the most important issues.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:39:37):**  And fortunately, all the farmers, which I'm representing, rather here in our region, or  
**[0:39:47-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:39:47):**  let's say, Kerala, India, I have to say, we assist them in getting into organic scheme  
**[0:39:56-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:39:56):**  or even regenerative agriculture schemes.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:40:02):**  And then we offer them the double price than before, through to direct trade through to  
**[0:40:10-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:40:10):**  solitary business.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:40:12):**  And then farmers believe that you are on their side, and they have hope and trust for the  
**[0:40:21-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:40:21):**  future.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:40:23):**  So to my experience, this is one of the basic issues on the long term to give farmers opportunity  
**[0:40:31-0:40:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:40:31):**  and farmer families future.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:40:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:40:34):**  Yeah, very well said.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:40:36):**  And Alan, I would imagine that you have a management approach towards maintaining enthusiasm  
**[0:40:42-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:40:42):**  and energy as organizations begin to develop.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:40:46):**  Can you talk about the staying power that the Savery Institute has helped to initiate  
**[0:40:52-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:40:52):**  in so many different places around the world and how that's developed?  
**[0:40:56-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:40:56):**  Well, again, I dread this because I, as I keep telling you, I know so many things that  
**[0:41:04-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:41:04):**  don't work.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:41:05):**  I know that for 65 years of my adult life, since I began studying what we've now learned  
**[0:41:12-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:41:12):**  is the basic cause of the problem to now I've seen so many things that we're talking about  
**[0:41:19-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:41:19):**  that I cannot disagree with.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:41:21):**  I agree with them completely with what Rudolf is saying, what Anna is saying.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:41:26):**  But the point is, and I think they've both made it, is that you need patience.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:41:32):**  Anna was saying, you know, from 2007, when she started working with some of the people  
**[0:41:37-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:41:37):**  in region, well, that's 14 years ago.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:41:41):**  What percentage of the population, even in your Iberian area, did you represent then?  
**[0:41:48-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:41:48):**  And how many do you represent now?  
**[0:41:50-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:41:50):**  You see, it's almost none.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:41:52):**  That's why that approach we know from history and science and published papers, that will  
**[0:41:59-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:41:59):**  take 200 to 300 years till it becomes policy.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:42:04):**  Okay, with which we manage by scale.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:42:07):**  I don't think young people have got that time.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:42:10):**  Right now, when Anna said you need to shift the view, and then the methodology.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:42:17):**  I've come to the conclusion after 65 years of trying to first understand, then find a  
**[0:42:23-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:42:23):**  way to solve the problem.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:42:25):**  And then to shift the view, I've come to understand that actually, if you do it the other way  
**[0:42:31-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:42:31):**  around, it's far quicker.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:42:33):**  If you shift the methodology, the view just follows.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:42:36):**  Once you address the cause of the problem.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:42:39):**  And so everything we're discussing, and I'm not disagreeing with it, I'm not being disagreeable.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:42:45):**  I said, I agree with everything Rudolph and Anna are saying.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:42:50):**  But none of what they're saying is addressing the cause of the problem.  
**[0:42:55-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:42:55):**  So if you keep talking about the symptoms of a problem, and what you need to address  
**[0:43:00-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:43:00):**  the symptoms, we know that will take centuries.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:43:04):**  So I'm saying, why don't we go for the jugular?  
**[0:43:07-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:43:07):**  Why don't we go directly to the cause of the problem?  
**[0:43:11-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:43:11):**  And both of all of us are admitting, the cause of the problem is at a higher level.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:43:17):**  It's not at the grassroots.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:43:19):**  As I said in my talk, it's at COP, we can't cure this at the grassroots.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:43:25):**  As Rudolph said, so rightly, farmers are the losers.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:43:29):**  Every time they have been throughout history.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:43:32):**  But ultimately, agricultural policies destroy civilizations.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:43:37):**  And then farmers continue to sustain themselves, but we abandon the cities.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:43:42):**  We can't afford to do that again.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:43:44):**  So I would just be repeating here, what I said in that short talk that I sent you, that  
**[0:43:51-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:43:51):**  I think if we just address the cause of it directly, you'll find the thinking follows.  
**[0:43:57-0:43:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:43:57):**  Now, let me give you an example.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:43:59):**  So I'm not just saying that.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:44:01):**  In 80 to 84, before I started training people like Kirk, who visited you, and in that period,  
**[0:44:11-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:44:11):**  the USDA commissioned me to put 2000 scientists, World Bank economists, professors of universities,  
**[0:44:20-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:44:20):**  agricultural colleges, through training on the holistic framework I was developing.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:44:25):**  Now, never before have we had 2000 scientists for two years concentrating on the cause of  
**[0:44:32-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:44:32):**  the problem.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:44:33):**  And we broke through.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:44:35):**  And they brought hundreds of their own policies, the bureaucrats did, to the training.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:44:41):**  They analyzed their policies with the new framework.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:44:44):**  And they, not me, concluded every single one of their policies was unsound.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:44:51):**  They said it was universal.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:44:52):**  Then we found that in India, in Africa, etc.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:44:55):**  So we then learned in 1983, which is again a long time ago, that we could address that.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:45:04):**  So that's what I'm suggesting we do.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:45:06):**  Now we got a chance to do it with very divergent people at the policy level.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:45:12):**  That's why farmers suffer and everything else.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:45:15):**  And we did that a few years ago.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:45:16):**  And I wrote about it in the third edition of my textbook with 35 members of parliament,  
**[0:45:22-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:45:22):**  the actual lawmakers in Zimbabwe.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:45:25):**  Now those were two political parties making Republicans and Democrats in America look  
**[0:45:33-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:45:33):**  like friendly children playing in the playpen.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:45:36):**  I mean, they were killing each other.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:45:39):**  And people appealed to me not to even talk about agriculture and land, because it would  
**[0:45:44-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:45:44):**  lead to violence.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:45:46):**  And so I didn't.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:45:47):**  I just talked to them about how governments develop policies, whether they're dictatorships  
**[0:45:53-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:45:53):**  or anything else, how the European Union develops policies, how Spain does every country.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:46:01):**  And it's the same.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:46:02):**  And then I talked about a different way of doing so.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:46:05):**  And I said, but we cannot have governments continue to develop policies based on needs  
**[0:46:10-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:46:10):**  and desires and problems a country or region has, and then base the policy on politicians  
**[0:46:17-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:46:17):**  trying to juggle the conflicting views of agricultural experts and economic experts,  
**[0:46:23-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:46:23):**  and pressure groups and so on.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:46:25):**  And the politicians trying to find their way through that and come up with a policy, because  
**[0:46:30-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:46:30):**  always the biggest voice wins, the corporations win, the farmers lose, the country loses.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:46:37):**  Agriculture is the most destructive industry in the world today as a result of that.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:46:42):**  So I said, why don't we just do it a different way that we've learned how.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:46:46):**  And that is we first develop a context.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:46:49):**  We don't talk about the problem.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:46:51):**  Don't allow anybody to discuss the problem, the state of the land or anything, because  
**[0:46:56-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:46:56):**  those are symptoms of present policies.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:46:59):**  So we just start by saying, what do all people want?  
**[0:47:03-0:47:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:47:03):**  And almost everybody you talk to in the world, whether they're a CEO of a corporation, or  
**[0:47:09-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:47:09):**  a farmer or a pastoralist, I guarantee they want better lives, cleaner food, cleaner water,  
**[0:47:18-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:47:18):**  freedom to pursue their own spiritual and religious values, better education.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:47:24):**  They all want the same thing.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:47:26):**  And then if you describe their behavior as it will have to be for humans to be ethical  
**[0:47:30-0:47:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:47:30):**  to each other and to the environment, without which we can't be ethical.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:47:34):**  And when we describe that behavior, and then when we describe what Spain or Portugal or  
**[0:47:38-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:47:38):**  whatever country will have to be two or 300 years from now, how will the water cycle have  
**[0:47:45-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:47:45):**  to function?  
**[0:47:46-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:47:46):**  How will the energy flow through all biological communities have to function and total agreement,  
**[0:47:53-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:47:53):**  no compromise allowed.  
**[0:47:55-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:47:55):**  Once we had that total agreement, we no longer had 35 members of parliament fighting each  
**[0:48:01-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:48:01):**  other.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:48:02):**  We suddenly had 35 Zimbabweans trying to solve a problem.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:48:06):**  And within a day, we had the nucleus of a policy the world prays for.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:48:12):**  Every bit of knowledge we needed was in the room.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:48:17):**  We're not in trouble today with agriculture causing all the problems it is, desertification,  
**[0:48:23-0:48:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:48:23):**  megafires spiraling out of control, because of a lack of agricultural knowledge.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:48:29):**  We're not here because of a lack of scientific knowledge.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:48:33):**  We're only in this way because of the way that all governments develop policies.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:48:41):**  So if you attack it at that point, suddenly everybody realizes, oh my god, we all wanted  
**[0:48:48-0:48:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:48:48):**  the same thing.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:48:50):**  Let's get it.  
**[0:48:55-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:48:55):**  And I've had angry people in America swearing at me, using filthy language, telling me it's  
**[0:49:02-0:49:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:49:02):**  impossible to have an agreement in their community.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:49:07):**  And I haven't tried to shift their view and get them to be friendly and change their opinion  
**[0:49:13-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:49:13):**  or anything.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:49:14):**  I just said, will you work with me for an hour and prove me wrong?  
**[0:49:18-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:49:18):**  And they agreed to work with me and prove me wrong instead of telling me I'm wrong.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:49:22):**  And an hour later, they were in total agreement, because I avoided all of this and went straight  
**[0:49:28-0:49:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:49:28):**  for the jugular and effectively said, how do you all want your lives to be?  
**[0:49:33-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:49:33):**  Yeah, that's amazing.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:49:34):**  Great examples of uniting over the things that we have in common.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:49:39):**  And I'm sure all of the community organizers we have here can represent that and connect  
**[0:49:43-0:49:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:49:43):**  with it too.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:49:44):**  Now, Anna, what has been your experience in helping to maintain the excitement and motivation  
**[0:49:49-0:49:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:49:49):**  from initial collaboration and unification in this patient path that you've mentioned  
**[0:49:56-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:49:56):**  earlier?  
**[0:49:57-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:49:57):**  Well, that's such a big question.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:50:04):**  I'm fascinated by everything that Alan has just shared.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:50:09):**  And I really wish that we had the ears and the attention of political leaders who do  
**[0:50:18-0:50:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:50:18):**  have the power to change those policies.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:50:20):**  I often say, just give me half an hour with whoever's deciding this, because if we can  
**[0:50:28-0:50:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:50:28):**  talk about, like Alan says, what makes us happy?  
**[0:50:33-0:50:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:50:33):**  What do you want for your kids?  
**[0:50:35-0:50:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:50:35):**  The reality of what's happening, it's not about dwelling in the terribleness of it all,  
**[0:50:41-0:50:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:50:41):**  because that's easily done and it's very paralyzing.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:50:44):**  It's about, so how do we want to live?  
**[0:50:47-0:50:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:50:47):**  Exactly.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:50:48):**  And the good news is, I often say in my talks, it's all woes and terrible things with climate  
**[0:50:54-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:50:54):**  and with agriculture and everything, but actually I'm a bearer of good news is that we can do  
**[0:50:59-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:50:59):**  things differently.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:51:00):**  You really can.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:51:01):**  And it's in our hands to do that.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:51:04):**  And what I hear from farmers is that the biggest difficulty, the biggest barrier that they  
**[0:51:11-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:51:11):**  have when they want to make those changes is actually the legal framework.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:51:17):**  It's the policies.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:51:19):**  And they seem, we've had a few proposals recently here in Spain of policies that affect farmers  
**[0:51:27-0:51:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:51:27):**  that are like, who is writing these things?  
**[0:51:31-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:51:31):**  And why aren't these kinds of conversations happening with those kinds of people?  
**[0:51:38-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:51:38):**  Because we're all human, we're all on this planet.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:51:40):**  So surely if we could have these conversations, we could advance so much more.  
**[0:51:47-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:51:47):**  So for my very humble position, which is a very small group and trying to feed and inform  
**[0:51:59-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:51:59):**  and encourage and apply all of these ways of promoting life and a healthy ecosystem  
**[0:52:13-0:52:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:52:13):**  and a productive ecosystem for people.  
**[0:52:15-0:52:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:52:15):**  Well, from this position, I think it's very much about creating those spaces where people  
**[0:52:25-0:52:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:52:25):**  can connect with each other.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:52:29):**  And those spaces now with online tools and virtual tools, there's a lot more possibilities  
**[0:52:37-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:52:37):**  to communicate.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:52:38):**  But then there's also that other danger of too much information, just too much going  
**[0:52:44-0:52:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:52:44):**  on.  
**[0:52:45-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:52:45):**  And so I keep coming back to helping and supporting farmers who are making those changes and having  
**[0:52:54-0:52:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:52:54):**  those farms be places that can be showcases.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:52:59):**  And so for example, next week, we were going to a farm and having a small visit to one  
**[0:53:05-0:53:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:53:05):**  of these farms with someone who is in a political position.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:53:09):**  And we hope to show them on the farm and to then enjoy the products of the farm so that  
**[0:53:18-0:53:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:53:18):**  the person can see the whole process and can see the family that is growing this and can  
**[0:53:24-0:53:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:53:24):**  sit at the table with the family and eat.  
**[0:53:26-0:53:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:53:26):**  And those kinds of experiences and conversations that can happen there, we hope can help open  
**[0:53:34-0:53:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:53:34):**  that possibility of changing things.  
**[0:53:37-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:53:37):**  However, I feel we're in a very humble position where I wish we had access to really high  
**[0:53:44-0:53:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:53:44):**  level government people such as Alan has had in the past.  
**[0:53:48-0:53:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:53:48):**  And for example, in the last year and a half, I participated in a group of experts that  
**[0:53:54-0:53:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:53:54):**  called from Europe, from 15 countries in Europe, to talk about sustainable beef production  
**[0:53:59-0:54:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:53:59):**  in Europe.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:54:00):**  And so we were all talking about holistic management, plant grazing, regenerative methodologies.  
**[0:54:06-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:54:06):**  It was really encouraging to see that in all of these 15 countries, there's people doing  
**[0:54:11-0:54:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:54:11):**  it.  
**[0:54:12-0:54:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:54:12):**  And there's champions who are key people who maybe some of them are farmers, some of them  
**[0:54:17-0:54:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:54:17):**  are not farmers.  
**[0:54:18-0:54:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:54:18):**  They're supporting farmers.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:54:19):**  But there's these key people who are pushing and who are promoting this in all of these  
**[0:54:24-0:54:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:54:24):**  countries.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:54:25):**  So we're not alone.  
**[0:54:27-0:54:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:54:27):**  But we were asked to give a report.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:54:28):**  And when we gave the report back after a lot of work for a whole year during COVID, that  
**[0:54:35-0:54:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:54:35):**  report is actually sitting in a drawer somewhere.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:54:40):**  So it's like, you know, the tools of the disease don't prove it.  
**[0:54:52-0:54:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:54:52):**  How do we get to that level?  
**[0:54:54-0:54:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:54:54):**  If anyone has that key, I'd be really grateful for that.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:54:59):**  Well Alan's got his hand up.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:55:00):**  So I think he wants to jump in there.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:55:01):**  Go ahead, Alan.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:55:02):**  I couldn't resist.  
**[0:55:03-0:55:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:55:03):**  And, you know, again, so I love what you're saying and everything.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:55:09):**  And you said you wish we had the access to those political leaders.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:55:14):**  You do have the access, only you limiting yourself.  
**[0:55:18-0:55:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:55:18):**  So instead of spending, well no, spend time with farmers showing what can be done, etc.  
**[0:55:24-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:55:24):**  But that's going to take years.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:55:26):**  Why not just take a delegation of farmers to see your president?  
**[0:55:30-0:55:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:55:30):**  And so why don't we carry on government as usual, carry on policies as usual, but concurrently  
**[0:55:37-0:55:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:55:37):**  let us just work with a group of our people and show what can be developed in the way  
**[0:55:44-0:55:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:55:44):**  of a different policy.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:55:46):**  And if you'd like it, adopt it.  
**[0:55:48-0:55:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:55:48):**  I mean, there's nothing to stop you doing that within one week.  
**[0:55:53-0:55:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:55:53):**  That is a fabulous idea, Alan.  
**[0:55:55-0:55:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:55:55):**  I'm taking note of that.  
**[0:55:56-0:55:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:55:56):**  Definitely.  
**[0:55:57-0:55:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:55:57):**  That's great.  
**[0:55:58-0:56:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:55:58):**  I'm really hoping that these panels will lead into revolutions.  
**[0:56:03-0:56:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:56:03):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:56:05-0:56:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:56:05):**  I do see a comment there in the chat, which I have to agree with, which is about how people  
**[0:56:14-0:56:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:56:14):**  in those management and political levels are.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:56:18):**  On the one hand, some of them are very much high, as that person is saying, high on the  
**[0:56:22-0:56:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:56:22):**  psychopathic scale, and they're in positions of power.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:56:26):**  And this is a reality.  
**[0:56:28-0:56:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:56:28):**  And then there's people who are genuinely trying to change things.  
**[0:56:31-0:56:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:56:31):**  And I've got personal friends who are great activists and super motivated, have gone into  
**[0:56:36-0:56:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:56:36):**  politics to change, really change things.  
**[0:56:39-0:56:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:56:39):**  And they find themselves either completely absorbed by the machine of paperwork, stuff,  
**[0:56:45-0:56:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:56:45):**  you know, processes and all of that, and they just fall down that rabbit hole, or they leave  
**[0:56:52-0:56:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:56:52):**  in despair, you know.  
**[0:56:54-0:57:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:56:54):**  And so it's like the good people don't get to really make those changes.  
**[0:57:00-0:57:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:57:00):**  So yeah, it's definitely a challenge.  
**[0:57:03-0:57:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:57:03):**  Huge.  
**[0:57:04-0:57:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:57:04):**  Back to you, Oliver.  
**[0:57:06-0:57:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:57:06):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:57:07-0:57:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:57:07):**  Okay, so let's put a little comma on that right now.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:57:09):**  There are a couple of people here who have been patiently waiting to ask their questions,  
**[0:57:13-0:57:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:57:13):**  and I would love to hand it over to our listeners.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:57:15):**  So first we have Alex.  
**[0:57:18-0:57:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:57:18):**  All right, there you have it, everyone.  
**[0:57:21-0:57:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:57:21):**  Now as great as it is to include multiple experience perspectives on the topics that  
**[0:57:25-0:57:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:57:25):**  we covered in this panel, it's impossible to include the full range of opinions and  
**[0:57:29-0:57:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:57:29):**  viewpoints out there.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:57:30):**  And that's why I'm inviting you to join the growing community building regenerative skills  
**[0:57:34-0:57:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:57:34):**  to use in their daily lives.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:57:36):**  Now it'll always be free to join, all you have to do is follow the links to our Discord  
**[0:57:40-0:57:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:57:40):**  on the homepage of the Regenerative Skills website, as well as our Instagram account.  
**[0:57:44-0:57:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:57:44):**  And the benefit of joining through our Discord channel is that unlike social media platforms  
**[0:57:48-0:57:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:57:48):**  that mine your personal data and manipulate your feeds based on algorithms just to sell  
**[0:57:52-0:57:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:57:52):**  you more junk, I founded these channels purely for knowledge, skill, and story exchange between  
**[0:57:57-0:58:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:57:57):**  the people who care to make their worlds better for everyone.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:58:01):**  This week's question, which we'll be discussing on the forum is, how have you observed the  
**[0:58:05-0:58:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:58:05):**  evolution of rural communities during your lifetime?  
**[0:58:09-0:58:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:58:09):**  What unique concerns and priorities do farmers and their communities require that differ  
**[0:58:13-0:58:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:58:13):**  from urban areas?  
**[0:58:15-0:58:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:58:15):**  And what can those of us do who don't live in the countryside to support the rural communities  
**[0:58:20-0:58:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:58:20):**  that we depend on and value?  
**[0:58:23-0:58:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:58:23):**  Now I've worked in a wide variety of communities from isolated rural areas to inner cities  
**[0:58:27-0:58:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:58:27):**  and many aspects of the spectrum in between, and I've always tended to feel more comfortable  
**[0:58:32-0:58:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:58:32):**  and more at home in small country communities.  
**[0:58:35-0:58:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:58:35):**  Yet in most regions, these towns are in severe decline due to a number of factors from mechanized  
**[0:58:41-0:58:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:58:41):**  farm work to large companies out-competing local businesses.  
**[0:58:45-0:58:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:58:45):**  There are so many opportunities though for the right type of person to have a tremendously  
**[0:58:49-0:58:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:58:49):**  positive impact on a small rural town, and this topic precisely will be a large focus  
**[0:58:55-0:58:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:58:55):**  of the next season of this podcast, and I'll explain more about that later.  
**[0:58:59-0:59:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:58:59):**  So don't forget, you can also help to guide the panel discussions that I've got planned  
**[0:59:03-0:59:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:59:03):**  for the future by suggesting topics and guests on the Discord forum as well.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:59:08):**  Now that's our show for this week.  
**[0:59:09-0:59:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:59:09):**  Until next time, keep taking those little steps every day towards a regenerative future,  
**[0:59:14-0:59:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/building-community-in-agriculture-expert-panel-11/#t=0:59:14):**  and I'll be right by your side along the way.

**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:02:23):**  We're looking forward to seeing you here.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:02:27):**  Welcome everybody, this is an interview that I have been looking forward to for a while  
**[0:02:30-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:02:30):**  now.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:02:31):**  I was fortunate enough to speak with two guests from opposite sides of the spectrum of permaculture  
**[0:02:35-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:02:35):**  learning.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:02:36):**  Now the first, Jeff Lawton, one of the original students of Bill Mollison and a permaculture  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:02:41):**  designer and teacher for more than 30 years.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:02:44):**  And the second, Sam Parker-Davies, an intern with Jeff at Zaytuna Farm in Australia who  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:02:49):**  has jumped in deep with permaculture learning, especially at the community level.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:02:54):**  In this interview, we talked in depth about the challenges and points of inspiration from  
**[0:02:58-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:02:58):**  each perspective experience.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:00):**  Jeff talks about inspiring regenerative projects at the community level and what it takes to  
**[0:03:04-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:04):**  get the ideas to really stick.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:07):**  Sam discusses his experience getting involved in local politics and even running for a seat  
**[0:03:11-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:11):**  on the city council.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:14):**  Jeff and I also talk about his experience and memories from working in our region of  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:17):**  Guatemala many years ago with our friends at IMAP, the Mesoamerican Institute of Permaculture,  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:23):**  and gives great advice on gathering information and observing a site in depth before making  
**[0:03:28-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:28):**  assumptions.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:29):**  This is a great and nuanced discussion from both ends of the spectrum and I'm sure anyone  
**[0:03:33-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:33):**  out there can relate to it on some level.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:36):**  So from here, I'll turn things over to Jeff and Sam.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:40):**  So I'm joined today with Jeff Lawton and Sam Parker-Davies.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:44):**  How are you guys doing today?  
**[0:03:45-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:45):**  Good.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:46):**  Yeah, good.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:47):**  Thanks Oliver.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:48):**  Yeah, thanks so much for being with us today.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:49):**  Now I've got tons of questions for the both of you, but before we get started, could each  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:52):**  of you introduce yourselves a little bit and tell us how you got first into permaculture  
**[0:03:58-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:58):**  because I know your journeys are at very different points right now.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:01):**  So starting with Sam.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:03):**  Go ahead.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:04):**  So my name is Sam Parker-Davies.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:07):**  I was born in the Blue Mountains of Australia and ever since I was little, I wanted to be  
**[0:04:14-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:14):**  an environmental scientist.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:15):**  So it's something that's been with me for a long, long time.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:19):**  My grandmother did permaculture, but it was something that kind of came and blips on the  
**[0:04:24-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:24):**  radar.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:25):**  I remember in year eight watching this video that gave me so much hope in a depressed state.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:31):**  I was really down and a geography teacher showed us this video about this man greening  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:36):**  the desert somewhere in Jordan and wanting to go to the Middle East from a very young  
**[0:04:41-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:41):**  age.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:42):**  It kind of like sparked so much life and hope and heart inside of me.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:48):**  From there, I went forward and I was very active, very passionate about creating change  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:56):**  and permaculture completely left my mind.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:05:00):**  I didn't realize anything I was doing had anything to do with that until when I was  
**[0:05:05-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:05:05):**  18, I ran for council and a permaculture teacher in my town took me aside and told me about  
**[0:05:14-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:05:14):**  permaculture.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:05:16):**  She's very much about the revolutionary side of social permaculture, about how we can create  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:05:22):**  different social structures to change the world, which was what my campaign was about,  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:05:28):**  was about how we can create empowered community to change the living structures in the local  
**[0:05:34-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:05:34):**  situation.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:05:35):**  So she educated me in permaculture and completely opened my whole world to this connected mass  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:05:42):**  of people doing incredible things for the planet, completely changing our trajectory  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:05:47):**  and paving a way forward that gives me so much life, so much hope and fuels my ambition  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:05:52):**  to do all the work that I can to aid this amazing cause.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:05:57):**  Now I'm living with Jeff after trying to support and sustain myself in the Blue Mountains  
**[0:06:02-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:06:02):**  off running workshops for kids and adults in my little tent in my backyard so that I  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:06:11):**  didn't have to pay rent and so I can make whatever income I could.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:06:15):**  And so now I'm here seeking a wider education so that I can do the most good I can in the  
**[0:06:21-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:06:21):**  world going forward.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:06:22):**  Marvelous!  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:06:23):**  That's a really quick trajectory in a short time.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:06:25):**  Now Jeff, tell us about your background.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:06:27):**  Well, I was born in England.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:06:31):**  I grew up with a lot of interest in the environment and natural systems and most of my hobbies  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:06:39):**  and pastimes relate to something to do with the environment.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:06:44):**  But I was 16 in 1970, so I lived through the 70s as an adolescent young adult and with  
**[0:06:54-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:06:54):**  all the dreams of a new world and an alternative world, a counterculture.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:07:03):**  Reality kicked in as it does, especially in England when you're not an academic.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:07:12):**  And my trade ended up being mechanical engineering.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:07:19):**  And at a certain point, I got introduced to surfing in the West Country and started to  
**[0:07:28-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:07:28):**  travel and visited a lot of places where we could live longer in the winter and escape  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:07:36):**  the English winter in a warm surfing type location.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:07:41):**  And with that came a lot of Australian connections and Australian friends.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:07:48):**  I ended up emigrating to Australia in 1979 and within the first 12 months, I realized  
**[0:07:55-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:07:55):**  I could work very hard and buy a farm, which was something that was unheard of in England  
**[0:08:02-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:08:02):**  at that time.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:08:05):**  But I also got introduced to the very early permaculture movement and I just happened  
**[0:08:11-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:08:11):**  to settle in an area in the Sunshine Coast, southern Queensland, where the largest permaculture  
**[0:08:18-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:08:18):**  group in the world was in action.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:08:19):**  It's only 150 people and Max Lindegger was a champion of that group.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:08:26):**  And that led me to take an introduction course and get involved.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:08:34):**  As I was aiming as a hardworking immigrant to this country, I was determined to make  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:08:42):**  enough money to buy a farm, which I knew was possible with this large landscape.  
**[0:08:48-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:08:48):**  That led me to take a course with Bill Mollison in 1983 in Tasmania and purchased my first  
**[0:09:01-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:09:01):**  property after a few entrepreneurial events of just generally building up work in businesses  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:09:08):**  and selling them on so I could buy a farm.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:09:12):**  And then the real learning started and I didn't teach until for eight years.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:09:20):**  It was 1991 before I started teaching, but I quickly realized that I seemed to have a  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:09:28):**  talent as a teacher and I got offered aid work overseas.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:09:33):**  I reconnected with Bill when he moved from Tasmania to northern New South Wales, only  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:09:39):**  four hours away, which is not far in Australia by car.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:09:43):**  And then I was offered aid work and more aid work and as I got successful results, more  
**[0:09:48-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:09:48):**  consultancy eventually, when Bill wanted to retire back to Tasmania, he offered me the  
**[0:09:54-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:09:54):**  directorship to manage the Permaculture Institute in northern New South Wales.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:10:01):**  The rest is history.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:10:02):**  I just kept getting more and more results.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:10:06):**  It was 1991 when I opted out of the conventional system and decided I was never going to compromise  
**[0:10:11-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:10:11):**  with conventional business and standard modem operandi of living in the consumption world.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:10:24):**  I was only going to work as a permaculture teacher, consultant, aid worker and project  
**[0:10:29-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:10:29):**  manager and that's what I've been doing ever since.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:10:37):**  That just led on with resources gathering around me, most of them people and some of  
**[0:10:43-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:10:43):**  them wonderful young people like Sam who sat right here next to me.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:10:49):**  I'm so lucky to have such a fantastically large broad team and most of them, a lot of  
**[0:10:58-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:10:58):**  them today are in the IT field because we do a lot of online education and social media  
**[0:11:06-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:06):**  and these sort of things.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:08):**  Yeah, your outreach has gotten really good.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:10):**  In fact, I was on your last online PDC in order to brush up on some of my skills and  
**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:16):**  get an idea for how you guys work on an online platform and it's a really tight program.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:21):**  I've been impressed.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:22):**  Now your trajectory has been fantastic and it leads me into the next question that's  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:26):**  actually coming from my friend and colleague Shad Goodsy, the owner of Atitlan Organics,  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:31):**  which is an eight year old off-grid permaculture farm here on Lake Atitlan just up the hill  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:35):**  from us and you might even remember them because you highlighted them on social media a lot,  
**[0:11:40-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:40):**  not a whole lot long ago.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:42):**  Now he asked what aspects of permaculture after about a 30 year trajectory of working  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:48):**  in the field are you still most inspired to explore after all these decades of planting  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:53):**  tons of trees and gardens and reshaping landscapes?  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:58):**  What part of this is still pushing you to do more research and continue to push the  
**[0:12:03-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:12:03):**  boundaries of ecosystem regeneration?  
**[0:12:06-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:12:06):**  The whole systems, the social systems, the same as Sam's wonderful experience as a 20  
**[0:12:17-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:12:17):**  year old.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:12:18):**  I was 64 year old this year.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:12:20):**  We're at either end of the age groups.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:12:25):**  Starting local permaculture community groups is something I'm very passionate about and  
**[0:12:31-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:12:31):**  I've got back into it and we're developing a startup kit for anywhere in the world for  
**[0:12:38-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:12:38):**  areas defined by local government where local government influences what we can do.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:12:47):**  That's very much an exciting area and I'm also involved in setting up permaculture eco  
**[0:12:56-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:12:56):**  farming hamlets like Zaytuna Farm which is now transiting towards that type of setup.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:13:08):**  Designing the community on the ground because I love farming.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:13:10):**  I'm a really practical person.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:13:12):**  I love being on the ground and particularly in the perennial systems and food forests  
**[0:13:18-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:13:18):**  etc. but local community groups is such a courageous thing to engage in.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:13:27):**  I have one that's over 25 years old that has evolved over time and has bred other groups.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:13:33):**  That's a model that I'm continuing to refine and extend.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:13:40):**  Now I want to be able to offer a startup kit for anybody to take the same system going  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:13:48):**  forward.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:13:49):**  We need one in every local government area on this planet as an example of the people  
**[0:13:56-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:13:56):**  who vote in a government and what they actually need to express their needs.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:02):**  Absolutely, yeah that is very inspiring.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:05):**  Now the flip side for you Sam, just getting started in your permaculture career, where  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:10):**  do you draw your inspiration from and where do you really want to move towards going forward?  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:16):**  I'm definitely inspired by Jeff's work Greening the Desert.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:21):**  Bioremediation and desertification work in so far as the landscapes is definitely something  
**[0:14:28-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:28):**  I want to learn as much as I can about.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:30):**  Fungi being such an unexplored area, so anything I can learn to help pillaged and destroyed  
**[0:14:36-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:36):**  landscapes because they're growing.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:39):**  Anything that can be done to regenerate these things into places that help animals, plants  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:45):**  and people to thrive and to do well for nature to be at its optimum, to create an abundance  
**[0:14:51-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:51):**  on earth that pulls my heart in the biggest way.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:53):**  So therefore food forests.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:56):**  That in so far as the extent of that I think people are what's going to make it happen.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:01):**  So this is the passion that pulls me the most, is the way that we can create people ecosystems  
**[0:15:07-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:07):**  like Jeff's 25 year old social food forest in the Sunshine Coast.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:13):**  To have these models spreading further and further where we can have interactive communities  
**[0:15:18-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:18):**  that know each other, that support each other just like a diverse ecosystem.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:21):**  That can look after each other and connected by a web.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:26):**  These things are invaluable as we move forward.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:30):**  Isolation just isn't going to cut it.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:31):**  People doing things by themselves aren't going to make the impact that needs to be made.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:36):**  So the more we can do in connecting people in a common cause, giving people hope and  
**[0:15:40-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:40):**  letting them know that this is actually something that has momentum and is moving forward.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:46):**  That no one doing this work is isolated.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:49):**  No one who has these hopes and dreams is alone.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:51):**  This is the most essential thing for me.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:55):**  So the more we can actually create opportunities for food forestry and global abundance.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:16:04):**  Wonderful Sam.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:16:05):**  Yeah, that's really well said and I really echo both of your passion towards the community  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:16:10):**  and the social side of working with people to advance these permaculture goals.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:16:14):**  Now beyond the physical conventions in the land, the structures and the barriers that  
**[0:16:19-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:16:19):**  prevent some of our ambitions on land-based projects, taking the next step and creating  
**[0:16:25-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:16:25):**  communities to advance your vision comes with a lot of intricacies and challenges as well.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:16:33):**  How have both of you found success in working at the community and the personal level to  
**[0:16:38-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:16:38):**  help to advance this goal of landscape regeneration and healthier economies and communities?  
**[0:16:44-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:16:44):**  Well a lot of it's about tolerance and being able to listen to what people need.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:16:53):**  Unlike any design, it's a matter of allowing your group to demonstrate its evolutions.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:16:59):**  So you have to allow the ecosystem to evolve, whether it's a food forest or it's a food  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:17:08):**  forest of people.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:17:12):**  Could you clarify that idea?  
**[0:17:14-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:17:14):**  Tell me what you mean by a food forest of people.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:17:18):**  It doesn't work if you have everybody from the same age group and subculture.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:17:23):**  It has to be a diversity of people, so that way you influence local politicians.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:17:29):**  So when a local politician comes into a room where 100 people meet once a month, there's  
**[0:17:35-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:17:35):**  always at least 100 people, and there's every age group of people, every profession of people.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:17:41):**  There's people from different backgrounds and there's people from different socioeconomic  
**[0:17:49-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:17:49):**  areas.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:17:51):**  It's a great diversity and that's what looks like a massive voting block because the politician  
**[0:17:56-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:17:56):**  then sees every person in that room.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:17:59):**  There's 20 voters who think the same way, so they better understand what you're about,  
**[0:18:05-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:18:05):**  otherwise they're looking political death in the eye.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:18:08):**  So it's one way of passively holding our politicians accountable.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:18:13):**  They need to know what you're about and why you meet as a regular well attended group  
**[0:18:21-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:18:21):**  of people and what you then do.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:18:24):**  What you do is you listen to each other and what is required.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:18:29):**  People may meet and they say, well, we're growing all this stuff, we've passed on information,  
**[0:18:37-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:18:37):**  you might have some ground rules like we meet at the same time every month at the same place.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:18:45):**  We keep information about what has been successful and what has failed so we can share that information.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:18:53):**  We keep education at the center of the group with the PDC, the Permaculture Design certificate  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:18:58):**  course as the main education component.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:19:02):**  And that can be a part time course, so everybody's a local who attends.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:19:05):**  But then there can be all these different specialist courses.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:19:11):**  We keep promoting permaculture in home gardens, small acreage, large farms, streetscapes and  
**[0:19:17-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:19:17):**  even industrial areas.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:19:19):**  But then you might then find that once you start developing, and I think you will find  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:19:26):**  that people will say, well, we might be growing all these new things and developing all this  
**[0:19:31-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:19:31):**  stuff but how do we process it or what are the best recipes to create to cook this stuff  
**[0:19:41-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:19:41):**  or preserve this stuff or ferment this stuff.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:19:43):**  So those are extra workshops.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:19:45):**  That ends up being cooking workshops, processing workshops.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:19:50):**  But that also ends up being a recipe book for the local group and the local area and  
**[0:19:56-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:19:56):**  it has a place and a date on it, at least a month.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:01):**  So it's the place where the group is centered with 12 months of the year, one recipe book  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:09):**  for each month because in that month only certain things are ripe.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:14):**  Some things are ripe all the time but some things are only ripe in a certain period of  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:17):**  time and then all the recipes are relevant.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:21):**  So that is an evolution which often is requested.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:24):**  So in many groups you have that local recipe book created that has a place and month of  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:32):**  the year relevant, 12 recipe books.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:36):**  And on you go, listening to what your local community required, just like you look at  
**[0:20:41-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:41):**  the responses of a perennial ecosystem, i.e. a food forest, and see what grows well in  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:48):**  the shade and what doesn't, what needs more sun, what grows in little open spaces, what  
**[0:20:53-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:53):**  are the better climates, what are the better fruit trees, etc. etc.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:56):**  And you extend on successes and you reduce failures.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:59):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:00):**  Do you have anything to add to that, Sam?  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:03):**  Have you discovered any barriers or challenges when you are working on a community scale  
**[0:21:08-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:08):**  or social scale in helping to promote permaculture within communities?  
**[0:21:14-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:15):**  I think a prime example is living at Jeff's farm.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:19):**  Community living, when you're not accustomed to it, is hard.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:22):**  There's lots of things that you have to learn about yourself and about interacting with  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:26):**  people that has to happen quickly because people are diverse.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:31):**  We have from here people from all over the world with all different persuasions.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:35):**  The only thing connecting and uniting them being permaculture.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:39):**  And this is the same throughout the whole world now as our cultures diversify and become  
**[0:21:46-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:46):**  broader and broader insofar as the people that it contains.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:49):**  So we have to learn to adapt.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:51):**  We have to learn to be like our forests, which is tying back into a discussion before with  
**[0:21:56-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:56):**  what a social food forest is.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:59):**  It's an abundant social system is how I understand it and say it.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:02):**  We don't want to create social deserts.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:04):**  We don't want to create social monocultures where everyone nods and just allows things  
**[0:22:07-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:07):**  to happen, which is what we've seen.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:10):**  We see a situation where people don't feel that they have power to grow and diversify  
**[0:22:15-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:15):**  themselves.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:16):**  They don't have the power to be abundant like a forest or to create the things that they  
**[0:22:23-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:23):**  need to see and do in the world.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:25):**  We might have a constitution of generally how we behave like the grand rules, the basic  
**[0:22:30-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:30):**  grand rules, but then we might have bylaws and we agree on bylaws.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:34):**  They can be flexible.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:35):**  And here it's like there are things like, you know, we switch roles at times.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:41):**  We work on small animals, we work on large animals, we work on crop systems, we work  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:45):**  on natural fertilizer, we work on nursery systems, we work on food forests, we work  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:51):**  on infrastructure, and then we switch around.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:56):**  But we also work on, there are times when we all work together before breakfast for  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:01):**  two hours and then we have three meals a day together.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:05):**  You know, there's an average of 30 people on this property, so we serve from our kitchen  
**[0:23:11-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:11):**  30,000 meals a year.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:16):**  And not everybody's a meat eater, but many are.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:18):**  I'm a meat eater and Sam's a vegan, but we eat together.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:23):**  It's okay.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:24):**  We tolerate each other over that.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:25):**  And Sam knows animals are processed and that's okay.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:30):**  And we don't attack each other over it.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:33):**  But we all clean together and we all agree how we use the compost toilets and we all  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:38):**  agree how we behave and we agree on what we don't do.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:42):**  We don't have alcohol and drugs on the property because everybody needs to have a clear head.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:45):**  We're all very serious about what we do.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:47):**  We agree on when we use the washing machine, let's say, because we're completely off-grid.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:54):**  We're all on battery solar.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:56):**  Here we have nickel-iron battery banks and lots of solar panels.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:59):**  But we all know that you can't use ridiculous amounts of electricity once the sun's gone  
**[0:24:03-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:03):**  down.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:04):**  And we're all on our own drinking water and we're all on compost toilets and we're all  
**[0:24:08-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:08):**  on reed bed grey water.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:10):**  There are obvious rules of how you work with that.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:14):**  And it's pretty obvious if you don't understand it, people will help you.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:18):**  And if it doesn't work for you, then you're not going to fit in.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:22):**  And that's okay.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:24):**  That's fine.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:25):**  Some people won't.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:26):**  That's all right.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:27):**  So we've got those things sort of worked out, I think.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:30):**  I'll just quickly expand on other challenges in living in community or doing community  
**[0:24:37-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:37):**  projects can be our own conditioning and our own bias, which is something we need to really  
**[0:24:43-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:43):**  hold ourselves accountable for.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:47):**  When I ran for council, I had this understanding or this bias towards the council and towards  
**[0:24:55-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:55):**  politicians.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:56):**  I had this idea that it was all their fault, the situation that we were in.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:25:01):**  And it was a really steep learning curve because people who are invested in the local council  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:25:09):**  don't want to hear your criticism and will take you down if you say it too loud.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:25:15):**  And so it became a real awareness for me that for me to utilize permaculture teachers to  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:25:23):**  see the problem as the solution to work with nature's strengths rather than against it  
**[0:25:28-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:25:28):**  and seeing the council as like a dense jungle that I've got to somehow find my way into  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:25:35):**  or a big open desert that I've got to secure some sort of water in.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:25:41):**  I had to adapt myself to that situation and become compassionate and understanding of  
**[0:25:48-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:25:48):**  people's worldviews.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:25:49):**  I was standing outside a ticketing booth with people of all different cultural and political  
**[0:25:57-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:25:57):**  orientations handing out tickets and having, from what I understood, was ultimately they  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:26:05):**  wanted the best things that they understood to be for the world.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:26:10):**  Someone wanted it through money and jobs, another wanted it through environmental protection,  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:26:13):**  another wanted it from unions, whatever.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:26:17):**  It was just different language, different lingo and a different understanding for the  
**[0:26:22-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:26:22):**  same thing that they felt that they couldn't implement and therefore a politician had to.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:26:27):**  I found living in this community, as long as living in other communities, that the more  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:26:35):**  empowered people are to just do what they feel they need to do in order to support and  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:26:40):**  help the world, the more there's a common culture of caring for one another because  
**[0:26:45-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:26:45):**  you know one another, because you see another go through and are isolated in your own apartment  
**[0:26:51-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:26:51):**  or your own box, not knowing your neighbour, the more you can create a culture of care  
**[0:26:55-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:26:55):**  and connection and empowerment.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:26:58):**  The more things just get done rather than relying on a government to do it.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:02):**  I think that this is one of the biggest challenges we face, is a common idea or a common culture  
**[0:27:06-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:06):**  of blame.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:07):**  Well, I think that's a remarkable insight and an incredible opportunity to have gotten  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:12):**  an experience with so early in your learning.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:16):**  My question then would be, what is the challenge of getting regenerative land management, permaculture  
**[0:27:21-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:21):**  and economic policies implemented on a government level?  
**[0:27:25-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:25):**  I know at this point you've both mentioned that it's something that needs to happen,  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:29):**  but do you find it more worthwhile to go directly to that channel or better perhaps to stay  
**[0:27:34-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:34):**  focused on grassroots initiatives?  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:36):**  I think you've got to set examples because we're in the information age and we're in  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:41):**  the YouTube age and the Facebook age and the Instagram age and everything's high definition  
**[0:27:47-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:47):**  even out of a phone.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:50):**  The evidence is obvious and in every way.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:56):**  Your glory shots of regeneration, your glory shots of recovery, your glory shots of community  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:04):**  are all believable out of a mobile smartphone today.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:08):**  That's gone right out through the world, through every community, even some of the poorest  
**[0:28:12-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:12):**  and some of the most remote.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:14):**  So, it obviously is seen by government and it's at a stage where it can't really be ignored.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:22):**  So, we can stay at grassroots and still be global.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:26):**  I would say grassroots is the only real way to make things happen.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:30):**  Like before, saying that we live in a common culture of blame or that that seems to be  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:36):**  the biggest inhibitor is just that, is the more we can step out of blame and more into  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:42):**  affirmative action of just doing because it's what the world needs and because what will  
**[0:28:47-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:47):**  satisfy us, give us greater happiness and greatest joy in our lives.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:53):**  It's a good reason to do anything really, especially something that makes the world  
**[0:28:57-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:57):**  incredible.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:58):**  So, for us to take affirmative action for ourselves is I think much more powerful worldwide  
**[0:29:05-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:05):**  than a government doing it.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:07):**  Well, it also seems to me like it's a good sort of litmus test or kind of a way of finding  
**[0:29:13-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:13):**  out whether your initiatives or your projects can really take root in a community is by  
**[0:29:20-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:20):**  trying them out first at the personal level and seeing how it's adopted and if it continues  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:27):**  to move forward with any steam sort of after the initial excitement of getting a project  
**[0:29:32-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:32):**  started.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:33):**  And then maybe from there, once the concept is proven, it's something that you can take  
**[0:29:37-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:37):**  to a higher platform.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:39):**  Yeah, what's that all about?  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:42):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:43):**  But if we can do it in a seditious way, then that's fine too.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:49):**  We don't need the government to do what we need to do.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:51):**  Of course.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:52):**  And it's kind of very hard for them to stop us as well, especially if we do it en masse.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:57):**  But at the same time, I understand if we were to do a social site analysis and we see the  
**[0:30:07-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:30:07):**  government or the council as a climatic factor or some sort of factor affecting us, then  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:30:16):**  we must use that to our benefit.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:30:20):**  And this is where the resources, connections to council can be a beautiful, wonderful thing  
**[0:30:27-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:30:27):**  where them supporting and actively engaging in what we're doing is not something we should  
**[0:30:33-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:30:33):**  ever say no to, which is why these projects on the ground, these grassroots projects to  
**[0:30:41-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:30:41):**  have government engagement happening in some places, not happening in others, but even  
**[0:30:48-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:30:48):**  just a twinkle of it is a more than exciting thing.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:30:52):**  Yeah, those are some great insights.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:30:55):**  And now that we've talked a lot about some of the larger ideas of moving forward with  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:30:59):**  communities and instilling inspiration and kind of spreading these ideas, let's take  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:04):**  a little step back now and talk about some of the technical aspects that make these things  
**[0:31:09-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:09):**  happen.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:10):**  Now, Jeff, I know that you came to Guatemala quite a few years back and I'm specifically  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:14):**  wondering what your impression of the country here was and some of your thoughts on the  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:19):**  relevance, especially of permaculture to the indigenous communities here in Guatemala,  
**[0:31:24-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:24):**  because there are very few countries around the world that still have such a high percentage  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:29):**  of the population of indigenous people who are still connected to their traditions and  
**[0:31:34-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:34):**  their culture.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:35):**  Oh, well, I think it's extremely relevant that the land distribution, as I understand  
**[0:31:44-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:44):**  it, and it was a while ago I was there, was something that was quite restrictive.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:50):**  People were walking a very long way to small blocks of land from very small blocks of land  
**[0:31:55-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:55):**  within town.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:57):**  And they kind of lost concentration on the very small blocks of land.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:32:01):**  And most people were involved in a coffee culture.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:32:07):**  So there was a sort of small sort of two-acre coffee culture mentality where people sort  
**[0:32:15-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:32:15):**  of felt that to be rich was to do well in coffee, and all the blocks were a long way  
**[0:32:21-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:32:21):**  from where people lived.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:32:25):**  And that made things quite awkward.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:32:30):**  But in the early stages, we were able to encourage people to go not only organic but into more  
**[0:32:39-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:32:39):**  diverse systems that are nice, simple but elegant food forest-type assemblies to at  
**[0:32:49-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:32:49):**  least make their small coffee plantations more sustainable.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:32:57):**  There was obviously enormous amounts of land that was way too steep being cultivated, as  
**[0:33:04-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:04):**  I remember, and just those difficulties with the way the land was distributed and the way  
**[0:33:11-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:11):**  people had got used to walking so far out to their blocks.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:15):**  No, that's a pretty accurate description of many of the challenges that are still going  
**[0:33:19-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:19):**  on in this region.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:20):**  Now, obviously it's an extremely diverse country and one of the most biodiverse regions anywhere  
**[0:33:25-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:25):**  in the world, but you described it very well, especially where we are, that that is one  
**[0:33:30-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:30):**  of the continuing challenges of this region.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:33):**  These cafetal systems, which are all over the valley in Sununna where we live here as  
**[0:33:38-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:38):**  well, that are kind of minimally tended and harvested once, sometimes twice a year depending  
**[0:33:44-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:44):**  on the season and the breed.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:47):**  And I'm working with a lot of organizations, especially Atitlan Organics and EMAP, which  
**[0:33:53-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:53):**  you helped to found back in the 90s, if I remember correctly.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:58):**  And both of those organizations are really pushing forward to help polyculture and more  
**[0:34:04-0:34:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:34:04):**  diverse systems within the cash crop model of coffee production, as well as the production  
**[0:34:11-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:34:11):**  of some more indigenous food sources, as well as seed saving.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:34:15):**  So could you tell us a little bit about how you first got the Mesoamerican Institute of  
**[0:34:21-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:34:21):**  Permaculture started and how that process really took hold?  
**[0:34:24-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:34:24):**  Well, I was invited in by Permaculture America Latina to teach a course there and my administrator  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:34:32):**  didn't make it in because he didn't get his visa and was never allowed into Guatemala.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:34:38):**  So I was stuck with a young Australian translator and I had to pull it off myself.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:34:42):**  And it was a difficult block of land because it flooded.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:34:46):**  It was the Exe Army camp during the conflict as the barrier section going into San Lucas  
**[0:34:58-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:34:58):**  Tolley Man.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:00):**  But we put four swales through the system.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:04):**  I designed it up.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:05):**  I taught a PDC, a Permaculture Design Certificate course.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:09):**  I explained the benefit of swales to reduce the flooding and sink the water into the ground.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:16):**  And I put in more perennial systems as an example.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:20):**  We actually didn't do a lot of coffee in that zone.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:23):**  It was more diverse than that because it was right in town, really just on the edge of  
**[0:35:29-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:29):**  town.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:30):**  We actually linked into the abattoir next door and got quite a lot of manure in the  
**[0:35:34-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:34):**  top swale.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:35):**  The next year I came back almost exactly a year later and they finished off the refined  
**[0:35:42-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:42):**  design earthworks.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:43):**  And I immediately woke up in the morning in a repurposed grain silo, which was an ex-aid  
**[0:35:53-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:53):**  project.  
**[0:35:54-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:54):**  I mean, the whole project was surrounded by failed aid projects going back to the 50s,  
**[0:36:00-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:00):**  which is quite normal if anybody's worked in aid.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:03):**  There's just endless aid infrastructure fading away.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:08):**  And I woke up in this, I'd come in at night and I woke up with this quite good view from  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:15):**  this grain silo that had been turned into a two-story accommodation.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:20):**  Fitted out with silky oak, what you call gravileia there, gravilia robusta, which is an Australian  
**[0:36:27-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:27):**  tree endemic to where we are talking to right now.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:30):**  And nobody knew that you could use it for timber.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:34):**  It had been cut for a high pollard over the coffee as a shade coffee and only I think  
**[0:36:39-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:39):**  the plantation owners were taking the high quality timber.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:43):**  But I told everybody that.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:46):**  So I was in this beautiful, fitted out two-story accommodation and I looked out the window  
**[0:36:51-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:51):**  and immediately I thought, I don't need to be here.  
**[0:36:56-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:56):**  They already know exactly what I'm doing.  
**[0:36:57-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:57):**  Isn't that a nice feeling, ironically?  
**[0:36:59-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:59):**  It was wonderful.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:00):**  I mean, I walked out on my own.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:02):**  I can remember it quite distinctly.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:04):**  I got stung by a bee as well, right in between my thumb and my forefinger as I put my hand  
**[0:37:09-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:09):**  in my pocket.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:10):**  It must have been on the rim of my hip pocket.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:12):**  It kind of gave me a little bit of sting symbiosis, I thought.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:15):**  That's quite a bit of Guatemala I'm not going to easily get.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:19):**  And it didn't worry me.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:20):**  And I'm walking around thinking, I really don't have to be here.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:22):**  These guys have really, really got it.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:24):**  I mean, they've just totally got it.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:27):**  And I knew Ronaldo would be totally connected to the Cachacil people.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:35):**  And his ambition was to get it out to all the five Mesoamerican countries and all the  
**[0:37:42-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:42):**  main indigenous people.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:43):**  But the thing is that many things have happened since then in the world of permaculture.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:49):**  We were interviewing Eric Tonesmeyer just the other day, who co-wrote the book with  
**[0:37:54-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:54):**  Dave Jackie, Forest Gardening.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:56):**  And he's done some incredible work and he's published more work.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:38:01):**  He is literally one of the great permaculture mavins.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:38:04):**  He's now a Yale lecturer on agroforestry, food forestry.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:38:12):**  He said that he now has proof that when you take a monoculture like palm oil or coffee  
**[0:38:18-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:38:18):**  or cacao into a polyculture, you actually increase the production of the original monoculture.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:38:26):**  And you get the additional polycultural yields.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:38:29):**  So this is now becoming things that have been well researched and are now proven.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:38:36):**  So there's absolutely no reason not to make that conversion over all of these lands and  
**[0:38:43-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:38:43):**  get out of this crazy monocultural situation because it's not as productive.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:38:48):**  It's obviously not as stable.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:38:51):**  Now that gives you extra yield, but it also gives you time to do things traditionally  
**[0:38:57-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:38:57):**  back at your home base.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:38:59):**  Because if you look at permaculture two, actually, is it permaculture one or permaculture two,  
**[0:39:07-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:07):**  the original books that Bill wrote, the first garden that Bill honors is a traditional Guatemalan  
**[0:39:15-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:15):**  home garden and all its polyculture elements.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:18):**  So it's actually in the tradition of Guatemala.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:23):**  Now just to finish this little story off, the testament after that second visit, not  
**[0:39:29-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:29):**  long after, I was still in touch.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:31):**  I haven't needed to be in touch because if I wanted to come to Guatemala and see the  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:36):**  guys at IMAP, it would be for me to learn about permaculture in Guatemala, not for me  
**[0:39:41-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:41):**  to teach them.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:42):**  That's for sure.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:43):**  They'd know more about permaculture in Guatemala than I'll ever know.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:46):**  I'm just a rough mainframe designer who's spread all over the world, basically lighting  
**[0:39:54-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:54):**  fires in people's minds and activities.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:57):**  But after that second visit, next year you had Hurricane Mitch.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:02):**  And Hurricane Mitch came in over the Gulf of Mexico, out of the Caribbean, and sat right  
**[0:40:09-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:09):**  on top of Guatemala and dumped about eight meters of rain right down on that region.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:14):**  And I'm thinking, wow, what the hell happened?  
**[0:40:18-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:18):**  So I got in touch.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:19):**  It was kind of early internet days.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:21):**  I got in touch and I said, what happened?  
**[0:40:23-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:23):**  What happened?  
**[0:40:24-0:40:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:24):**  How did it handle it?  
**[0:40:26-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:26):**  And it starts just amazing.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:27):**  It handled it perfect.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:29):**  Yes, we got it flooded, but it handled the flood.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:32):**  And we harvested about 30 meters of high quality soil, which is now raised this further out  
**[0:40:38-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:38):**  of the flood because we just pulled that out of the swell trenches and spread it over the  
**[0:40:43-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:43):**  land and we're getting higher every time one of those things wants to dump on us.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:47):**  And it was that easy.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:49):**  The biggest problem that happened, land slips, devastation everywhere.  
**[0:40:54-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:54):**  And our site got a benefit.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:57):**  And that's recently happened last year here where we had Cyclone Debbie hit us here, we're  
**[0:41:02-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:02):**  nowhere near that amount of rain, but we had massive floods here.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:05):**  I recently made a video about it.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:07):**  And our landscape, it fell apart, but we actually had nothing.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:12):**  We gained soil.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:13):**  So this is, you know, talk about turn the problem into the solution.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:18):**  It's literally there in action.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:19):**  We need to make, you know, you need to make films about these things and make it blatantly  
**[0:41:24-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:24):**  obvious in high def and cartoons and every other way you can transfer information.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:30):**  So you know, because people believe screens more than they believe reality.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:34):**  You can walk people around the real landscape and a lot of them just literally cannot see  
**[0:41:38-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:38):**  it.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:39):**  And they will see it on screen and then they'll go to learn how to see it because it is it  
**[0:41:45-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:45):**  is a change in the way you see the world.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:47):**  It literally is literally with your eyes.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:49):**  It's a way you use your literally use your eyes.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:52):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:53):**  Those types of examples are really inspiring.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:56):**  And we've had a lot of cases like that here in our valley as well with designs that we've  
**[0:42:00-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:00):**  done ourselves and that some of our clients have run with on their own.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:03):**  Those big weather events which previously were big erosive forces and were damaging  
**[0:42:09-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:09):**  the land when certain, you know, almost chiropractic adjustments are made to handle that type of  
**[0:42:15-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:15):**  a hit, absorb the nutrients.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:18):**  And especially for the fact that so many of the surrounding properties are not managed  
**[0:42:21-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:21):**  the same way.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:23):**  Their loss is the gain for these properties that have implemented these systems and shifted  
**[0:42:29-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:29):**  towards a more resilient way of dealing with large weather events, which, you know, as  
**[0:42:33-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:33):**  we all know, are becoming much more frequent as well.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:36):**  So a time for change and implementation of these is very urgent.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:40):**  Yeah, I couldn't agree more.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:42):**  So now you mentioned earlier, you know, now that they've become established and have really  
**[0:42:47-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:47):**  run with some of the initial ideas that you helped to propagate in this area as far as  
**[0:42:52-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:52):**  permaculture design, you also mentioned that you're somewhat of a mainframe operator and  
**[0:42:57-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:57):**  your main job is to sort of instill inspiration and light a fire in the places that you go.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:43:03):**  But within that, there are still some general broad strokes that can be made in most regions  
**[0:43:09-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:43:09):**  in order to help make a transition and create resilience in the landscape.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:43:14):**  Could you talk about some of those broad strokes and Sam, maybe some of your own observations  
**[0:43:19-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:43:19):**  as you're learning as well that apply to a lot of regions and are generally true across  
**[0:43:25-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:43:25):**  differences in climate and geography?  
**[0:43:27-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:43:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:43:28):**  Well, for me, it's water, access and structures.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:43:37):**  Water is such a crucial element for life, obviously, and it behaves in quite a few constant  
**[0:43:48-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:43:48):**  ways and when anything in this universe acts in a constant way, then it becomes a secure  
**[0:44:00-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:44:00):**  element to design.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:44:02):**  So water acts in quite a few ways with evaporation, cooling the air and condensation warming the  
**[0:44:11-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:44:11):**  air and water sitting perfectly level and not moving uphill for free, but flowing out  
**[0:44:16-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:44:16):**  on contour, soaking in and only traveling at right angle to contour through the landscape,  
**[0:44:22-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:44:22):**  even when it's moving so slowly underground.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:44:27):**  Those ways of designing water so it's pacified, taking the longest path over the most distance,  
**[0:44:33-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:44:33):**  moving as slowly as possible with as much passive friction as you can achieve, rubbing  
**[0:44:38-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:44:38):**  up against as many beneficial living elements as possible is a sort of approach to water.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:44:45):**  Picking up as much hardware as possible where water runs off 100% runoff surfaces and pass  
**[0:44:53-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:44:53):**  upon it and spreading it and soaking it.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:44:55):**  So what Brad Lancaster in Tucson, Arizona calls planting the rain, planting the runoff  
**[0:45:01-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:45:01):**  or even planting surplus irrigation and then offering those options.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:45:07):**  Now then those patterns are reasonably constant because the landscape itself is a continuum  
**[0:45:12-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:45:12):**  of forms shaped by the cosmic forces millennia of meteorological events, weather events.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:45:21):**  So then your access has to compromise with that, has to cooperate with that, has to run  
**[0:45:27-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:45:27):**  in harmony with it and your access can be a benefit to the water itself.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:45:35):**  But it has costs in different cultures, in different worlds, it has different costs and  
**[0:45:41-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:45:41):**  it comes in different forms and a lot of places in the developed world it definitely involves  
**[0:45:46-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:45:46):**  motor vehicles.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:45:48):**  And then there are minor access branchways that all can be designed to harmonize with  
**[0:45:55-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:45:55):**  water and cooperate with the water design.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:45:58):**  And then it becomes very obvious where your infrastructure options are.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:46:02):**  Now those infrastructure itself has to be well designed in relation to both climate  
**[0:46:09-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:46:09):**  and landscape.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:46:13):**  Good infrastructure works well with climate and the landscape that you're working in.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:46:19):**  And then you've got a pretty good mainframe.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:46:21):**  Now obviously the next thing is who's your client and what is their requirements and  
**[0:46:29-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:46:29):**  you may have to find out what's their budget, what's their time frame, what's their availability  
**[0:46:37-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:46:37):**  of involvement and what's their experience.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:46:46):**  And you've got a basic mainframe.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:46:49):**  Wherever you're talking about it, size of land obviously comes into play as well there.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:46:55):**  But whether you're talking about a client in different countries or a community in different  
**[0:47:00-0:47:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:47:00):**  countries or a government in different countries or a corporation in different countries, whatever  
**[0:47:06-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:47:06):**  they're trying to design, whatever their ambitions are, that's kind of a mainframe approach.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:47:14):**  Doesn't matter whether you're building a city or a giant new industrial economic zone or  
**[0:47:20-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:47:20):**  whatever it is.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:47:23):**  Something that recurringly comes up in permaculture that I can't see as ever being something that  
**[0:47:30-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:47:30):**  could leave, because I think it's the most revolutionary part of permaculture way of  
**[0:47:35-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:47:35):**  thinking is pattern recognition.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:47:39):**  Recognizing these water patterns.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:47:41):**  Jeff talks about patterns being the glue in permaculture because you can see how patterns  
**[0:47:47-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:47:47):**  going across all disciplines, all ways of thinking, how the patterns really influence  
**[0:47:54-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:47:54):**  your relationship not only to nature but to the land that you're designing, to life and  
**[0:47:59-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:47:59):**  everything in general.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:48:01):**  So as we cultivate a greater understanding of what patterns are, whether that's weather  
**[0:48:06-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:48:06):**  patterns, whether that's patterns in the soil or whatever else, then these things are things  
**[0:48:15-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:48:15):**  that we can foster, they're the constants.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:48:18):**  And they're the continuous things that help us do.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:48:23):**  I'm glad to hear those answers from both of you and we reflect a lot of these priorities  
**[0:48:28-0:48:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:48:28):**  as well in the design criteria checklist that we recently published.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:48:31):**  So if anybody wants to take a look at those, I'll put the link to that in the show notes  
**[0:48:35-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:48:35):**  for this episode.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:48:37):**  Now going back and taking maybe a little bit more of a specific look at the parallels between  
**[0:48:43-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:48:43):**  our similar ecosystems here for us in the highlands in Guatemala and you in your kind  
**[0:48:49-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:48:49):**  of central coastal region of Australia.  
**[0:48:53-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:48:53):**  We are here in the high, sorry, we're here in the high elevation subtropics in sort of  
**[0:49:01-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:01):**  a wet dry climate.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:02):**  We're currently in the wet portion right now and we're getting a lot of rain this time  
**[0:49:06-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:06):**  of year.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:08):**  Obviously there are quite significant differences in geological formations and details within  
**[0:49:15-0:49:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:15):**  the climactic system.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:17):**  Jeff, have you seen many other climates like this with very successful polyculture systems  
**[0:49:25-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:25):**  and perennial systems that have found a lot of success within these parameters?  
**[0:49:30-0:49:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:30):**  Oh yeah.  
**[0:49:32-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:32):**  Your climate analog that I remember, I think is you're eight degrees north of the equator  
**[0:49:39-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:39):**  and 2,000 meters above sea level.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:42):**  And you'd be about 200 kilometers from the Pacific Ocean.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:47):**  Yep.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:48):**  Pretty, pretty similar situations almost exactly to that of EMAP.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:52):**  Yeah, that's what I'm quite something like that.  
**[0:49:54-0:50:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:54):**  And if you drive from San Lucas, Tolyman downhill towards the west in 15 minutes, you're in  
**[0:50:02-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:02):**  the tropics.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:03):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:04):**  It descends in elevation very quickly.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:07):**  Because you're so high, 2,000 meters, you're in the subtropics, but you have a tropical  
**[0:50:12-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:12):**  day length.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:13):**  So you don't have an extended winter, you don't have an extended summer or shortened  
**[0:50:21-0:50:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:21):**  winter day length.  
**[0:50:22-0:50:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:22):**  So the sun, you have a tropical sun angle, but you have a temperature range, which is  
**[0:50:31-0:50:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:31):**  subtropics because of altitude, because every 100 meters is one meter of latitude.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:39):**  That's a nice climate.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:41):**  And if you keep going up, you've got temperate climate crops that will grow, but they won't  
**[0:50:45-0:50:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:45):**  flower because the day length doesn't change.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:48):**  So that's always something you've got to take into consideration.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:52):**  That has been one of the challenges.  
**[0:50:53-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:53):**  Yeah, we were growing a lot of things that do well in various other climates, but because  
**[0:50:57-0:51:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:57):**  of the shorter days and the lack of frost, a lot of these things don't end up going out  
**[0:51:03-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:03):**  to seed or maturing in the same way.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:05):**  So it's fashion crop, which is well known on the television, which has turned our consuming  
**[0:51:13-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:13):**  global population into a generic expectation of what they eat.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:23):**  When you look at some of the things that Eric Tozmaier is researching, it goes right out  
**[0:51:28-0:51:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:28):**  to edible willow leaves that grow on the edge of the Arctic Circle, on the edge of the tree  
**[0:51:35-0:51:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:35):**  line.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:36):**  And you probably find there's hundreds of perennial crops that nobody eats that are  
**[0:51:40-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:40):**  possible to grow right where you are that don't worry at all about day length.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:45):**  But no one would want to buy them because they don't know what they are.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:49):**  And there's a whole education process that creates an identity for your region, which  
**[0:51:54-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:54):**  is unique.  
**[0:51:55-0:51:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:55):**  And that's what makes things sell, really, is having the unique story and stop going  
**[0:51:59-0:52:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:59):**  for the generic identity.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:06):**  I mean, we don't want to all be generic humans because there is such wonderful, diverse potential.  
**[0:52:15-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:15):**  And you are in a classic volcanic country.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:18):**  I think it's four volcanoes around Lake Atilan.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:21):**  And if you were paying attention, the Volcan Fuego just went off and there was a major  
**[0:52:26-0:52:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:26):**  international disaster here for quite a while.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:30):**  I always remember digging in the soil and looking at some of the crops and thinking,  
**[0:52:35-0:52:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:35):**  why aren't strawberries growing so well?  
**[0:52:39-0:52:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:39):**  This is all indicating you've got lots of rainfall.  
**[0:52:42-0:52:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:42):**  You've got rich, beautiful, rich, deep soil.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:46):**  Everything looks like it's humid and acid.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:48):**  Why is it indicating alkalinity?  
**[0:52:50-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:50):**  And kind of scratching my head as I looked up in the air and thought, there's a smoking  
**[0:52:54-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:54):**  volcano.  
**[0:52:55-0:52:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:55):**  There's another one.  
**[0:52:56-0:52:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:56):**  There's another.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:57):**  And I'm like, hold on a minute, of course, it's volcanic ash.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:00):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:01):**  It's alkaline.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:02):**  And why didn't I think that it was alkaline?  
**[0:53:05-0:53:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:05):**  How stupid am I?  
**[0:53:06-0:53:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:06):**  I mean, you know, these are the lessons that never leave you.  
**[0:53:10-0:53:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:10):**  And I never, never, never assume a pH scale until I'm absolutely sure.  
**[0:53:16-0:53:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:17):**  There's such unique factors here, exactly like you mentioned.  
**[0:53:20-0:53:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:20):**  You can have swamps and deserts that are acid and deserts are oceans of alkalinity, but  
**[0:53:25-0:53:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:25):**  there can be an island of acidity in a swamp.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:29):**  And there are swamps and deserts.  
**[0:53:32-0:53:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:32):**  There are famous swamps and deserts.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:33):**  And here you have a climate that's obviously mostly acid, but with so much volcanisms,  
**[0:53:40-0:53:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:40):**  recent volcanisms, it's all volcanic ash.  
**[0:53:43-0:53:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:43):**  So you've got to start adapting to that.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:47):**  And you can.  
**[0:53:48-0:53:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:48):**  It's fine.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:49):**  But you've just got to have those clues and become aware of it.  
**[0:53:56-0:54:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:56):**  We're at latitude 28 here, south of the equator.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:00):**  We're 45 kilometers from the Pacific Ocean.  
**[0:54:05-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:05):**  And we're only 20 meters above sea level at the bottom of the property.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:08):**  And we're 83 at the top of the property.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:10):**  So there are things we would share in crops, but there are things that we definitely don't  
**[0:54:16-0:54:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:16):**  share.  
**[0:54:17-0:54:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:17):**  And that's a fantastic thing because I really loved what you mentioned.  
**[0:54:20-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:20):**  One of the things that we focus on with our demonstration site here is, yeah, it's tragic  
**[0:54:26-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:26):**  how homogenized the global food system has become.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:29):**  And Guatemala, with its very resilient ecosystem because of the rainfall that we get and the  
**[0:54:34-0:54:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:34):**  health of the soils in a lot of places where they haven't been damaged, has been producing  
**[0:54:39-0:54:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:39):**  so many of these foods that are all for export value.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:43):**  Going from low quality potatoes, broccolis, tomatoes and such, which are not indigenous  
**[0:54:49-0:54:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:49):**  to here, but there's a global market for.  
**[0:54:51-0:54:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:51):**  So people are growing and as a result, severely degrading their soils.  
**[0:54:56-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:56):**  We're trying to promote not only heritage breeds of things that have market value, but  
**[0:55:01-0:55:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:55:01):**  also bringing back to sort of, it hasn't really fallen out of respect, but back to some of  
**[0:55:08-0:55:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:55:08):**  the prominence of the heritage and indigenous species that are endemic to the traditional  
**[0:55:15-0:55:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:55:15):**  diet of this area and showing that there's a whole variety of plants that may not be  
**[0:55:21-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:55:21):**  very well understood in Western diets, but that grow really well here, oftentimes are  
**[0:55:26-0:55:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:55:26):**  perennial, very, very high producing, extremely nutritious and absolutely delicious.  
**[0:55:32-0:55:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:55:32):**  And it's just a matter of education to get those back into prominence and popularity.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:55:38):**  So that we can start growing things here again that do well, need less maintenance and rebuild  
**[0:55:43-0:55:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:55:43):**  the soil in the ecosystem.  
**[0:55:45-0:55:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:55:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:55:46):**  And there'd be a lot of global indigenous plants that are from the similar analogs that  
**[0:55:51-0:55:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:55:51):**  do well there, too.  
**[0:55:53-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:55:53):**  So doing a climate analog for your zone would probably link you to places like New Guinea,  
**[0:56:01-0:56:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:56:01):**  which would have similar altitudes at similar latitudes or some parts of the South Pacific  
**[0:56:07-0:56:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:56:07):**  would have similar analogs.  
**[0:56:12-0:56:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:56:12):**  These are all interesting things to compare.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:56:17):**  And rather than introduce non-natives that are not suited, introduce non-natives that  
**[0:56:25-0:56:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:56:25):**  are from the same analogs, which will be just as stable as the endemic and increase the  
**[0:56:33-0:56:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:56:33):**  diversity beyond what it's ever been before.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:56:36):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:56:37):**  And I mean, we can go back into the geopolitical history of this region, which I've been studying  
**[0:56:40-0:56:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:56:40):**  up on a little bit more recently.  
**[0:56:42-0:56:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:56:42):**  And it's absolutely fascinating how this became a major coffee producing country when coffee  
**[0:56:48-0:56:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:56:48):**  is originally from Ethiopia and Eastern Africa.  
**[0:56:52-0:57:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:56:52):**  And the indigenous crop here, the heritage versions of cacao are much less prominent  
**[0:57:00-0:57:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:00):**  in the production of Guatemala, but obviously have moved over, especially in Western Africa,  
**[0:57:05-0:57:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:05):**  to being one of the higher producing areas around the world.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:09):**  And just how, you know, colonization and global trade has caused that switch to me is fascinating.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:17):**  And working within sort of how both of these regions are developing and re-establishing  
**[0:57:22-0:57:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:22):**  some of the native crops has been a big inspiration of mine lately.  
**[0:57:25-0:57:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:26):**  And gourmet coffee now is averaging some very, very high prices if you go in that direction,  
**[0:57:33-0:57:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:33):**  too.  
**[0:57:34-0:57:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:35-0:57:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:35):**  And you know, there's 602 American dollars for a pound of unprocessed coffee was the  
**[0:57:40-0:57:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:40):**  world record just set last year.  
**[0:57:42-0:57:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:42):**  And where's that coming from?  
**[0:57:44-0:57:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:44):**  That's out of Colombia, I think.  
**[0:57:46-0:57:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:46):**  And there are Colombian produced small producers averaging $250 a pound unroasted because of  
**[0:57:56-0:57:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:56):**  the level and quality.  
**[0:57:58-0:58:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:58):**  And food forest coffee is refreshing some of the highest.  
**[0:58:00-0:58:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:58:00):**  It's always diverse coffee production.  
**[0:58:03-0:58:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:58:03):**  These are small producers, just like in Guatemala.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:58:06):**  But for the real gourmet market, organic, of course, extremely diverse production, and  
**[0:58:16-0:58:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:58:16):**  particular cultivars, and particular potential ways of initial process, but not roasted.  
**[0:58:24-0:58:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:58:24):**  So I've been working with people in Colombia, students of mine on this, who have been trying  
**[0:58:29-0:58:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:58:29):**  to help Colombian producers to gain a better price for their product.  
**[0:58:36-0:58:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:58:36):**  And they've done pretty well.  
**[0:58:38-0:58:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:58:38):**  Yeah, it's remarkable how some of these major commodity plants around the world work so  
**[0:58:43-0:58:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:58:43):**  extremely well in agroforestry and polyculture systems, as they're integrated in with other  
**[0:58:49-0:58:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:58:49):**  species that sort of co-evolved with them, help to build soil and act towards the health  
**[0:58:55-0:58:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:58:55):**  of all of the species within the system.  
**[0:58:59-0:59:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:58:59):**  That's been one of our real initiatives that we are trying to push around here, especially  
**[0:59:04-0:59:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:59:04):**  in partnership with the Mesoamerican Institute of Permaculture, like you mentioned, and Atitlan  
**[0:59:09-0:59:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:59:09):**  Organics, and helping to constantly observe, which obviously is one of the main traits  
**[0:59:15-0:59:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:59:15):**  for a good designer, and seeing which of these interactive companion planting systems interact  
**[0:59:22-0:59:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:59:22):**  well within the micro differences and the micro climates, even just being on the other  
**[0:59:28-0:59:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:59:28):**  side of the lake from IMAP, there are a lot of differences in our soils, there are differences  
**[0:59:34-0:59:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:59:34):**  in the way that the sun touches the land throughout the day, and those can actually foster or  
**[0:59:40-0:59:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:59:40):**  inhibit the relationships between some of the polycultures that each one of us are working  
**[0:59:45-0:59:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:59:45):**  on.  
**[0:59:46-0:59:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:59:46):**  Especially with your steep slopes.  
**[0:59:48-0:59:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:59:48):**  Yeah, and extremely rocky soil where we're at too.  
**[0:59:51-0:59:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:59:51):**  So we haven't focused so much on large cash crops because we're doing a very biointensive  
**[0:59:55-1:00:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:59:55):**  method on a half acre, and we're working with, especially goats right now, and one of the  
**[1:00:02-1:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:02):**  major economic outputs or enterprises from our farm at the moment is milk, yogurt, and  
**[1:00:09-1:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:09):**  cheese, which we all make from the goats that go around and graze freely around the landscape  
**[1:00:14-1:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:14):**  here in the mountains, and they do extremely well in this climate, and with the terrain  
**[1:00:18-1:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:18):**  that we have, whereas other ruminants and different animals that maybe were brought  
**[1:00:23-1:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:23):**  from a different environment struggle with as well.  
**[1:00:26-1:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:26):**  So now, going on to sort of explore some of the other challenges and the limitations of  
**[1:00:33-1:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:33):**  moving forward, where have you both found the most success when it comes to inspiring  
**[1:00:38-1:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:38):**  real change in the communities?  
**[1:00:40-1:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:40):**  Is it things like food sovereignty, debt-free housing, I know Sam you've worked a lot with  
**[1:00:45-1:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:45):**  sustainable housing, perhaps reconnecting with nature, or is it something else?  
**[1:00:51-1:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:51):**  I think it's something tangible.  
**[1:00:53-1:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:53):**  I think it's something real.  
**[1:00:55-1:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:55):**  I think it's something different to the norm and something that affects people directly,  
**[1:00:59-1:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:59):**  which is why diversity of approaches is so important, because we're a diverse world of  
**[1:01:03-1:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:01:03):**  people.  
**[1:01:05-1:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:01:05):**  I think things that connect people together, a fantastic thing is Transition Towns.  
**[1:01:13-1:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:01:13):**  They're doing a lot of work and they've found that the thing that's of most benefit to people  
**[1:01:20-1:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:01:20):**  is actually, or that people have most praise for in what they've done, is that they know  
**[1:01:27-1:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:01:27):**  each other, that they know their neighbors.  
**[1:01:31-1:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:01:31):**  The sorts of things that touch people at a heart level can, for a farmer, be realizing  
**[1:01:39-1:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:01:39):**  and recognizing the state of their land and that there's a situation where they don't  
**[1:01:45-1:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:01:45):**  have to be in debt.  
**[1:01:47-1:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:01:47):**  Reading stories about farmer suicides, these sorts of things can be the wake up that some  
**[1:01:51-1:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:01:51):**  people need, because they can see it happening so close to home.  
**[1:01:58-1:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:01:58):**  I think it's always movements made by real people.  
**[1:02:02-1:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:02:02):**  It's always movements made by people that know the problem and are affected by the problem  
**[1:02:09-1:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:02:09):**  themselves.  
**[1:02:14-1:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:02:14):**  We call it grassroots movements, but grass can be ripped out of the ground.  
**[1:02:18-1:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:02:18):**  I think they should be called mycelial movements because it's about connection.  
**[1:02:24-1:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:02:24):**  It's actually these movements are what support the big trees in the first place.  
**[1:02:28-1:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:02:28):**  Then government doesn't exist.  
**[1:02:30-1:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:02:30):**  These big trees of government don't exist without the mycelium that supports it.  
**[1:02:35-1:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:02:35):**  We are that mycelium and without it, everything dies.  
**[1:02:43-1:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:02:43):**  It's these movements that affect real people because they're made by real people, because  
**[1:02:48-1:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:02:48):**  they give us insight into the things that different people are doing.  
**[1:02:54-1:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:02:54):**  That inspires change and that inspires more people to realize that they can do, that it's  
**[1:03:00-1:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:03:00):**  not actually some higher up, it's not some out of power.  
**[1:03:04-1:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:03:04):**  It's actually someone doing something right next door to them that they can be involved  
**[1:03:08-1:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:03:08):**  in.  
**[1:03:09-1:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:03:09):**  And how about you, Jeff?  
**[1:03:10-1:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:03:10):**  I know the concepts and the ideas that you found are really the ones that stick, especially  
**[1:03:15-1:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:03:15):**  in your international work, maybe transcending cultural or historical backgrounds.  
**[1:03:21-1:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:03:21):**  What are the things that really hold on and take root in those communities?  
**[1:03:27-1:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:03:27):**  Health has always been a big thing that's driven people's desire to be involved.  
**[1:03:36-1:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:03:36):**  It's never really gone away from the early days and it's still very much there.  
**[1:03:44-1:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:03:44):**  People wanting better health and being worried about their health and seeing more evidence  
**[1:03:49-1:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:03:49):**  that things aren't going well as far as modern lifestyles.  
**[1:03:56-1:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:03:56):**  Now we have so much more evidence about nutrient density from having well-balanced and rich  
**[1:04:05-1:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:04:05):**  soil ecosystems and gut ecosystems.  
**[1:04:08-1:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:04:08):**  There are so many links we're finding more and more between the soil ecosystem and the  
**[1:04:16-1:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:04:16):**  ecosystem within our digestion, within our guts.  
**[1:04:21-1:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:04:21):**  The parallels are remarkable.  
**[1:04:22-1:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:04:22):**  From anaerobic in the stomach all the way to aerobic in the colon and ferments and naturally  
**[1:04:32-1:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:04:32):**  processed, preserved food, whether it's brine, ferments, brine preserves or different types  
**[1:04:42-1:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:04:42):**  of processes and fermentations or lactations and all the different forms, we're now finding  
**[1:04:50-1:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:04:50):**  there are inoculums of health boosting situations.  
**[1:04:56-1:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:04:56):**  This all links to herbalism as well, which has always been there, but it's just been  
**[1:05:02-1:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:05:02):**  chugging along underneath it all or along with it.  
**[1:05:06-1:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:05:06):**  We're involved in all of that and we're helping people with these things.  
**[1:05:10-1:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:05:10):**  Obviously, there's the peak oil, the power, the potential Armageddon scenario and everything  
**[1:05:17-1:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:05:17):**  else that people are afraid of, but the one that really does anchor is your personal health,  
**[1:05:24-1:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:05:24):**  the way the health of your friends affect you and the health of your family affects  
**[1:05:28-1:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:05:28):**  you.  
**[1:05:30-1:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:05:30):**  When people realize they don't just get healthy but they get vital, they start to function.  
**[1:05:38-1:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:05:38):**  Their energy levels go up.  
**[1:05:41-1:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:05:41):**  This is something that is on the rise again.  
**[1:05:45-1:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:05:45):**  The evidence is there.  
**[1:05:47-1:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:05:47):**  It's on the rise again.  
**[1:05:50-1:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:05:50):**  Even in developing countries where there hasn't been such an awareness of health and it hasn't  
**[1:05:58-1:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:05:58):**  been the same people have been connected to traditional diets as those diets have changed,  
**[1:06:03-1:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:06:03):**  but the information ages has come in at the same time.  
**[1:06:08-1:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:06:08):**  People are fast-tracking into health consciousness.  
**[1:06:10-1:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:06:10):**  A story for the Hope of Health is a recent design that you got given to do.  
**[1:06:18-1:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:06:18):**  Do you want to say?  
**[1:06:20-1:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:06:20):**  One of my students from the last online course or a few online courses back is high up in  
**[1:06:27-1:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:06:27):**  Southwest Queensland Health and Hospital Department has asked me to consult for the Department  
**[1:06:37-1:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:06:37):**  of Health.  
**[1:06:39-1:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:06:39):**  This is a large area of Southwest Queensland.  
**[1:06:41-1:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:06:41):**  It's hard to imagine, but it's probably not far off, not much smaller than the area that  
**[1:06:48-1:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:06:48):**  is the size of Guatemala.  
**[1:06:51-1:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:06:51):**  Hasn't got a large population, but it has a large agricultural population and towns  
**[1:06:56-1:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:06:56):**  that are well spread apart.  
**[1:06:58-1:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:06:58):**  They've realized that permaculture is a system that they could use to make their health department  
**[1:07:09-1:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:09):**  efficient and concentrate on wellness to preempt illness because they just can't afford the  
**[1:07:16-1:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:16):**  infrastructure to be put in position for these people that are spread over remote areas of  
**[1:07:23-1:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:23):**  Southwest Queensland.  
**[1:07:24-1:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:24):**  This is not physical design.  
**[1:07:26-1:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:26):**  This is organizational design using permaculture principles.  
**[1:07:31-1:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:31):**  That's something very hopeful.  
**[1:07:33-1:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:33):**  That's something very exciting and something quite unique for me.  
**[1:07:37-1:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:37):**  I've got plenty of people in my team that can help me on those sort of community consultation  
**[1:07:42-1:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:42):**  processes.  
**[1:07:45-1:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:45):**  That's people thinking a completely different way about using permaculture design to create  
**[1:07:50-1:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:50):**  a better scenario from what at present is a failing government funded situation.  
**[1:07:57-1:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:57):**  Certainly.  
**[1:07:58-1:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:58):**  Yeah.  
**[1:07:59-1:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:59):**  And like you said, so many of these connections come out of when you start with the fundamental  
**[1:08:05-1:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:05):**  education of recognizing patterns in nature, learning to work with energy flows and sort  
**[1:08:12-1:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:12):**  of build resilience and fertility within the landscape.  
**[1:08:15-1:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:15):**  And as you mentioned to the way the micro sort of follows the macro, the internal environment  
**[1:08:22-1:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:22):**  of the human body has so many similarities with that of the external world.  
**[1:08:27-1:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:27):**  And once you get an education in these fundamentals, then it's kind of you've opened up Pandora's  
**[1:08:33-1:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:33):**  box and it's just a matter of learning the intricacies within the techniques that can  
**[1:08:38-1:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:38):**  really take these things into a higher level of functioning, whether it's food production  
**[1:08:43-1:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:43):**  and like you said, fermentation and different methods of preserving or whether you go into  
**[1:08:49-1:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:49):**  the health aspect.  
**[1:08:50-1:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:50):**  They're all really well connected.  
**[1:08:52-1:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:52):**  And within that concept, before I let you guys go, can you let all of our listeners  
**[1:08:57-1:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:57):**  know how they can best contact you?  
**[1:08:59-1:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:59):**  And Jeff, if you'd like to talk a little bit about some of your educational opportunities  
**[1:09:03-1:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:03):**  coming up as well.  
**[1:09:04-1:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:04):**  Yeah.  
**[1:09:05-1:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:05):**  I'd just like to say, if I may, just to finish off there, when I go into an area, I actually  
**[1:09:13-1:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:13):**  look at the health records of people.  
**[1:09:15-1:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:15):**  I want to know what they're dying of.  
**[1:09:17-1:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:17):**  I want to know what their sicknesses are.  
**[1:09:22-1:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:22):**  And I want to know how long they live.  
**[1:09:25-1:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:25):**  So this area, Southwest Queensland, where I'm going to be doing this design for the  
**[1:09:29-1:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:29):**  health department, people live five to 10 years.  
**[1:09:32-1:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:32):**  They die five to 10 years younger than they do in the cities of Australia and the Aboriginal  
**[1:09:37-1:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:37):**  community 10 to 15 years younger.  
**[1:09:41-1:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:41):**  And there's a reason for that.  
**[1:09:42-1:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:42):**  And you look at the health records and there it is.  
**[1:09:44-1:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:44):**  So when you go into areas for aid, if you look at the health records, we are the guinea  
**[1:09:49-1:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:49):**  pigs.  
**[1:09:50-1:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:50):**  We can see, you can see what the morbidity figures are, what the health records are.  
**[1:09:55-1:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:55):**  So these are things we can study.  
**[1:09:58-1:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:58):**  And what people are starting to realize is that your body doesn't just absorb insoluble  
**[1:10:05-1:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:05):**  food.  
**[1:10:06-1:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:06):**  It's transferred through the organisms in your gut if it's real food.  
**[1:10:10-1:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:10):**  Now you can take refined foods in like soluble fertilizer is soaked in through the roots  
**[1:10:18-1:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:18):**  of plants because they have to drink.  
**[1:10:21-1:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:21):**  You are forced, I mean, you can't help but absorb such processed foods.  
**[1:10:26-1:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:26):**  And this is where obesity comes from.  
**[1:10:29-1:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:29):**  And now it's becoming very, very obvious that healthy gut organisms are the ones that do  
**[1:10:33-1:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:33):**  the transactions.  
**[1:10:35-1:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:35):**  And we have to keep them alive like it's an internal ecosystem.  
**[1:10:40-1:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:40):**  So it is important for your listeners to realize this.  
**[1:10:43-1:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:43):**  I mean, it's not rocket science.  
**[1:10:46-1:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:46):**  It's not simple, though.  
**[1:10:47-1:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:47):**  And it's an interesting complexity that you can really benefit from starting to develop  
**[1:10:54-1:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:54):**  an understanding for.  
**[1:10:55-1:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:55):**  So I'm sure I'd speak for Sam here as well.  
**[1:10:59-1:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:59):**  Our main concern is creating healthy people so we can all create a healthy planet.  
**[1:11:08-1:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:11:08):**  My educational components that I'm very much involved in right now is JeffLawtonOnline.com.  
**[1:11:16-1:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:11:16):**  It's my main website.  
**[1:11:17-1:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:11:17):**  Everything is folding in underneath that.  
**[1:11:19-1:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:11:19):**  My Jeff Lawton public figure Facebook page.  
**[1:11:26-1:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:11:26):**  JeffLawtonOnline.com has lots of free videos.  
**[1:11:33-1:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:11:33):**  I also have what's called a Friday 5, which you can link to on JeffLawtonOnline.com, which  
**[1:11:39-1:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:11:39):**  is I send out a newsletter with five interesting points and keep people up to date with books  
**[1:11:46-1:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:11:46):**  I'm reading, things I'm interested in, comments I want to make about the world.  
**[1:11:53-1:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:11:53):**  Some beautiful, some not so great.

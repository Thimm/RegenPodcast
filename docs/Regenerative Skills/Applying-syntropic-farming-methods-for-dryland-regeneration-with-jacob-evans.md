### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 31 Jul 2020 06:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:00:09):**  You're in the right place for all things regenerative living, ecological restoration,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:00:14):**  permaculture and natural building.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:00:16):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:00:18):**  In this show, it's my job to interview leaders, innovators and rebels on the cutting edge  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:00:22):**  of their fields as we look for solutions to our generation's most urgent challenges  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:00:27):**  and share these techniques and information so that you can join us in creating a healthy  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:00:31):**  and abundant world for everyone.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:00:33):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:00:41):**  Without a doubt, the most important mission of our lifetimes will be regenerating this  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:00:44):**  planet and creating a new culture based on care and stewardship for all life.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:00:49):**  But it can be hard to know where to start.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:00:52):**  After more than 150 episodes of speaking to leaders and innovators in the regenerative  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:00:57):**  fields around the world, and working with clients and organizations to help them reach  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:01:01):**  their regenerative goals, I've compiled many lists of essential skills and steps that  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:01:05):**  anyone can take today to begin their journey towards a brighter future for themselves,  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:01:10):**  their families and communities, and for the ecosystems that support them.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:01:14):**  Every two weeks, I'll send you a new regenerative skill that you can develop and expand on in  
**[0:01:19-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:01:19):**  your own life right away.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:01:20):**  What's more is that I'm creating a community of skill builders like you who are sharing  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:01:25):**  their results and stories of success to inspire you towards greater action.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:01:29):**  You can sign up right now in the show notes for this episode or on the homepage at AbundantEdge.com.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:01:35):**  Start your week off right by building your skills for a regenerative future.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:01:41):**  Over the years now, I've been hearing about a new pedagogy of land management that's  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:01:45):**  been gaining in popularity, especially in agroforestry circles.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:01:49):**  The trouble for me has been that until recently, a lot of the resources have been in Portuguese,  
**[0:01:53-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:01:53):**  and so I kept my eye on it from a distance.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:01:56):**  But syntropic farming is a term first coined by Ernst Gotch, a Swiss farmer who immigrated  
**[0:02:01-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:02:01):**  to Brazil in the 1980s and pioneered a new form of farmland management on his land in  
**[0:02:07-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:02:07):**  Bahia.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:02:08):**  But today, to speak about the principles of syntropic farming and how he's adapted them  
**[0:02:12-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:02:12):**  to the unique Mediterranean climate of the southern region of Spain, known as Andalusia,  
**[0:02:18-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:02:18):**  I spoke with a good friend of mine, Jacob Evans.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:02:20):**  Now, Jacob has been working for four years now at the Surya Lila Yoga Retreat Center  
**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:02:26):**  as their permaculture farm manager.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:02:27):**  Now, in that time, he's helped to establish some impressive agroforestry and food production  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:02:31):**  systems with limited resources in a region that's best known for the rapid desertification  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:02:37):**  and extremes of hot, dry summers and frigid winters.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:02:41):**  There the 20 hectare property stands in contrast to the denuded plains around them, and it's  
**[0:02:46-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:02:46):**  beginning to change the hearts and minds of people who think that there's little that  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:02:49):**  can be done to reverse the damage done to the land there.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:02:53):**  In this interview, we talk about what syntropic farming is and what it represents, and Jacob  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:02:57):**  also walks me through some of the ways that he's applied its principles in his context  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:03:01):**  in Andalusia and how the trials have been working out for the last four years.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:03:05):**  We also go over some of the specific plants and methods that have been successful for  
**[0:03:09-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:03:09):**  him there and a lot more.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:03:10):**  Now, I was actually able to meet Jacob a little after this interview in person, actually just  
**[0:03:15-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:03:15):**  the other week when he came up to Barcelona for a trip and we got to hang out a little  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:03:19):**  bit to talk about our projects and the ambitions that we both have here in Spain.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:03:24):**  We also did a little fermented food and seed swap from our respective gardens, and I'm  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:03:28):**  really looking forward to further collaborating with Jacob since he's already been in great  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:03:32):**  contact for me to get to know this new country and this region by sharing plant lists and  
**[0:03:37-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:03:37):**  advice from his experience.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:03:40):**  I'm also really looking forward to getting in touch with other innovators and practitioners  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:03:43):**  of syntropic farming, especially here in Spain or in the Mediterranean region.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:03:48):**  So if any of you out there know of someone who fits that description, please pass their  
**[0:03:51-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:03:51):**  contact to me or share the episode with them.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:03:54):**  And now with that out of the way, I'll hand things over to Jacob.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:03:57):**  Hey Jacob, thanks for making the time to be with me today.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:04:01):**  I know you and I have actually been talking a lot in the last couple of weeks, but how's  
**[0:04:05-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:04:05):**  it going over there?  
**[0:04:06-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:04:06):**  It's going really well.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:04:07):**  We've had a very kind spring.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:04:10):**  It's still super green and now the summer dry season is coming in.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:04:13):**  As you know, we're in a Mediterranean climate, similar to what you're in, maybe a little  
**[0:04:18-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:04:18):**  bit hotter, maybe a little bit colder in the winter.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:04:21):**  So now I think it won't be raining here until mid-October, but in general, I'm doing really  
**[0:04:27-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:04:27):**  good and it's great to be here on the podcast.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:04:30):**  Yeah, well look, so for the audience and everybody who hasn't been talking to you for a while,  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:04:36):**  why don't you talk a little bit about your background and how an Englishman came to be  
**[0:04:41-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:04:41):**  working on a yoga retreat center in Andalusia and managing a syntropic farm.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:04:48):**  Cool.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:04:49):**  So I'm Jacob Evans.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:04:51):**  I'm 29 years old.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:04:53):**  I left the UK, I'm from England.  
**[0:04:56-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:04:56):**  I left there when I was 19.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:04:59):**  At first I spent a few summers working in bars and tourism.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:05:02):**  I spent a couple of years working on super yachts a world away from syntropic farms and  
**[0:05:07-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:05:07):**  yoga and permaculture.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:05:10):**  And then about six years ago, I quit that job and I went for a travel around South America  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:05:15):**  to do the woofing and volunteering and having experiences.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:05:20):**  And it came to a time where I needed to come back to Europe.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:05:22):**  And as I'd lived in Spain before, I ended up coming back to Spain to manage the farm  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:05:29):**  out of a yoga retreat center.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:05:32):**  So there's the yoga retreat center business, which is called Surialila, which is a Sanskrit  
**[0:05:37-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:05:37):**  word, which means playing with the cosmic sun.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:05:40):**  And there's the not for profit permaculture farm, which is called Danyadhara, which means  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:05:48):**  blessed earth in Sanskrit, the yogic language.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:05:52):**  And it's good to have the for profit and not for profit because we can use the leverage  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:05:57):**  both of those businesses give us so we can accept donations, but we can also use the  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:06:03):**  for profit business as well.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:06:05):**  It's a very nice marriage, the two interdependent.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:06:10):**  So when I was in South America, I came to a point where I have to come back to Europe  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:06:14):**  and I need to find somewhere and I like Spain and I got in touch with the farm here and  
**[0:06:19-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:06:19):**  they had a permaculture consultant come and look at the land, which is 20 hectares or  
**[0:06:26-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:06:26):**  50 acres.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:06:27):**  And they said, you look, you need someone there full time to really manage this land.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:06:31):**  And that person became me.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:06:32):**  So I've been there now four years.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:06:36):**  And it's been great.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:06:37):**  And every day is a school day and learning things all the time.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:06:41):**  Well, so tell me a little bit about your day to day sort of routines on a farm, given that  
**[0:06:48-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:06:48):**  I assume the land was very degraded when you came into the picture, because I've seen your  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:06:54):**  little tour of the place the other day that you had live on a Zoom stream.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:07:00):**  It looks fantastic, but it's very easy to see what the terrain looks like outside of  
**[0:07:04-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:07:04):**  the landscape as well.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:07:05):**  And I would imagine that's pretty similar to what you started with.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:07:08):**  Yeah, oh yeah, we were working in what I would call concrete, concrete soils, very bare.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:07:14):**  I mean, here, culturally, it's normal to leave bare soil and degrade the soil with the plow  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:07:19):**  and the chemicals.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:07:21):**  So I started with 20 hectares and seven hectares of that was semi abandoned olive grove.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:07:28):**  There were six hectares that was wheat, sunflower, subsidy, chemical farming, and the rest of  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:07:34):**  it was kind of just semi abandoned.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:07:40):**  And since then, four years ago, I've been installing greywater systems.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:07:44):**  As it's a yoga retreat center, there's guests most of the year.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:07:48):**  I mean, now with COVID and things, it's been very quiet, but normally there's 50, 60 guests  
**[0:07:54-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:07:54):**  there.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:07:55):**  So greywater showers, greywater washing machines, vegetable garden, and a more bigger reforestation  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:08:04):**  edible landscaping project, as well as regenerating the olive grove.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:08:09):**  So there's a lot of different aspects to the farm.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:08:11):**  Plus we have some animals and there's a whole, the owner, the director, she's very vegetarian.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:08:17):**  I would have animals for me and create a business out of that similar to Richard Perkins style,  
**[0:08:23-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:08:23):**  if you're familiar with him.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:08:24):**  But I've got to deal with the context.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:08:26):**  So the context is you have very degraded land and the project is more towards fighting desertification  
**[0:08:33-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:08:33):**  because that's a big thing in the region.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:08:35):**  Although we were supposed to get 600 millimeters of rain per year, which is the same as London,  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:08:40):**  that comes in about over four months.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:08:44):**  It usually comes October, November and March and April.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:08:48):**  And when the soil has been plowed and plowed and plowed, it's not going to accept that  
**[0:08:52-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:08:52):**  rain.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:08:53):**  It's just going to run off and cause huge erosion.  
**[0:08:54-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:08:54):**  So over the last years, I've been, I mean, I planted over 15,000 trees in shrubs and  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:09:01):**  then I've got ground cover and animal rotation, basically just ecosystem services happening.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:09:07):**  And the day to day, we run courses as well and we run volunteers.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:09:12):**  So it's pretty hectic.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:09:13):**  Actually right now it's quite chill compared to how it has been.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:09:15):**  But there's been times where I've had 12 volunteers and I mean, it's a double edged sword because  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:09:20):**  you have the free labor, inverted commas, but then you have the people that are there  
**[0:09:26-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:09:26):**  just kind of for a holiday and want to be spoon fed and don't want to learn.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:09:29):**  So say if I've got 10 volunteers, maybe three or four of them are really good workers and  
**[0:09:34-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:09:34):**  a few of them are not.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:09:36):**  And it's, if I've only got four volunteers, maybe two of them are really good workers.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:09:39):**  So it's always like that.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:09:42):**  There's always that pattern.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:09:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:09:44):**  I mean, that's definitely been my experience when we had volunteers on the farm back in  
**[0:09:46-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:09:46):**  Guatemala.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:09:47):**  It's like the, it seems like it's a fantastic thing to have all of that free labor, but  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:09:52):**  if it's difficult to manage and some people need a whole lot more management than others  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:09:58):**  who either have some experience, have worked on farms or just, they know how to get on  
**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:10:03):**  with it.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:10:04):**  And if you're unable to kind of keep track of the ones who need their hands held, which  
**[0:10:09-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:10:09):**  no problem, it was really great to accept those people.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:10:12):**  A lot of them were fantastic, but you just have to be around for it.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:10:16):**  If you don't have the manpower, the resources to look after them, it can actually end up  
**[0:10:20-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:10:20):**  being a huge drain.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:10:22):**  Totally, totally.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:10:23):**  And for me, it's been a big learning curve to just focus on the positive and the people  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:10:28):**  that really want to be there and learn and make the most out of it rather than trying  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:10:32):**  to chase after people that are not that bothered.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:10:36):**  It's been a big learning curve and that's what the owner of the business has liked as  
**[0:10:41-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:10:41):**  well to have lots of people.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:10:42):**  But for me, I would have maybe put a limit on it.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:10:45):**  And I do get a lot of creative freedom with the land, but I am limited to the, I mean,  
**[0:10:49-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:10:49):**  in the agrarians, the climate of the mind of the owner.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:10:52):**  So it's a huge learning curve.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:10:57):**  And then now the summer is coming in, we're working sort of 7am till 2pm.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:11:04):**  Whereas in the winter, we can work 10am until 6pm without any problem with that because  
**[0:11:09-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:11:09):**  it's so hot, it's better to just work early morning.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:11:12):**  Sure, well, that's where you get the famous siesta aspect of the culture from that region.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:11:19):**  Yeah, and I did used to work in the evenings when I lived on site, but now I've got a child  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:11:24):**  and family, so I try not to go back to work in the evenings.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:11:29):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:11:31):**  Well, so look, so I was originally put in touch with you by a mutual friend of ours,  
**[0:11:36-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:11:36):**  Mark, who also lives in the UK.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:11:37):**  And I've been in good touch with him as he's working now for a no dig market garden and  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:11:44):**  has shared a lot of cool resources and feedback.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:11:47):**  So shout out to Mark.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:11:49):**  But so I first got in touch with you because I was looking to get more information from  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:11:55):**  sort of the local climate and plant lists and what works in this area from people who  
**[0:12:00-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:12:00):**  have some experience.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:12:01):**  And I was really excited when I learned that a lot of what you are implementing on that  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:12:07):**  site has to do with centropic farming methodologies.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:12:12):**  And I mean, I've been researching everything from permaculture to regenerative ag and,  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:12:17):**  you know, everything in between all the different methods from lasagna gardening and, you know,  
**[0:12:21-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:12:21):**  deep mulch bedding or, you know, there's so many little branded techniques out there.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:12:27):**  But centropic farming was one of the ones that I struggled to get a good definition  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:12:31):**  on, partly because so many of the resources are in Portuguese since it kind of was developed  
**[0:12:35-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:12:35):**  and came out of Brazil.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:12:37):**  But your understanding and the resources that you put me or that you gave out to me to do  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:12:43):**  some more learning really opened up my eyes to what this, I guess, management technique  
**[0:12:49-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:12:49):**  really is.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:12:50):**  But for those people who aren't familiar with it, can you give us maybe a little overview  
**[0:12:54-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:12:54):**  of your understanding of centropic farming?  
**[0:12:58-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:12:58):**  From my understanding of centropic farming is it's constituted by a theoretical and practical  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:13:04):**  setting in which the natural processes are translated into farming interventions in their  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:13:10):**  form, functions and dynamic.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:13:12):**  Thus, we can talk about regeneration by use.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:13:17):**  Since the establishment of highly productive agriculture areas, which tend to be independent  
**[0:13:22-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:13:22):**  of inputs and irrigation, results in the provision of ecosystem services with special emphasis  
**[0:13:29-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:13:29):**  on soil formation, regulation of microclimate and the favouring of water cycles.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:13:35):**  That way, agriculture is synced with the regeneration of ecosystems.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:13:42):**  So I would go on to describe that as creating abundant systems.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:13:47):**  There is no recipe with centropic farming.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:13:49):**  It's a lot of observation and understanding patterns.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:13:53):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:13:55):**  And one of the things that I was excited about as I started to learn more through you and  
**[0:13:58-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:13:58):**  the resources you sent was that it's a fantastic way of looking especially at forestry systems  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:14:05):**  because a lot of the techniques were sort of developed around the tropical forest conditions  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:14:10):**  on the Atlantic rainforest in Brazil.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:14:15):**  And it's a way of, you know, certainly turning a yield from a farming perspective, but also  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:14:19):**  really accelerating the succession of plants and the growth that they can go through by  
**[0:14:25-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:14:25):**  understanding how different signals from maintenance like pruning or harvesting or amendments to  
**[0:14:33-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:14:33):**  the soil or polyculture plantings send signals to these plants to either go into a vegetative  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:14:40):**  state to grow taller, to die back.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:14:43):**  And you can play with these different sequences in order to accelerate the growth and the,  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:14:49):**  I guess, the restoration of damaged landscapes so that it would take much less time than  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:14:55):**  perhaps if even if you were to just leave it to its own devices.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:14:59):**  Completely.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:15:00):**  I mean, we can, if by understanding the patterns of nature, whichever climate we're in, obviously,  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:15:05):**  if you're in the tropics, it's going to be way quicker.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:15:07):**  You're going to get trees growing four or five meters in a year, the pine trees.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:15:14):**  But by understanding the principles, you can apply that in any climate and you can be getting  
**[0:15:18-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:15:18):**  a yield within a couple of months and then another yield in another few months and you're  
**[0:15:24-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:15:24):**  getting yields throughout the whole life of the system.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:15:26):**  And instead of weeding, you're actually harvesting.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:15:30):**  So you can do syntropic farming with high production annual crops to get yields.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:15:38):**  But the idea is you create in a forest and you plant in whole forests when you start  
**[0:15:44-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:15:44):**  the syntropic farming.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:15:45):**  So little example for here in the Mediterranean region where I'm doing regeneration.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:15:51):**  This is not for profit, but this is direct for kitchen.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:15:54):**  So it's all about context as well.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:15:57):**  So I'm on degraded soil, I might plant succulent plants like yuca, like agave, some ground  
**[0:16:03-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:16:03):**  cover succulents.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:16:05):**  All grow really well from cuttings.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:16:07):**  I'll put in some oak seeds, some almond seeds, some sage, some rosemary, some artichoke,  
**[0:16:16-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:16:16):**  fava beans, lettuce.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:16:19):**  And so in say three months, I'll be getting three to four months, I'll be getting fava  
**[0:16:23-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:16:23):**  beans out of that system.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:16:25):**  And instead of letting that fava bean plant completely mature and produce seed, then it  
**[0:16:31-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:16:31):**  will go into entropy if I let it go past its strongest point.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:16:35):**  So I harvest some beans and then I cut that fava bean and I leave the roots in the ground  
**[0:16:40-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:16:40):**  and I put the biomass on the ground.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:16:43):**  And then so instead of going and weeding the island or the syntropic bed, I've gone and  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:16:52):**  harvested and fertilized and that pruning sends messages to the other plants saying  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:16:56):**  you grow baby grow.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:17:00):**  Same with the lettuce, then maybe the artichoke will be ready at the end of that year or in  
**[0:17:04-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:17:04):**  two years.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:17:05):**  And that will come back each year for a few years.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:17:09):**  So they say there's the placenta one and the placenta two.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:17:12):**  The placenta one annual plants that give a quick yield.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:17:17):**  And in my context with degraded soils and lack of moisture, I choose things like low  
**[0:17:22-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:17:22):**  feeders as you would say, like lettuce, fava beans, things that I'm not going to have to  
**[0:17:27-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:17:27):**  do much with.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:17:28):**  I'm not going to have to give much manure to things like that.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:17:31):**  And then the artichokes established in the Rosemary and Thyme and Lavender's established  
**[0:17:37-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:17:37):**  and then in two to three years I can be harvesting that.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:17:39):**  Say we've got sage, I can make smudge sticks with it and sell that to the yoga people out  
**[0:17:44-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:17:44):**  of our shop.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:17:47):**  All the while the space is being held by the succulent plants with the succulent plants  
**[0:17:51-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:17:51):**  so breaking the wind.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:17:54):**  They don't need any extra water.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:17:55):**  They're harvesting dew from the nighttime.  
**[0:17:57-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:17:57):**  Imagine a yucca plant or an agave plant.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:17:59):**  It's like an upside down umbrella.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:18:01):**  So that's actually bringing in the dew and dropping that dew down.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:18:05):**  While there's an almond tree from seed and a mulberry tree and an oak tree.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:18:11):**  So the almond tree is like the secondary forest which is around for maybe 50 years with the  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:18:18):**  oak tree being around for maybe 300 to 500 years.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:18:23):**  And throughout the life of that system, I might add some nitrogen fixing shrubs as well,  
**[0:18:27-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:18:27):**  throughout the life of that system things are being pruned.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:18:29):**  So it's all about space, stratification to be harmonized over the time of the life cycle.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:18:36):**  So the beans that grow really quickly and then they come out and then say the Rosemary  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:18:40):**  and the Attachokes, they're filling that space and then they get pruned and then the almonds  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:18:45):**  are coming up and maybe you prune the oak tree back to the ground for 50 to 70 years  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:18:51):**  while those roots are going deeper and deeper and the almonds are having a life of maybe  
**[0:18:55-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:18:55):**  50 to 70 years.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:18:57):**  And then when you take the almond out the oak tree is ready to go and take over.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:19:02):**  So you've got the successional steps of the centre, the secondary and the climax.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:19:10):**  And you're always moving forward towards an abundant system.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:19:13):**  So first you've got the colonisation with the annuals and the placenta, then you've  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:19:17):**  got accumulation with the secondary and then you've got abundance with the climax.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:19:22):**  And throughout the life of that system you're harvesting something.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:19:25):**  So it's not like, I often get asked around here, why do you plant things so close together  
**[0:19:30-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:19:30):**  by the locals who are totally bewildered?  
**[0:19:32-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:19:32):**  And it's like, that's how nature works.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:19:34):**  That's how an ecosystem works.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:19:36):**  Nature doesn't want to be just a vegetable garden or annual crop field or a monocrop  
**[0:19:41-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:19:41):**  of whatever.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:19:44):**  It's going to fight against it.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:19:45):**  So if you understand how nature moves forward in succession, you can plant with plants that  
**[0:19:52-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:19:52):**  are going to give us yields and work together and understand that and bring it forward through  
**[0:19:59-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:19:59):**  management and work with nature rather than against it as permaculture has said for a  
**[0:20:05-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:20:05):**  long time.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:20:06):**  Sure, sure.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:20:07):**  Yeah, I mean, this seems to solve the problem that I have asked on so many interviews in  
**[0:20:13-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:20:13):**  the past.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:20:14):**  It's like, yeah, we all recognize that getting these longer term mature perennial systems  
**[0:20:20-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:20:20):**  is really what's worth working towards in most ecosystems.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:20:24):**  There's few examples where you're not trying to move towards forest and, you know, respecting  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:20:29):**  savannah land and natural grasslands is among those.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:20:33):**  But in a lot of cases, you're trying to establish a mature forest as sort of the apex of abundance  
**[0:20:38-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:20:38):**  in wherever you're working.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:20:41):**  And that's all well and good to say.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:20:43):**  But if it takes 30 years to get a yield from that, nobody is going to have the upfront  
**[0:20:49-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:20:49):**  capital to work on this.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:20:51):**  But these these successional models really start right from the beginning with, you know,  
**[0:20:56-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:20:56):**  building annual plants that play a role in, I guess, accelerating the maturation and the  
**[0:21:05-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:21:05):**  biodiversity that's going to later turn into the mature system that you're working towards.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:21:10):**  And in every step along the way, there's something to be taken as a yield that can sustain you  
**[0:21:16-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:21:16):**  financially and also have a lot of returns for the ecosystem that you're building towards.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:21:22):**  Completely.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:21:23):**  And you can adapt it to your context.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:21:26):**  I'm in a very extreme context with water scare wells dry out.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:21:32):**  And our context is more land regeneration of the long term.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:21:36):**  But if you wanted short term yields and you have water and access to manure between your  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:21:41):**  sort of tree beds, I mean, your tree beds, you still have annuals, but you can leave  
**[0:21:46-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:21:46):**  space between and plant fast growing vegetables in beds between that eventually going to get  
**[0:21:52-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:21:52):**  phased out once that kind of closes.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:21:55):**  But you can, you know, you can be growing your chilies, your aubergines, your lettuce,  
**[0:22:00-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:22:00):**  whatever.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:22:01):**  And as you grow in that and adding fertility and irrigating that, that's all going towards  
**[0:22:06-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:22:06):**  the future forest.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:22:07):**  So I kind of see it as money in the current account for now money in the checking account  
**[0:22:12-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:22:12):**  for now and you put in money in your savings account for later.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:22:16):**  So yeah, that's a good analogy.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:22:18):**  In 10-15 years time, you're not relying on those annual yields, you're going to be moving  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:22:23):**  to a perennial system that can also have animals in it because you can also space out these  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:22:28):**  tree lines if you're on a larger property, you can space them out and run animals through  
**[0:22:32-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:22:32):**  whether that's chickens or cows or mixed species grazing, you can create savannas or forests,  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:22:39):**  you can choose it to your context and you're stacking enterprises.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:22:45):**  Now I've seen through the tour that you did just the other week, or actually just a couple  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:22:49):**  of days ago, that you have a mix where you've done rows of forest plantings like you just  
**[0:22:54-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:22:54):**  talked about, but you also have sort of these little island clusters.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:22:58):**  Can you talk about how these two techniques kind of differ and what they have in common?  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:23:04):**  So yeah, in certain contexts it makes sense to do straight lines or contour lines or key  
**[0:23:09-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:23:09):**  lines and plan it that way.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:23:11):**  So you can either graze animals in between the lines or use a machine, a mower or tractor  
**[0:23:17-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:23:17):**  to mow in between.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:23:20):**  Or if you've got smaller spaces, say a home garden or like us with the yoga center, because  
**[0:23:25-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:23:25):**  I'm also doing landscaping for a yoga center but for an edible landscape that has, say  
**[0:23:32-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:23:32):**  like, the owner, she planted a few pines five years ago in some really, really poor soil.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:23:39):**  And they're already a bit scattered around.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:23:41):**  So I took these pines and planted what we call islands around them or donuts.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:23:45):**  The pines might not even be there later, but right now they're providing a bit of shade  
**[0:23:48-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:23:48):**  and a bit of reference.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:23:49):**  So I would plan accordingly.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:23:54):**  I would look at my sun angles.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:23:56):**  Where is the sun coming from?  
**[0:23:57-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:23:57):**  What am I going to plant on the south and west sides to protect from the sun?  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:24:00):**  So in my Mediterranean context, that's going to be succulents like agave that are going  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:24:04):**  to face that to the west or south.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:24:09):**  Then on the north, I'm going to plant more shade loving species.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:24:12):**  This is all around a pine as an example.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:24:17):**  On the south, I might plant a mulberry because that's deciduous.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:24:20):**  On the north, I might put a madrona or strawberry tree, which is evergreen.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:24:24):**  So the mulberry is going to shade that in the summer.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:24:27):**  But the madrona fruits in December when the mulberry has lost its leaves, so the whole  
**[0:24:32-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:24:32):**  light is going to be coming through.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:24:35):**  And basically filling any gaps because if we don't plant things, nature will come and  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:24:40):**  put weeds for us, which weeds are just plants doing a job.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:24:45):**  They're filling the niches.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:24:46):**  So if we don't fill that space, then nature will come and do it.  
**[0:24:49-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:24:49):**  So I find if you've got space, fill it up and observe what grows around well.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:25:00):**  So the islands are great.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:25:02):**  You always get a mix of the placenta species, the annuals.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:25:06):**  So you've got your annual placentas up to a year, then your placenta 2, which is up  
**[0:25:11-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:25:11):**  to 10 years, your secondary forest, which is 20 to 60 years, and then your climax, which  
**[0:25:18-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:25:18):**  is for hundreds of years.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:25:20):**  So you're always planting everything together as one organism.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:25:24):**  And then you're pruning as you need to prune because that's what makes things go so quickly.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:25:29):**  The pruning just speeds everything up.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:25:33):**  And with these islands, in my context, I will put straw around them because I'm in a region  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:25:39):**  where they grow a lot of wheat and I can pick up literally a truck, a camion, as I say,  
**[0:25:43-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:25:43):**  of wheat straw from the year before that's a bit damp for 50 euros, which is nothing,  
**[0:25:50-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:25:50):**  and get 400 bales of straw.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:25:54):**  And so I'll put a donut around the straw, which will protect the soil.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:25:59):**  That will give a bit of wind protection, a bit of shade, and that'll get things going.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:26:04):**  So this is all my context.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:26:06):**  And then I'll, in other situations, I'm doing the lines where I'll put, say, on the Southwest  
**[0:26:12-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:26:12):**  side here, I'll put rosemary, lavender, sage, oregano, Mediterranean herbs, which are going  
**[0:26:18-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:26:18):**  to protect that soil from the afternoon sun.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:26:21):**  It's going to create a shade.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:26:23):**  And they're like placenta 2, they're species that are going to be in for maybe 5, 10, 15  
**[0:26:27-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:26:27):**  years.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:26:28):**  And in the middle of this rose, I'll put a retimer, an artichoke.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:26:32):**  Retimer's like a wispy looking shrub that gets to 3 meters.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:26:35):**  It's a native nitrogen fixer.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:26:37):**  So I'll put retimer and wild artichoke, which gives artichokes to eat.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:26:42):**  And also you can eat the leaves.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:26:45):**  And then on the backside, the sort of north side of the beds, as I say, I put trees and  
**[0:26:50-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:26:50):**  lots of, in our context, almonds, mulberries, oaks, pine nuts, strawberry tree, which are  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:26:59):**  all different strata's because we're looking to, oh carob as well, it's an important one.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:27:04):**  We're looking to fill up the different strata's.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:27:07):**  So you've got your understory, your medium story, your higher tree.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:27:10):**  So by what Ernst Gurch, the founder of Centropic Agriculture said, or the guy who made it popular,  
**[0:27:17-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:27:17):**  is that to get one tree, productive tree, you want to plant a hundred seeds.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:27:21):**  So I'm either planting loads and loads of seeds and lots of, lots of plants and then  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:27:28):**  thinning out because ultimately the thinning, the pruning gives more energy to the system.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:27:33):**  And if you don't occupy that space, then something else will.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:27:37):**  And by having the choice, by planting a lot, it gives you the choice to keep the most vigorous,  
**[0:27:43-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:27:43):**  the most species.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:27:46):**  So I'm very much a fan of getting lots and lots of seeds from the local area and plants  
**[0:27:51-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:27:51):**  and planting it very, very densely and seeing what goes well.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:27:55):**  And you always end up with the best specimens that way because ultimately you do loose things  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:28:00):**  as well.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:28:01):**  See, I love this technique of, like you said, really manipulating the placement of the plants  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:28:07):**  so that you utilize their properties and what they're good at, you know, for their placement  
**[0:28:12-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:28:12):**  and their spacing for the advantage of the whole group.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:28:16):**  But it really takes a fairly intimate knowledge of the plants that you have access to in order  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:28:20):**  to be able to do this effectively.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:28:23):**  And you've been doing this for four years, but you know, I just got here not even a full  
**[0:28:28-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:28:28):**  year ago and haven't quite had access to the land and the forest around here.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:28:34):**  What do you recommend for someone to really start to understand the variety of plants  
**[0:28:39-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:28:39):**  available to them in their area between natives, between imports, and especially since so much  
**[0:28:46-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:28:46):**  of what you mentioned aren't commonly grown for economic value on any of the farms or  
**[0:28:52-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:28:52):**  cultivated intentionally in a lot of places.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:28:55):**  Where did you start to build this understanding and knowledge?  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:28:59):**  I think because I'm on this degraded land as well, I've had to adapt to that.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:29:04):**  Really, I mean, I had a challenge from kind of the owner of the property director, and  
**[0:29:09-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:29:09):**  it was basically get this field planted in a key line pattern.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:29:15):**  The big field that I talked about that was with wheat and sunflowers for many years.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:29:20):**  To plant on a key line pattern, we plant 5000 trees and it was a case of, we're going to  
**[0:29:24-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:29:24):**  plant 5000 trees, I better choose the ones that I see growing around here without any  
**[0:29:30-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:29:30):**  irrigation because we don't have the resources.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:29:33):**  So that kind of woke me up to, okay, what is growing around here without any water that  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:29:40):**  when you abandon agricultural land or by the side of the roads, it does really well.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:29:45):**  So that got me in touch with the local plants because, I mean, the owner, she's got lovely  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:29:52):**  intentions, but she had the idea of an avocado farm when we started out.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:29:57):**  I had to explain to her, look, it's not possible.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:30:00):**  Avocados are not going to grow well in our biome, but there are plenty of things that  
**[0:30:03-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:30:03):**  are going to grow well.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:30:05):**  So that drove me to find what was going to grow well.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:30:09):**  And literally looking by the side of the road and abandoned fields, you can see what's growing  
**[0:30:14-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:30:14):**  well.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:30:15):**  I mean, you look a bit further, people's gardens and orchards and are they irrigating, are  
**[0:30:20-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:30:20):**  they not?  
**[0:30:21-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:30:21):**  And you soon find out what plants and species are doing well in your area through observation.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:30:28):**  So just literally walking around and looking at what's growing teaches you a lot.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:30:34):**  Yeah, I mean, that's been huge for me too.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:30:36):**  And even before Mark put us in touch, I had been making this sort of large plant database  
**[0:30:42-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:30:42):**  of what I was finding around here.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:30:44):**  And it's still kind of one of my favorite pastimes is to go on walks around here, especially  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:30:48):**  in the trails and the wooded areas away from where things are being actively managed and  
**[0:30:54-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:30:54):**  see what's doing well.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:30:55):**  In fact, I did a vuelta with my girlfriend and her father the other day.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:30:59):**  And it's incredible the amount of food just growing everywhere around here.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:31:05):**  And I don't know if it's just because there's been such a constant presence on the Iberian  
**[0:31:09-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:31:09):**  peninsula for over a thousand years now, or just because so many food crops do so well  
**[0:31:16-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:31:16):**  here natively, like even just the small cirowellas, the plums.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:31:22):**  And I was finding those trees all over the place and a lot of things that haven't started  
**[0:31:26-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:31:26):**  to mature yet, but the Mediterranean is so full of food.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:31:32):**  It really is.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:31:35):**  It's so full of options.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:31:36):**  Yeah, the Mediterranean has just been so well managed really during the past, go back 200  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:31:42):**  years and it was people were completely self-sufficient because they had to be.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:31:46):**  I mean, the region where I am, Andalusia, it really only opened up to industrial tractor  
**[0:31:52-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:31:52):**  farming methods 50 years ago.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:31:54):**  I speak to where I'm based.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:31:57):**  I'm on the edge of, I'm on a ridge and there's one side you can see flat industrial farmland,  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:32:03):**  wheat, sunflowers, and melons and the plastic.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:32:07):**  And then the other side we've got national park and there's green hilltops and things.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:32:11):**  So it's the contrast.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:32:15):**  I forgot where I was going with that.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:32:21):**  But yeah, just the abundance of this region and the climate.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:32:25):**  No, like you were saying, it's very recent that destructive agricultural practices have  
**[0:32:30-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:32:30):**  become common in this area.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:32:33):**  And it's tragic because it is, as abundant as it is, it's a fairly brittle climate and  
**[0:32:39-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:32:39):**  mismanagement can lead to sort of a cascade of negative environmental impact where now  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:32:46):**  if we were to leave it alone, it wouldn't necessarily grow back, at least not for a  
**[0:32:51-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:32:51):**  long time.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:32:52):**  It would take a long time for mature systems to reestablish.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:32:57):**  And I see this plant called Alta Vaca, which is a shrub which grows in compacted degraded  
**[0:33:04-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:33:04):**  soils.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:33:05):**  And most farmers would see it as a complete weed and they'd be like, what chemicals are  
**[0:33:09-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:33:09):**  spraying this to get rid of it?  
**[0:33:10-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:33:10):**  But what I noticed with the Alta Vaca, firstly, it grows in the summer, it's green in the  
**[0:33:13-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:33:13):**  summer and it's brown in the winter.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:33:17):**  And we get very, very hot summers.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:33:19):**  But some of the older ones, they start growing wild olives and wild pistachios by themselves  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:33:25):**  in the middle of the Alta Vaca plants.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:33:28):**  So the nature knows, if we were to come and prune these Alta Vaca plants, then the wild  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:33:34):**  olive would then grow quicker and the wild pistachio would grow quicker, the carob that  
**[0:33:39-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:33:39):**  start growing and they will grow quicker because the birds come and seed things.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:33:42):**  So you start to get this mosaic and nature prepares itself.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:33:45):**  But yeah, if you do not prune it and manage it, it's going to take a lot longer.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:33:50):**  Whereas if you understand natural succession and you come and prune those plants that are  
**[0:33:55-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:33:55):**  doing the kind of protecting, holding the space like the Alta Vaca, like the Retima,  
**[0:34:01-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:34:01):**  then you can speed things up exponentially.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:34:04):**  Whereas if you leave a Retima plant, it'll get three meters tall, three meters wide,  
**[0:34:08-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:34:08):**  become really woody.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:34:09):**  And it will become like a lockout in succession.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:34:13):**  Whereas you prune that, then succession comes on very quickly.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:34:19):**  Nature wants to move forward, but it can get stuck, especially in these drier, more brittle  
**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:34:23):**  climates where decomposition doesn't happen for many months.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:34:28):**  What I've found is here, by just putting organic matter down year after year for a few years,  
**[0:34:35-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:34:35):**  it's still coming back to the grass, like for the yoga center to make it pretty in inverted  
**[0:34:42-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:34:42):**  commas, like we have to keep mowing.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:34:44):**  And it just keeps coming back even now, like the neighbors ain't coming back now.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:34:47):**  It's dry.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:34:48):**  But here, because we've put down organic matter, it just keeps coming back to the grass.  
**[0:34:53-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:34:53):**  And even in summer, actually, it looks green whenever it's just brown.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:35:00):**  But there's this cultural thing of scrape it off, burn it, get rid of it, and stop things  
**[0:35:05-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:35:05):**  moving forward.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:35:06):**  But once you start moving things forward and understand how nature works, it does the work  
**[0:35:12-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:35:12):**  for you.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:35:13):**  You just have to do a few little interventions.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:35:16):**  When it invites you to be a participant in the process rather than an antagonist that's  
**[0:35:21-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:35:21):**  always fighting against it moving forward, when you realize that, all right, fine, maybe  
**[0:35:25-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:35:25):**  it's not what I had in mind for my personal idea of aesthetics or what our culture tells  
**[0:35:31-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:35:31):**  us is beautiful as a way of maintaining this, and open up to what I can find for my personal  
**[0:35:38-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:35:38):**  benefit within how this wants to be on its own, and learning how to accelerate the natural  
**[0:35:46-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:35:46):**  process and then finding your benefits in it rather than forcing your will onto it and  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:35:52):**  allowing a few things to advance on their own, it really changes the paradigm.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:35:57):**  And it also really reduces the amount of work you have to do sometimes, depending on how  
**[0:36:02-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:36:02):**  big of a yield you're trying to pull.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:36:05):**  Totally, totally.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:36:08):**  And I mean, what I've been realizing the last year is there's so many indirect yields, like  
**[0:36:13-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:36:13):**  from all these things I've been planting, like succulent plants that don't give a direct  
**[0:36:18-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:36:18):**  yield per se, but they're harvesting the rain, the moisture from the night, the dew, but  
**[0:36:23-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:36:23):**  also they, right now I'm harvesting tons and tons of snails every day now, I'm clearing  
**[0:36:29-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:36:29):**  because of the dry herbaceous layer, and then I'm harvesting tons and tons of snails that  
**[0:36:33-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:36:33):**  have come as a result of my planting.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:36:35):**  And those snails are a really, really high quality food source, which most people wouldn't  
**[0:36:39-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:36:39):**  even think about because culturally in most places you don't eat snails.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:36:42):**  Here it's common in Spain and France.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:36:45):**  I'm thinking, actually, I've planted these snails because in the areas around where it's  
**[0:36:50-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:36:50):**  plowed and sprayed, there ain't no snails.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:36:52):**  Here there's tons of them.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:36:54):**  So yeah, yeah.  
**[0:36:57-0:36:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:36:57):**  Have you tried running ducks through there?  
**[0:36:59-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:36:59):**  I mean, I know you want to eat them for yourself too.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:37:00):**  And I tried them, I made caldo de caracol last, I think it was last autumn when the  
**[0:37:07-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:37:07):**  first rains came back from when I had first moved here.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:37:10):**  And it's a process, but yeah, they're delicious.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:37:13):**  And I look forward to trying more recipes.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:37:14):**  So like, have you thought about running some other animals through there to kind of help  
**[0:37:18-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:37:18):**  with the maintenance of it and kind of keep them at bay?  
**[0:37:22-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:37:22):**  Yeah, I mean, that's a broad question because there's some areas that I have to manicure  
**[0:37:26-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:37:26):**  more than others.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:37:27):**  And there's some that are further out.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:37:29):**  So the more manicured areas, I can just get away with mowing between the rows.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:37:37):**  And they're not a pest like the snails.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:37:39):**  The slugs might be a little pest in the vegetable garden, but even so, with the diversity we  
**[0:37:45-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:37:45):**  have, say like, I mean, Swiss chard just grows on its own and the slugs seem to prefer that  
**[0:37:51-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:37:51):**  than the vegetables we actually plant.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:37:55):**  And then we've got a key line pattern where we planted the 5000 trees on this field that  
**[0:37:59-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:37:59):**  was wheat and sunflowers.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:38:01):**  And between the key lines, we just graze in the summer, we graze our horses and donkeys.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:38:07):**  We make a paddock for a week and they graze it and then move them on.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:38:12):**  And that works really well because the animals have got food the whole summer, they're cycling  
**[0:38:16-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:38:16):**  the nutrient and pooping it back out.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:38:17):**  And when the rains come, the grass grows again and the manure goes back into the soil.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:38:22):**  So we don't actually have a snail or a slug problem to be honest, unless it's really,  
**[0:38:28-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:38:28):**  really moist for a prolonged period and they're in the vegetable garden trying to eat the  
**[0:38:32-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:38:32):**  kale.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:38:33):**  The kale is something the owner really likes.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:38:34):**  It might be a problem to talk too much about kale.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:38:37):**  Snails and snails actually, I found that it's quite harmonious just because we have so much  
**[0:38:42-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:38:42):**  diversity on the land.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:38:44):**  And also I guess having a dry climate does help.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:38:48):**  The thing about the dry climate is you can grow anything if you have water.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:38:51):**  Water is one of our biggest challenges because our wells dry out during the summer.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:38:55):**  But what I've seen with this centropic style of planting, I could get away with if I plant  
**[0:39:00-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:39:00):**  at the right time between September and December and we get a good spring rain, I wouldn't  
**[0:39:05-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:39:05):**  have to water during the summer.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:39:07):**  Okay, all the things wouldn't grow very much.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:39:11):**  I could get away, the plants would survive and then go through another cycle and get  
**[0:39:14-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:39:14):**  stronger.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:39:15):**  And then if I do water, then they grow a bit quicker and get a bit stronger and get more  
**[0:39:19-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:39:19):**  yields quicker.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:39:20):**  But with this way of planting so densely and mimicking nature, actually, as long as I've  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:39:28):**  got ground cover on the soil, then watering is super minimal.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:39:33):**  Whereas if I plant just one tree over here, one tree over there, then really you need  
**[0:39:37-0:39:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:39:37):**  to water because otherwise it's going to be screwed.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:39:40):**  So having the diversification of roots.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:39:43):**  Another thing about centropic families, they always have living plants in the soil.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:39:47):**  When you have living plants in the soil, you're getting those ecosystem services, you're getting  
**[0:39:52-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:39:52):**  capture of moisture from the air, you're getting carbohydrates put into the soil and protection  
**[0:39:58-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:39:58):**  for other plants as well.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:40:00):**  Like the rosemary is protecting the oak trees while the tiny for example.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:40:06):**  So really, when you work with nature, the solution has become so, so clear.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:40:11):**  At least in my mind.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:40:12):**  Yeah, yeah, no, for sure.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:40:14):**  And it's, you know, it comes from observation and it comes from patience.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:40:17):**  But certainly, though four years is not long in the bigger vision of a landscape like this,  
**[0:40:27-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:40:27):**  it sounds like it's sufficient to really kind of start to hone that ability to pay more  
**[0:40:34-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:40:34):**  attention and get better at listening rather than this is my agenda, this is what I want  
**[0:40:38-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:40:38):**  out of it.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:40:39):**  And solutions always present themselves when you're willing to listen.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:40:43):**  Completely.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:40:44):**  And I mean, even in this Mediterranean climate where we can have no rain for eight months  
**[0:40:51-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:40:51):**  of the year, and 45 Celsius or 110 Fahrenheit in the summer and zero Celsius or 30 Fahrenheit  
**[0:40:58-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:40:58):**  in the winter, I'm still seeing trees that have grown three meters in two to four years.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:41:08):**  It's not like you can't do things here.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:41:11):**  It's just you have to understand it.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:41:13):**  Whereas yeah, in the tropics, it would be much quicker in a temperate zone probably  
**[0:41:16-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:41:16):**  as well, but there's so much growth potential, even in these Mediterranean climates, which  
**[0:41:24-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:41:24):**  is good to see because most people around here are totally like, no, you can't do that.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:41:28):**  You can't have that green in the summer.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:41:30):**  But they're just so blind by their belief system that when you look a bit past that,  
**[0:41:36-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:41:36):**  actually, yeah, a lot is possible.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:41:38):**  Honestly, it shocked me too, because when you kind of look at the areas around here  
**[0:41:43-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:41:43):**  in Catalunya, so we have a very similar climate, but being closer to the Mediterranean Sea,  
**[0:41:48-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:41:48):**  we don't get quite as wide a variation of temperatures.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:41:52):**  So it's not quite as hot in the summer, and it's not quite as cold in the winter until  
**[0:41:57-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:41:57):**  you start getting further inland.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:41:58):**  And then, of course, the rainfall starts to dissipate a little bit.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:42:04):**  I haven't explored around nearly as much as I would like to, but I have been down not  
**[0:42:07-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:42:07):**  far from the areas and further south on the Costa del Sol and seen how it dries out significantly  
**[0:42:17-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:42:17):**  as you start getting down towards your areas.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:42:19):**  And I've heard all the stories of how cold and windy it gets on the plains in the center  
**[0:42:24-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:42:24):**  and how much desertification is starting to creep in.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:42:27):**  It's a big problem for the whole peninsula.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:42:31):**  But with that said, when you get away from places that have been so actively managed,  
**[0:42:36-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:42:36):**  like I was talking about going to walk around the area here with my girlfriend or father,  
**[0:42:44-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:42:44):**  you get down into these little paths that either follow along a river and haven't been  
**[0:42:49-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:42:49):**  plowed or tilled, and it looks like a jungle rainforest.  
**[0:42:54-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:42:54):**  I was absolutely blown away by just how thick the vegetation was and how abundant the biodiversity  
**[0:43:00-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:43:00):**  was as soon as you just get to a place where people have left it alone and there's a little  
**[0:43:04-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:43:04):**  bit of access to water.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:43:08):**  And stunned to realize, because I've been doing some research and stuff, that pretty  
**[0:43:13-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:43:13):**  much the whole peninsula was like this a couple of hundred years ago.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:43:17):**  I mean, definitely there's a long period of history and tradition of cultivation of wheat  
**[0:43:22-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:43:22):**  and vineyards.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:43:23):**  And what are some of the other major ones around here?  
**[0:43:27-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:43:27):**  There's been a lot of, well, this area there's been a lot of hazelnuts.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:43:32):**  The castañas, the what are they called?  
**[0:43:35-0:43:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:43:35):**  Chestnuts.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:43:36):**  Abeyanas, yeah, for this area.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:43:39):**  And then the chestnuts.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:43:42):**  And you know, figs and all of these other things that you sort of associate with this  
**[0:43:46-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:43:46):**  area.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:43:47):**  But then like the abundance in the forest.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:43:50):**  This is a very prominent area for the harvesting of cork oak.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:43:56):**  And I went to a museum that's not far from here up towards Girona.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:44:00):**  That's the Cork Museum.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:44:02):**  And they still have like all of the old tools and videos of people harvesting this and how  
**[0:44:09-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:44:09):**  it goes in this cycle of 12 years where the bark grows back.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:44:13):**  And it incentivized very careful management of the entire community to take care of these  
**[0:44:21-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:44:21):**  ancient forests.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:44:23):**  And realizing that it's a big part of the economy and there is incentive to do it.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:44:28):**  I've just been really geeking out on the history of land use in this area.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:44:31):**  It's actually incredible.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:44:32):**  Yeah, that must be a big hit as well.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:44:36):**  The demolish of the commons.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:44:38):**  Like they used to be much more clear land.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:44:41):**  And the desa is famous, right?  
**[0:44:44-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:44:44):**  The desa in Spain and Portugal, they call it montado, the savanna with the oaks and  
**[0:44:49-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:44:49):**  the pigs and other grazing animals and much more diversity of trees.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:44:55):**  And then like I said, yeah, 50 years ago, the tractors came in, at least here in the  
**[0:45:00-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:45:00):**  south and they just degraded it.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:45:02):**  I speak to a older guy, he's an artist, he's in his 60s.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:45:05):**  He said in the year 1967-68, he left to go to boarding school.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:45:11):**  And he came back and the landscape had completely changed.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:45:14):**  He described the landscape as before he left, Frondoso, which is lush and full of water.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:45:21):**  Now you see it and it's like super desertified just from the plough and chemicals, chemical  
**[0:45:28-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:45:28):**  uses.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:45:29):**  But then when you let that accumulate organic matter and get some shade, it's amazing how  
**[0:45:36-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:45:36):**  quickly it can respond and change the microclimate and provide abundance.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:45:41):**  But we've kind of been led down off of get big or get out and the people have been taken  
**[0:45:46-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:45:46):**  off the land.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:45:47):**  I mean, you don't see other people on the land hardly.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:45:49):**  You see a few tractors and that's it.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:45:52):**  Right now they're harvesting the wheat.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:45:53):**  There's these huge combines.  
**[0:45:57-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:45:57):**  But it doesn't have to be like that.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:45:58):**  I mean, we could regenerate these huge wheat fields, even have say one acre wheat fields.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:46:03):**  Yeah, sure, but have borders around them of the fish and chopper farms that can have various  
**[0:46:08-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:46:08):**  yields and attract animals and stabilize ecosystems while having still a large scale annual production,  
**[0:46:16-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:46:16):**  but more ecosystem services.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:46:18):**  Those ecosystem services have just been completely abolished, unfortunately.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:46:21):**  Well, one of the things that blew my mind is like, I think you sent it was you who sent  
**[0:46:26-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:46:26):**  me the article about how they've changed the olive production.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:46:30):**  That was actually the other tree that I was going to mention.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:46:32):**  That's like the traditional crop from this area is these olive trees that do so well  
**[0:46:36-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:46:36):**  in the dry conditions and put out such amazing fruit with all.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:46:41):**  I mean, if you think of super fruits, the olive is right up there.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:46:47):**  But even these mature perennial systems can be managed when it's done in this extractive  
**[0:46:52-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:46:52):**  manner and how these massive, massive oil plant or olive oil plantations have been put  
**[0:46:59-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:46:59):**  in completely undercutting the ecosystem services that they have.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:47:03):**  And it's what is it depleting the aquifer of that region some 400 times faster than  
**[0:47:08-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:47:08):**  it's being replenished.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:47:10):**  And so there's a couple of years, maybe a decade left in being able to do this.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:47:15):**  And then what's left, like you won't even be able to get groundwater out.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:47:18):**  So who's going to move back there?  
**[0:47:20-0:47:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:47:20):**  I mean, you can't even get water to do your washing and your cooking.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:47:24):**  It's insane.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:47:25):**  Very short sighted.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:47:27):**  And now there's the intensive olive orchards going in.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:47:30):**  I manage an ancient olive orchard that's about 150 to 200 years old.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:47:35):**  The trees in it, 800 trees.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:47:38):**  And most of those orchards have been pulled out.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:47:40):**  Unfortunately, they're like a 10 meter or 12 meter spacing.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:47:44):**  And now they're putting in these olive trees that are about half a meter apart, even with  
**[0:47:49-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:47:49):**  stakes and they mound up the soil and irrigate the groundwater.  
**[0:47:53-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:47:53):**  And it's just not the same olive oil that would have happened in the past.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:47:58):**  It's this extractive thing, as you say, whereas the older trees, they have to be more maintained.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:48:03):**  Obviously they have to be more pruned.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:48:06):**  You need to bring in herds of animals to manage the ground cover.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:48:09):**  You can grow things in between.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:48:11):**  But it's, yeah, you get in a higher yield, but at what cost?  
**[0:48:18-0:48:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:48:18):**  And I'm sure you remember, it was really prominent in your area before all the coronavirus stuff  
**[0:48:23-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:48:23):**  happened.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:48:24):**  The big news in Spain was all of the protests from the farmers, especially from the southern  
**[0:48:28-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:48:28):**  regions, because of the dropping out of olive oil prices and the fact that they couldn't  
**[0:48:33-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:48:33):**  make a living even with this higher intensity method of production.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:48:37):**  It's like, well, how could you not?  
**[0:48:39-0:48:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:48:39):**  I mean, look, I sympathize definitely with the farming community and they've been trampled  
**[0:48:43-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:48:43):**  for forever.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:48:44):**  They've always been a marginalized economic community.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:48:48):**  But at the same time, I mean, there was only one way that that could result when you start  
**[0:48:53-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:48:53):**  to extract all of the resources from the land and create these like hyperintensive production  
**[0:49:00-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:49:00):**  models.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:49:01):**  Of course, the price is going to drop out because you flooded the market and the cost  
**[0:49:06-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:49:06):**  of production is super high because it's hard to get water.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:49:09):**  It's hard to get chemicals and it's increasingly more expensive.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:49:12):**  And so those correlations are going to only result in abandonment of rural land and lower  
**[0:49:20-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:49:20):**  and lower prices for those producers.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:49:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:49:23):**  I have a really good mentor in the olive production.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:49:26):**  He manages some large thinkers and he basically said the future in olive production is inorganic  
**[0:49:34-0:49:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:49:34):**  because you can't make a living out of the conventional and as well as the ecosystem  
**[0:49:41-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:49:41):**  benefits of organic.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:49:42):**  It's a higher price and you can do it with much less inputs.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:49:45):**  It's just people have been so blindsided by your inputs from the co-op, from the ag salesman.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:49:52):**  But actually like we're making inputs for olive grove that have nitrogen, have potassium,  
**[0:49:57-0:50:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:49:57):**  have phosphorus for five cents a liter.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:50:00):**  And that one liter gets diluted to 10 liters and maybe I'll put five liters diluted per  
**[0:50:07-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:50:07):**  tree once a year or twice a year.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:50:11):**  And we're talking for a few hundred euros in an IBC tote on the back of a pickup truck  
**[0:50:18-0:50:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:50:18):**  with a 12 volt pump, I can fertilize my whole olive orchard for a couple of hundred euros  
**[0:50:26-0:50:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:50:26):**  a year when people are paying thousands of euros a hectare even.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:50:31):**  A thousand euros a hectare for conventional chemical fertilizers which is bankrupting  
**[0:50:37-0:50:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:50:37):**  them.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:50:38):**  It's just that people need to be open to the knowledge.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:50:41):**  I'm on members of some groups on Facebook that olive world would be roughly translated  
**[0:50:47-0:50:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:50:47):**  and there's people that just put questions like I've got this herbaceous plant growing,  
**[0:50:51-0:50:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:50:51):**  what herbicide can I put on?  
**[0:50:53-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:50:53):**  And then there's like 50 people that reply that like, you're fighting the wrong battle.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:51:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:51:01):**  You're fighting the wrong battle.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:51:03):**  Or at least the losing one.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:51:05):**  There's no point at which you win that.  
**[0:51:08-0:51:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:51:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:51:09):**  And it's so simple.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:51:11):**  This is a cycle of degradation and higher costs.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:51:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:51:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:51:17):**  And Richard Perkins said on the previous interview you did with him, it's all about pride.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:51:21):**  These old ways of farming, I said my father did it so I'm going to do it like this and  
**[0:51:26-0:51:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:51:26):**  it's how we always do it.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:51:29):**  But as more and more people are seeing the degradation, especially young people, there's  
**[0:51:33-0:51:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:51:33):**  no incentive for young people to go into that kind of farming.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:51:36):**  So young people are going in, they're going in with fresh mind.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:51:40):**  They have different business plans too.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:51:44):**  The average age of farmers here is in the 60s and they're probably not going to change  
**[0:51:49-0:51:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:51:49):**  out of pride and they've always done it this way but it's up to the young people now to  
**[0:51:53-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:51:53):**  take that on.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:51:56):**  I mean the subsidy system is a big problem as well because they pay you to do losing  
**[0:52:00-0:52:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:52:00):**  money things like grow wheat and sunflowers in our region, dry farm them.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:52:06):**  And wheat comes in way cheaper from the States and Canada on boats than from Spain.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:52:12):**  But then they pay you from the subsidy so people have got no incentive to change because  
**[0:52:17-0:52:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:52:17):**  the subsidy says okay well I'll pay X amount for growing this crop.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:52:23):**  Sometimes they actually leave the sunflowers in the field because they get the subsidy  
**[0:52:26-0:52:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:52:26):**  and it's not even worth harvesting because they would lose money if they harvested it.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:52:30):**  Yeah I've heard that all over the world.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:52:37):**  So it's a desertification subsidy.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:52:39):**  The European Union says oh yeah food security, but actually it's creating more deserts.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:52:46):**  Yep.  
**[0:52:47-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:52:47):**  And also these methods are really what are behind the flight from rural areas like I  
**[0:52:52-0:52:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:52:52):**  mentioned before.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:52:53):**  It's like with higher mechanization there's less jobs and it's driving down prices so  
**[0:52:58-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:52:58):**  there's really no other economy for people to make a living off of in those areas.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:53:04):**  And so you have giant mechanized fields and no more of this culture of small towns that  
**[0:53:12-0:53:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:53:12):**  have sort of vibrant traditions and local identities that quite frankly this part of  
**[0:53:17-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:53:17):**  the world was so famous for for such a long time.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:53:21):**  And it's such a shame that that's becoming like a tourism novelty rather than the way  
**[0:53:25-0:53:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:53:25):**  of life that gave it real meaning and depth.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:53:29):**  But it's like the same all of these problems while they have fairly simple solutions the  
**[0:53:36-0:53:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:53:36):**  solutions also come in packs.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:53:39):**  So you start to manipulate and degrade the landscape.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:53:42):**  It comes along with cultural degradation and health degradation and whatnot.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:53:47):**  Whereas if you start to work from the ground up and kind of kickstart these systems it  
**[0:53:52-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:53:52):**  comes with the rejuvenation of cultural activity of local economies of personal health of community  
**[0:53:58-0:53:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:53:58):**  building.  
**[0:53:59-0:54:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:53:59):**  And I'm just kind of now really starting to understand and explore through other resources  
**[0:54:06-0:54:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:54:06):**  how you can start to kickstart the environmental regeneration through the community side as  
**[0:54:12-0:54:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:54:12):**  well and that it doesn't always have to come from the initiation of landscape things that  
**[0:54:18-0:54:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:54:18):**  can come from other I guess spark points around the community as well.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:54:25):**  Totally and I mean I'm seeing that I agree completely with what you say it's like the  
**[0:54:28-0:54:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:54:28):**  desertification of the land the desertification of the demographic.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:54:32):**  And one thing we're looking at doing in the future is value added products with our tree  
**[0:54:37-0:54:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:54:37):**  crops so we can grow figs, we can grow madronio, almonds, carob, mulberries, olives, pomegranates.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:54:47):**  There's a long list of things that we're growing and that we're growing at scale and the idea  
**[0:54:51-0:54:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:54:51):**  is when we're getting larger harvest and not to mention the acorns like acorn flower is  
**[0:54:56-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:54:56):**  amazing is to be able to create value added products and create industry through that  
**[0:55:01-0:55:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:55:01):**  because as we're a yoga center we get a lot of foreigners coming through and we can charge  
**[0:55:07-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:55:07):**  a higher price for our products so we sell our olive oil through our shop we can charge  
**[0:55:11-0:55:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:55:11):**  15 euros a liter for it rather than at the market it might be two or three euros a liter  
**[0:55:16-0:55:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:55:16):**  the commodity market so we've got us fucked up in that market but if we can then create  
**[0:55:21-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:55:21):**  brands that add value and people know and trust and respect and that are creating jobs  
**[0:55:26-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:55:26):**  and you're generating London livelihoods they can grow exponentially and we can be an example  
**[0:55:33-0:55:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:55:33):**  also by for us trying out these things and trying and failing and seeing what works and  
**[0:55:38-0:55:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:55:38):**  what genetics work if people are open we can share that with them that's the idea we do  
**[0:55:44-0:55:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:55:44):**  offer farm tours to local people a couple of times a year and we do have good conversations  
**[0:55:49-0:55:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:55:49):**  and dinners and there are many people that say yeah it's a shame that what's happened  
**[0:55:54-0:55:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:55:54):**  and I remember a time when things were different and so there is there is a lot of hope out  
**[0:55:59-0:56:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:55:59):**  there as well.  
**[0:56:00-0:56:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:56:00):**  Yeah yeah for sure and you know it's funny because the interview that we're doing right  
**[0:56:06-0:56:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:56:06):**  now and the one that I just did earlier today are going to come out a week apart but I just  
**[0:56:09-0:56:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:56:09):**  got finished today speaking with Alfonso from the Alvelaad project in the Altiplano region  
**[0:56:16-0:56:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:56:16):**  not terribly far from you guys but with a very very similar context and it's also where  
**[0:56:21-0:56:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:56:21):**  the Altiplano camp for ecosystem restoration camps is located and they're working in close  
**[0:56:27-0:56:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:56:27):**  cooperation but he echoed so many of the things that you're saying that you know they've started  
**[0:56:32-0:56:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:56:32):**  to advance this niche higher quality product market and value-added product market for  
**[0:56:40-0:56:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:56:40):**  the farmers that have started to adopt these healthier management techniques and they're  
**[0:56:45-0:56:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:56:45):**  very quickly saying that like you know if you want to couple it with a sustainability  
**[0:56:51-0:56:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:56:51):**  model, this is really the only way to make any money off these crops anymore because  
**[0:56:55-0:56:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:56:55):**  doing it at scale with all of those inputs that we mentioned like you're just running  
**[0:56:59-0:57:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:56:59):**  yourself deeper into the ground but it's really cool to see this sort of echoed from different  
**[0:57:04-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:57:04):**  sites in the region and you know hopefully with further cooperation this growing sort  
**[0:57:10-0:57:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:57:10):**  of micro economy can start to really have an effect and maybe even hold some sway over  
**[0:57:16-0:57:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:57:16):**  national policy as it becomes more established and people can really see that this is the  
**[0:57:22-0:57:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:57:22):**  only way forward for the health and the resilience and the identity of the Iberian Peninsula.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:57:28):**  Well for the whole world for that matter.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:57:30):**  I mean the closer we can get to the consumer the better.  
**[0:57:33-0:57:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:57:33):**  I mean I know I don't remember the name on my head but there's an organic almond growing  
**[0:57:37-0:57:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:57:37):**  cooperative in that region around the Alta Plano.  
**[0:57:41-0:57:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:57:41):**  I think that's probably the same one.  
**[0:57:44-0:57:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:57:44):**  Yeah okay yeah they're selling direct and they're getting a good price for their almonds  
**[0:57:48-0:57:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:57:48):**  and they're doing a much more regenerative approach.  
**[0:57:52-0:57:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:57:52):**  What is it called?  
**[0:57:54-0:57:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:57:54):**  Yeah almondresa?  
**[0:57:55-0:57:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:57:55):**  Is that the one you think?  
**[0:57:57-0:57:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:57:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:58-0:57:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:57:58):**  Yep that's the same guys.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:57:59):**  Yep.  
**[0:58:00-0:58:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:58:00):**  Oh good good to hear good to hear because they're doing great work hats off to them.  
**[0:58:05-0:58:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:58:05):**  Yeah so I can't remember if I have scheduled this interview to come out before or after  
**[0:58:10-0:58:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:58:10):**  Alejandro or Alfonso's but if anybody's listening to this and wants to hear the other one either  
**[0:58:15-0:58:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:58:15):**  wait a week or go back a week because they're definitely going to come together and it'll  
**[0:58:20-0:58:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:58:20):**  sort of reinforce what we're just talking about briefly here.  
**[0:58:23-0:58:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:58:23):**  Well so look we are starting to run out of time a little bit but it's always fantastic  
**[0:58:29-0:58:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:58:29):**  to catch up with you and I know you and I are kind of toying at the idea of doing some  
**[0:58:33-0:58:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:58:33):**  work together you might even be looking at a move in the future and further cooperation  
**[0:58:39-0:58:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-evans/#t=0:58:39):**  I'm really excited about and yeah for if anybody's interested in finding out more about this

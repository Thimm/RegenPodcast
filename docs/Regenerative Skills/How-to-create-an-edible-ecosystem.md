### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 12 Feb 2021 06:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:00:00):**  I'm sure you haven't heard a lot of examples of people who started living in a homestead  
**[0:00:10-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:00:10):**  in an idyllic location and then gave up that lifestyle to move to the suburbs, but that's  
**[0:00:16-0:00:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:00:16):**  literally what I did in the last two years.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:00:19):**  So let me start from the beginning.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:00:22):**  This is Regenerative Skills, the podcast helping you to learn the skills and solutions to create  
**[0:00:27-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:00:27):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:00:29):**  I'm your host, Oliver Goshen.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:00:33):**  For regular listeners of the Abundant Edge podcast from previous seasons will know that  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:00:37):**  I started the show when I was helping my colleagues to build a demonstration farm and permaculture  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:00:42):**  homestead in the highlands of rural Guatemala on the shores of Lake Atitlan in a Mayan village  
**[0:00:48-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:00:48):**  of Cachiquel speakers.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:00:50):**  And my goodness, there were some incredible challenges.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:00:53):**  We ended up building most of the bamboo house during the rainy season and I was camping  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:00:59):**  under the roof before the walls were filled in and we were cooking out of our tool shed  
**[0:01:04-0:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:01:04):**  and there were just so many crazy challenges along the way.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:01:07):**  But I loved it.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:01:08):**  I loved every minute of it.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:01:09):**  I mean, there were definitely difficult times, but it felt like it was the lifestyle that  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:01:14):**  I wanted to be building for myself and my crew and being involved with a community in  
**[0:01:19-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:01:19):**  a way that I just hadn't been able to invest in in previous projects in my life.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:01:25):**  And it was difficult for me to give that up, but I'm really happy that I did because I  
**[0:01:30-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:01:30):**  was able to come here to the suburbs of Barcelona.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:01:33):**  There's a beautiful region of Spain and start a brand new life with the woman that I love.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:01:39):**  But at the moment we live in a small apartment about 30 minutes outside of Barcelona, not  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:01:43):**  too far from kind of more rural areas and close to the mountains.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:01:48):**  There's some really beautiful parts around here, but it's still limiting.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:01:51):**  I'm used to having a larger garden and planting more of my food, feeling a sense of independence.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:01:55):**  It's something that I've always wanted to continue to expand upon.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:02:01):**  This transition and trying to figure out how my skill set can fit in this new environment  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:02:06):**  has gotten me thinking about a good friend of mine who I actually met in person for the  
**[0:02:10-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:02:10):**  first time in Guatemala.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:02:12):**  Now Zach Lokes is the author of two of some of my favorite books, including The Permaculture  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:02:16):**  Market Garden and his new volume, The Edible Ecosystem Solution.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:02:21):**  Now Zach has quite a wide range of experience and has worked on larger farms including market  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:02:26):**  gardens in Canada, but in his newer book focuses more on the urban and suburban environment  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:02:31):**  and how you can create edible ecosystems just about anywhere and even in the smallest spaces.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:02:37):**  Zach is an educator, designer, and grower who specializes in edible ecosystem design  
**[0:02:42-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:02:42):**  through landscaping and education.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:02:45):**  He consults widely with homes, farms, colleges, schools, and municipalities all across Canada  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:02:50):**  and the United States and through many biomes from Guatemala, like where we met, then South  
**[0:02:55-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:02:55):**  Africa to the Yukon and even Mongolia.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:02:58):**  But edible ecosystems kind of sounds like a fancy word for a garden or a farm, right?  
**[0:03:03-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:03:03):**  Like I think the key thing is understanding that ecosystems are biodiverse.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:03:11):**  You don't find any sort of ecological landscape that isn't diverse, right?  
**[0:03:17-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:03:17):**  So a farm can be diverse, but it can also be a monoculture and a yard can be diverse,  
**[0:03:24-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:03:24):**  but it can also be a monoculture.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:03:27):**  Or even if it's not a monoculture and someone says, well, we do have some different species  
**[0:03:32-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:03:32):**  on the farm.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:03:33):**  Okay.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:03:34):**  Are they grown in blocks where you have, you know, an acre in carrots and then an acre  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:03:39):**  in cover crop and it's organically managed?  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:03:43):**  And this is great, like having crop rotations and having cover crops that serve as, you  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:03:47):**  know, also green manures and all the other, you know, organic principles, but ultimately  
**[0:03:53-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:03:53):**  they're still being grown in a way where they're segregated and ecosystems aren't.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:03:59):**  Ecosystems are always integrated and they're diverse.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:04:02):**  And so this is a key component to understand in the design process that I like to share,  
**[0:04:07-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:04:07):**  you know.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:04:09):**  So it really is about that diversity and then the connection between things like a zoo is  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:04:14):**  very diverse, but it's hardly a thriving ecosystem because there's no interactions, right?  
**[0:04:19-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:04:19):**  That's a key element to it.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:04:21):**  I like that.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:04:22):**  I've never, I never really thought of that analogy, but yeah, they're all fenced off  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:04:26):**  from each other, you know, which is good, I guess, in a zoo context, otherwise the lions  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:04:30):**  would go eat everything, but that's the cycle of life.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:04:33):**  We need that, you know, we need that movement and that companionship.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:04:37):**  Well, this is why I'm really glad that I reached out to you because, you know, you come from  
**[0:04:42-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:04:42):**  especially the farming background that you have, the market gardening and how I met you  
**[0:04:46-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:04:46):**  in the beginning.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:04:47):**  And now you sort of turn this lens into more of the urban landscape and the suburban areas.  
**[0:04:53-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:04:53):**  Tell me about what transfers well and what is uniquely different about those human settlements.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:05:00):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:05:01):**  Yeah, I mean, I think like what's cool is the scalable nature of ecosystems.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:05:08):**  So I think, you know, I had this sort of Eureka moment in my own kind of understanding of  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:05:14):**  ecology where it's not even that I didn't understand it before, but it's like I re-understood  
**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:05:19):**  it from a certain point of view.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:05:22):**  And that's that, you know, landscapes, ecological landscapes, biomes, you know, whatever scale  
**[0:05:29-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:05:29):**  you want to understand the biodiversity that is our world ecosystems is completely scalable.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:05:38):**  And, you know, one moment I had was when I was working in the boreal forest, you know,  
**[0:05:43-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:05:43):**  many years ago and I saw this log that had been lying for many years in a burned forest  
**[0:05:53-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:05:53):**  stand.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:05:54):**  And if you looked inside the log, there was this microcosm of fungi growing around the  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:06:00):**  inside in these concentric circles.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:06:03):**  And there was spider webs and there was all these critters like decaying it.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:06:07):**  And on the top of the log, there was like ferns that were starting to grow in the decaying  
**[0:06:11-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:06:11):**  wood on top.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:06:12):**  And, you know, it was even serving as a nurse log for trees that had germinated in and around  
**[0:06:18-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:06:18):**  the log and understand that that was an entire ecosystem right there.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:06:25):**  And thinking, wait, this ecosystem right here, this new kind of emerging ecosystem has all  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:06:33):**  the benefits, all the functionality, all the understanding that we have about ecosystem  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:06:38):**  dynamics right in this micro landscape.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:06:41):**  Maybe it's about 25 square feet.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:06:43):**  And the same occurs in any spot of land.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:06:48):**  If we look at a spot of land, whether it's just a section of garden bed in your garden  
**[0:06:53-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:06:53):**  or a section of field in your larger farm crop rotation or a section of lawn in the  
**[0:07:00-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:07:00):**  suburbs or a section of park in an urban area, all of these have the potential to be micro  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:07:08):**  ecosystems with all those benefits.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:07:11):**  And then when we put them all together, we have big benefits and they don't necessarily  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:07:17):**  have to be converting an entire park or an entire lawn or an entire farm because many  
**[0:07:22-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:07:22):**  small spots still are impacting the global system for those sorts of ecosystem benefits  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:07:29):**  we love, like the creation of oxygen and carbon sequestration and the production of soil and,  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:07:35):**  you know, habitat for endangered species and especially even the things that we really  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:07:40):**  want to see immediately in our communities in these trying times, which is food production  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:07:45):**  right there on these trees, you know, food security from pears and cherries and all that.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:07:49):**  So, you know, that's where I kind of really started to get really interested again in  
**[0:07:55-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:07:55):**  these in micro landscapes was, you know, looking back at that understanding.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:08:01):**  But then to kind of tie back into your question, when I was on book tour a lot for the Permaculture  
**[0:08:06-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:08:06):**  Market Garden, I was just seeing so much underutilized land in little pockets and communities and  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:08:16):**  seeing all that potential that could go into this underutilized land, which is everywhere.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:08:20):**  You know, it's really a blank page.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:08:23):**  So given that there's this blank page of underutilized land all around us, tell me how we can get  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:08:28):**  started in selecting a spot and prepare it for planting.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:08:32):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:08:33):**  So I mean, essentially, this is an extension of the Perma bed system by looking micro scale  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:08:40):**  at it and then building on it in a way that really makes sense.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:08:44):**  That's modular.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:08:45):**  And, you know, the first thing you want to do is find a piece of land that you're deciding  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:08:50):**  that you want to transition from lawn or from grass or from, you know, whatever it is that  
**[0:08:55-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:08:55):**  you want in turning it into an edible landscape or a garden.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:09:01):**  And I call it a garden spot.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:09:03):**  You know, it's a spot.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:09:05):**  It's a piece.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:09:06):**  It's twenty five square feet.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:09:07):**  But it could be a five by hundred foot bed.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:09:12):**  It's the same principles of design.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:09:14):**  It's just in this case, we're talking about the micro micro landscape.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:09:18):**  I work by a philosophy that all of our gardening sites should be in permanent raised beds or  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:09:25):**  permanent beds or built up mounds because it automatically is going to improve drainage  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:09:31):**  and you should be integrating organic matter because that's automatically going to improve  
**[0:09:35-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:09:35):**  soil aggregation, soil fertility.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:09:37):**  So it's almost like a design fits all approach, you know, and this is really like this is  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:09:43):**  the methodology that is coming out of the Edible Ecosystem Solution book.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:09:47):**  And this is the methodology that's coming out of the Ecosystem U Academy that we just  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:09:52):**  launched is that there are these solutions that can be applied in a lot of different  
**[0:09:57-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:09:57):**  places in the same manner.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:10:00):**  And that's because, you know, it doesn't matter like if a site is got poor drainage or has  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:10:05):**  good drainage, they're both going to benefit from this.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:10:09):**  So you don't have to be as concerned about really knowing everything you might need to  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:10:14):**  know.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:10:15):**  Dig down, turn that soil, dig down again and turn that soil.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:10:20):**  Right.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:10:21):**  So you're doing that double dig, you're digging, turning and then digging again and turning  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:10:26):**  and add in, you know, compost or composted manure is even better.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:10:31):**  You know, I always drive around the countryside and look for farms where they have big piles  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:10:37):**  of manure that look like they've just been sitting for a while, like that they might  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:10:41):**  be occasionally turning it to keep the weeds down and things like that.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:10:44):**  But they're but they're not really using it.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:10:46):**  And this is usually a red flag, a green flag, excuse me, of that they probably be fine to  
**[0:10:52-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:10:52):**  sell it to you.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:10:54):**  But I like to say, you know, four, six, eight, you know, 12 inches, depending on what you're  
**[0:10:58-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:10:58):**  doing.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:10:59):**  And that creates the raised bed.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:11:01):**  OK, perfect.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:11:02):**  So now we have our garden plot selected.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:11:05):**  We've double dug the soil to loosen it up and added lots of compost and organic matter,  
**[0:11:10-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:11:10):**  mounted it up for better drainage.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:11:12):**  I'm ready to get planting.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:11:14):**  Now, since we're aiming to create a functioning ecosystem, shouldn't I just scatter the seeds  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:11:18):**  and plant things around randomly to mimic a wild ecosystem?  
**[0:11:22-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:11:22):**  I really like to push back against this, the design philosophy that sometimes is starting  
**[0:11:29-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:11:29):**  to creep out into the permaculture world of being very wild and how we go about planting  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:11:37):**  and being very wild and how we go about designing.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:11:41):**  I really, really don't think design is about being wild.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:11:45):**  I think design is about being organized and then plants will be wild, but the wild within  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:11:51):**  the organization that allows you to care for them and to get them established so that you  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:11:56):**  can really succeed, because going out and throwing a bunch of random seeds into your  
**[0:12:00-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:12:00):**  yard often won't result in very much.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:12:03):**  And planting fruit trees willy nilly across your property won't result in very much.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:12:08):**  Got it.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:12:09):**  So even though we might let the plants grow a bit wildly as they mature, we have to start  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:12:13):**  with an organized design if we want to promote fast growth, get a better yield and create  
**[0:12:19-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:12:19):**  for easier maintenance.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:12:21):**  But how do I go about selecting plants from all of the tons of varieties available out  
**[0:12:25-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:12:25):**  there?  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:12:26):**  So like sometimes I just like to think, OK, well, you know, one of the best things to  
**[0:12:30-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:12:30):**  do is to pick plants that have different shapes and forms and different sizes at maturity,  
**[0:12:37-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:12:37):**  because that's like a primary thing.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:12:40):**  And of course, all the inspiration for the book and this design work and the design work  
**[0:12:44-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:12:44):**  is so many great designers out there comes from looking at nature.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:12:47):**  Right.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:12:48):**  And like natural ecosystems and woodlands are one of my big inspiration draws and prairies.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:12:55):**  They're layered.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:12:56):**  They, you know, they have big trees and they have medium trees and they have shrubs and  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:13:01):**  they have bushes and they have little creeping ground covers and like more upright herbs.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:13:06):**  And so one of the first questions, you know, in terms of finding companion plants is like,  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:13:10):**  well, what layers are you going to represent?  
**[0:13:14-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:13:14):**  And you know, the sunnier your spot, the sunnier your spot is and the more spot space for spots  
**[0:13:21-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:13:21):**  you have, the more layers you can include in your design.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:13:24):**  But you know, your design should at least have three layers.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:13:28):**  You know, that's the rule of three, right?  
**[0:13:30-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:13:30):**  You should have at least three layers.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:13:31):**  And every single spot needs to have a key species, which means something that you're  
**[0:13:37-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:13:37):**  focused on.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:13:38):**  And then it should probably have a couple companions that you choose for it.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:13:43):**  And it needs to have a ground cover.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:13:45):**  And then you can get into like more intricate design of trying to, I always say ecosystem  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:13:51):**  designs about form, function and potential.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:13:54):**  So you know, that's the form.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:13:56):**  And then you can say, now I'm going to do the next layer of design where I'm going to  
**[0:13:59-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:13:59):**  look for function.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:14:00):**  And I might specifically choose plants in this case for a specific function.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:14:05):**  An example of that would be my key species is a Asian pear tree.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:14:10):**  And I'm going to pick a plant that attracts pollinators ahead of when my Asian pear is  
**[0:14:16-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:14:16):**  going to flower.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:14:17):**  So they're already in the neighborhood.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:14:20):**  That's designing for function, because you can find plants that attract pollinators.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:14:25):**  And that's a part of ecosystem.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:14:26):**  That's one of those functions that happens in the diversified wild fruit forests of Eurasia  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:14:32):**  is that there's all these flowering plants.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:14:34):**  And so there's always pollinators in the neighborhood for each other.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:14:38):**  And they're all that's all helping each other out in that sort of way.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:14:41):**  And so and again, you know, this is different than symbiosis, where plants are specifically  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:14:46):**  evolving a relationship to help each other.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:14:48):**  It's a different sort of thing.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:14:50):**  That's not the same kind of companionship, as you might see between mycorrhizal fungi  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:14:55):**  and a plant where they're literally exchanging and they've evolved in symbiosis.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:15:00):**  You know, this is different.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:15:02):**  This is companionship by dynamics and companionship by proximity and companionship by, you know,  
**[0:15:10-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:15:10):**  ecosystem function, you know, so we can do all that on a small on a small thing.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:15:17):**  So you know, the takeaway is, you know, if you're designing a five by five spot or a  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:15:21):**  five by 20 garden bed, you know, pick pick a few key species or one key species that  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:15:27):**  is what you want to grow for a specific reason.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:15:31):**  Make sure it's hardy to your climate, that it'll survive your coldest average temperatures  
**[0:15:36-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:15:36):**  in winter, and that it's suitable to your specific soil, that it is a plant that will  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:15:42):**  work in your specific sun regime, like whether or not you have a full sun partial shade or  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:15:47):**  full shade site.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:15:50):**  And then once you do that, pick your companions first based on their layering and then based  
**[0:15:54-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:15:54):**  on their function.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:15:56):**  And then potential is about understanding where your micro landscape is going and understanding  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:16:06):**  that ecosystems build potential, you know, and sometimes people talk about, oh, well,  
**[0:16:11-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:16:11):**  there's really no such thing as a climax community and ecosystems.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:16:14):**  There's a lot of different theories about this in terms of ecology.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:16:18):**  And when I say ecosystem build potential, I'm not really referring to the fact that  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:16:23):**  like they're going to reach some climax community or that ecosystems necessarily only diversify  
**[0:16:29-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:16:29):**  over time.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:16:30):**  Like this is not a unidirectional thing of constant potential building.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:16:34):**  But this is the fact that if you take a piece of land that's just in lawn and you integrate  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:16:39):**  some fruit trees, let's say you take the, you know, a hedge or a piece of land that  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:16:44):**  could be a hedge at the front of a property that's like, you know, five by 15 feet or  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:16:48):**  20 feet, the front of your average suburban property or something.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:16:52):**  And you have it in just in lawn right now, you know, and you put in a couple of plum  
**[0:16:59-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:16:59):**  trees and a couple of pear trees and, you know, some raspberries and some ground covers.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:17:06):**  Maybe you have in the shady side, you have like some perennial violets or self seeding  
**[0:17:09-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:17:09):**  violets and you have some chives in there and you have a little bit of asparagus and  
**[0:17:12-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:17:12):**  you know, have some different variety in there placed in an organized fashion, but it's diversified.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:17:19):**  You're building potential.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:17:21):**  You're building potential because now you have a lot of different routes that are opening  
**[0:17:25-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:17:25):**  pore space in the soil in different ways.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:17:28):**  That's potential for more air and water cycling and storage.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:17:34):**  You're building macro pore space in your soil, which allows drainage.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:17:38):**  You're building potential for better drainage potential that will be seen in the next big  
**[0:17:42-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:17:42):**  flood year.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:17:44):**  You're building potential for water storage by opening up micro pore space in the soil  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:17:49):**  that allows your soil to drain through the macro pore space, which is replaced by air,  
**[0:17:54-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:17:54):**  but retain water in the micro pore space.  
**[0:17:57-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:17:57):**  So that's building potential for the next drought.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:17:59):**  You're you're you're you're yielding diversified leaf litter and twigs and root sheddings and  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:18:08):**  bark sheddings and rotten material and you're building the potential of soil organic matter.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:18:14):**  You're increasing soil organic matter and you're building, you know, even if it doesn't  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:18:19):**  build it in some years or, you know, maybe it's been burned up faster, but you have the  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:18:24):**  potential for it.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:18:25):**  Awesome.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:18:26):**  And that takes so much of the guesswork out of planting by working through the form, function  
**[0:18:30-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:18:30):**  and potential metrics that you'd want on your site.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:18:34):**  Now that we have it all planted, let's talk about the ongoing stewardship that these systems  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:18:38):**  need and also how you can use them to inspire others.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:18:43):**  I sort of break down stewardship in this book into three parts.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:18:48):**  And the first is to exemplify, to set an example by growing a garden, planting a fruit tree,  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:18:57):**  set an example of the sort of landscape, the sort of habitat I like to think of it as human  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:19:02):**  habitat really that you want to live in.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:19:06):**  And the second one is mentorship and, you know, that sort of stewardship where you're  
**[0:19:11-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:19:11):**  helping someone else learn how to plant like you did, showing them what you are doing so  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:19:19):**  that they can mimic that success and bring it home into their yard or their community  
**[0:19:24-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:19:24):**  if they're from another community.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:19:26):**  And then the third type of stewardship is sponsorship where you're directly supporting  
**[0:19:31-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:19:31):**  their own stewardship activities.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:19:34):**  And this could be monetary sponsorship or this could be provisioning them with seeds  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:19:38):**  and suckers and scions from your edible ecosystem in your yard.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:19:43):**  And through this stewardship, we can create great change because we can inspire people  
**[0:19:49-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:19:49):**  by the smells and the colors and the taste of our yards and our neighborhood, you know,  
**[0:19:56-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:19:56):**  edible laneways or bike lanes or whatever has been done.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:19:59):**  I mean, we were talking earlier about what does it look like?  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:20:01):**  Well, it looks like, you know, a fruit tree in every yard and maybe the pollinator for  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:20:06):**  your plum is in your neighbor's yard and maybe, you know, the big massive berry patch that  
**[0:20:11-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:20:11):**  everyone harvests berries from is along, you know, the fence line of a football field.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:20:17):**  And in another yard, there's bees, but they're moving throughout the whole neighborhood,  
**[0:20:21-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:20:21):**  pollinating and getting nectar sources.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:20:24):**  So it's in the neighborhoods, this ecosystem, but we create that bigger picture by creating  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:20:29):**  little spots that influence more spots around them.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:20:33):**  You know, any square of lawn that becomes an edible ecosystem that then has the capacity  
**[0:20:37-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:20:37):**  to help influence around it.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:20:39):**  And that's a true community effort, but one where, you know, it's simple in its origin.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:20:45):**  Why not plant a pear tree?  
**[0:20:47-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:20:47):**  I challenge you to plant a fruit tree.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:20:50):**  I challenge you, everyone, to plant one fruit tree and a high impact tree, a tree that's  
**[0:20:58-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:20:58):**  where people live and it's getting some care and not becoming a gardener, not saying I'm  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:21:08):**  going to be on a 100-mile diet and not saying I'm going to only eat from my yard and not  
**[0:21:13-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:21:13):**  saying I'm going to forgo all imported food and I'm going to, you know, but just plant  
**[0:21:20-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:21:20):**  one tree and care for it.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:21:24):**  And for those who don't have access to any land at all, you know, help sponsor them to  
**[0:21:30-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:21:30):**  plant a tree, help organize for community plantings, but take up that call of action  
**[0:21:37-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:21:37):**  that says, you know, every tree counts.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:21:40):**  And with billions of people on this planet, that's billions of high impact trees, not  
**[0:21:47-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:21:47):**  little tiny, you know, saplings planted to reforest, you know, monocultures in the boreal  
**[0:21:55-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:21:55):**  forest for future clear cuts, you know, and not little tiny trees planted in the tropics  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:22:01):**  or other areas as part of a, you know, a carbon credit, you know, concept.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:22:07):**  But plant a tree that will produce fruits or nuts or a berry bush or, you know, herbs  
**[0:22:13-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:22:13):**  or a five by five micro edible ecosystem in your yard, in a city park, along a bike lane,  
**[0:22:21-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:22:21):**  as a spot along a hedge on a farm, you know, on your land or a neighbor's or a friend's  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:22:27):**  or community land, but everybody can either physically do this or help sponsor for those  
**[0:22:33-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:22:33):**  who can't.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:22:34):**  And this is big change.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:22:36):**  This is big change.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:22:37):**  This is a lot of fruit.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:22:39):**  And then we become less dependent on these corporations and these imports and this whole  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:22:42):**  system that we can't even really fathom because we're starting to build real food security  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:22:47):**  right where we live, you know, and so whatever the reason is, you know, are you, are you  
**[0:22:53-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:22:53):**  doing it because you think it's cool because you want the fruit because you're a diehard  
**[0:22:57-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:22:57):**  environmentalist because you're a nerdy scientist because you're into outdoor education because  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:23:03):**  you just like getting muddy.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:23:05):**  I do, you know, but just plant a tree, you know, and, and help people plant trees and  
**[0:23:12-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:23:12):**  make it a high impact tree.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:23:14):**  That's massive results.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:23:16):**  And a single pear tree is able to, you know, yield hundreds of twigs that can be cut as  
**[0:23:21-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:23:21):**  scion would to make more pear trees.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:23:25):**  That's massive potential.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:23:27):**  Now that's hundreds of pear trees that can grow to produce 300 pounds of fruit each.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:23:32):**  That is massive potential.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:23:33):**  And it goes right in hand with one of the concepts that I've known for a long time,  
**[0:23:37-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:23:37):**  even working with larger ecosystems, is that small spaces are not only easier to manage,  
**[0:23:43-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:23:43):**  but easier to manage intensively.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:23:45):**  You can grow so much in a small, highly cultivated and stewarded piece of land in comparison  
**[0:23:51-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:23:51):**  to what you could do in broad acreage when you can't give the same amount of attention  
**[0:23:56-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:23:56):**  and care that you would to a smaller plot.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:23:59):**  I really hope that this episode has inspired you to look at the small and underutilized  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:24:03):**  spaces around your own home and in your own community in a different way, and hopefully  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:24:08):**  even get out there and plant something or support someone who is starting to plant an  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:24:12):**  edible ecosystem right where you live.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-create-an-edible-ecosystem/#t=0:24:16):**  That's our show for this week.

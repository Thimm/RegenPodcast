### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 19 Aug 2022 08:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:00:00):**  This is Regenerative Skills, the podcast helping you to learn the skills and solutions to create  
**[0:00:08-0:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:00:08):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:00:10):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:00:14):**  I don't know about you, but even though there's unlimited information available online, I  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:00:19):**  tend to learn best by doing things and actually getting my hands dirty.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:00:23):**  If you're interested in making the leap from screens to the land, then I've got some exciting  
**[0:00:27-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:00:27):**  learning events for you.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:00:29):**  I'm going to be teaching two of my favorite subjects this upcoming autumn at the Green  
**[0:00:33-0:00:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:00:33):**  Rebel Farm in beautiful Miravet, Spain.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:00:36):**  The first course is a weekend intensive on regenerative agroforestry, designed for people  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:00:41):**  who want to try their hands at a range of different tree planting and orchard maintenance  
**[0:00:45-0:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:00:45):**  skills.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:00:46):**  We'll cover the whole range from reading a landscape and propagating plants, to planning  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:00:50):**  a planting project, getting trees in the ground, maintaining a growing system, and even pruning  
**[0:00:55-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:00:55):**  a grown forest.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:00:56):**  The best part is that all of these are based on activities to advance a real farm.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:01):**  The second event is a 5-day deep dive into the regenerative design process, again with  
**[0:01:06-0:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:06):**  a focus on agroforestry.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:08):**  This course is designed for people who are either considering buying land, or who are  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:12):**  at the early stages of developing a site and want to ensure that they get off on a profitable  
**[0:01:16-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:16):**  regenerative trajectory.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:18):**  We'll work through the scale of permanence learning to gather essential information about  
**[0:01:22-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:22):**  the landscape, vegetation, and soil.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:25):**  From there, we'll work through hydrological capture and restoration, planning for productive  
**[0:01:29-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:29):**  planting and reforestation, business considerations, soil health regeneration, and much more.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:36):**  All of this too will be taught through hands-on activities so you leave not only knowing how  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:40):**  to develop an effective and profitable design, but also with experience with the work and  
**[0:01:45-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:45):**  skills required to get things done.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:48):**  This weekend agroforestry intensive will be from Friday the 16th through Sunday the 18th  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:52):**  of September, and the design workshop goes from Tuesday the 11th to Sunday the 16th of  
**[0:01:57-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:57):**  October.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:01:58):**  So don't start your project with digital learning alone, come and get your hands dirty  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:02):**  with inspiring, like-minded people and level up your skills this autumn.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:06):**  You can learn more by clicking at the link at RegenerativeSkills.com or on the link tree  
**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:11):**  in the bio on our Instagram.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:13):**  Early bird discounts are now open, so don't hesitate, and I'll see you in the orchard  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:16):**  soon!  
**[0:02:17-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:17):**  Hey everybody, and welcome back!  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:20):**  Now I've been taking it a little bit easy, since my sister and her little girls are overvisiting  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:25):**  from Kuwait for the month, and my granny on the Isle of Man was also able to stop by for  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:30):**  a week, so for that reason I'm going to rebroadcast one of my favorite episodes on  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:34):**  agroforestry from two seasons ago with Patrick Worms.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:39):**  I hope all of you out there are also finding time to unwind and enjoy this summer despite  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:43):**  all the challenges and extremes we're experiencing.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:48):**  With regenerative agriculture and agroforestry increasingly becoming popular topics in environmental  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:53):**  and even political circles, I wanted to do a one-on-one session with one of my favorite  
**[0:02:57-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:02:57):**  speakers in this sphere, Patrick Worms.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:00):**  Now many of you frequent listeners will remember him from the panel discussion on agroforestry  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:05):**  two weeks ago that I hosted with climate farmers.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:08):**  I got to know Patrick's work and perspective more intimately as part of the online course  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:13):**  on ecosystem restoration design that we both teach on.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:17):**  Patrick is the Senior Science Policy Advisor at World Agroforestry, President of the European  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:22):**  Agroforestry Federation, and Trustee on the International Union of Agroforestry.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:28):**  He's also a valued member of the Advisory Council with the Ecosystem Restoration Camps.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:34):**  Now in the courses and conversations that I've seen with him, I've always been struck  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:37):**  by the stories and compassionate understanding of the people that Patrick has met in his  
**[0:03:41-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:41):**  work and his travels.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:44):**  In order to make some of these stories and insights available to you listeners, I let  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:48):**  go of the usual focus on just actionable information to let this chat take its own course.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:53):**  Though we still cover a lot of practical advice in this talk, what I often take away from  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:03:57):**  listening to Patrick is a renewed reverence for the individual people who are working  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:01):**  to manage their lands and produce food all around the world.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:05):**  It's easy to think of agriculture and the food industry as these monoliths without faces,  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:10):**  but the lives of the people who make up these systems, from those who tend the land all  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:14):**  the way through the logistics, distribution, transportation, and all the way to our kitchens,  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:19):**  are important to remember and pay attention to as well.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:23):**  To get us started off with some background though, Patrick shed some light on the history  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:27):**  of agroforestry and its deep traditions in Europe specifically.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:31):**  You know when you're on a spaceship and it's a long way away and you take a picture back  
**[0:04:35-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:35):**  of Earth and you see this little blue marble next to the sun, that's the scale at which  
**[0:04:41-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:41):**  agroforestry can happen, right?  
**[0:04:43-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:43):**  We have examples of agroforestry from the Arctic region right next to the tundra.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:52):**  It's reindeer herding, it's a classical silver pastoral system, it's been going for centuries,  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:56):**  and it's working well.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:04:58):**  Archaeology is now showing us examples of agroforestry systems that were maintaining  
**[0:05:01-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:01):**  extremely high population densities in places as different as the Southwestern Amazon or  
**[0:05:07-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:07):**  the Papuan Highlands, and that were doing so anywhere between 5 and 12,000 years ago.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:14):**  The old story we all heard at school that agriculture started 7,000 years ago when people  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:18):**  domesticated some grasses in the Middle East and then spread around the world, it's just  
**[0:05:23-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:23):**  a tiny part of what history and the history of agriculture actually reveals.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:29):**  Thousands of plants and animals were domesticated around the world in hundreds of different  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:33):**  locations over timescales that took millennia and started about 12,000 years ago.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:39):**  So it's an absolutely extraordinary story and the reason we're only just beginning to  
**[0:05:42-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:42):**  discover it is because not every civilization had the good idea of building a great big  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:48):**  fat pyramid there so that we knew that something happened.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:51):**  Most of these things were disappeared in the landscape.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:55):**  Think of the Amazon for example, there's no stone there, there's only wood.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:05:58):**  So even if you build a massive structure out of wood 5,000 years ago, the likelihood that  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:03):**  anything would be left 5,000 years down the road for an archaeologist to find its nail.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:08):**  So it took the more sophisticated technologies we have today to begin to discover that.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:12):**  Now let's zoom back from this deep history to today and from this whole globe to Europe.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:20):**  Agroforestry was a traditional farming practice across Europe as well, especially before the  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:25):**  19th century, i.e. before we started having external inputs and mechanization.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:30):**  It was simply the way things were done, in particular for grazing systems.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:34):**  The idea that a grazing system is a pasture that is empty of trees and shrubs is a modern  
**[0:06:38-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:38):**  one.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:39):**  Traditional grazing systems around the world tended to include trees and shrubs all the  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:43):**  time, not only because of the ecosystem services that these trees and shrubs provide to the  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:47):**  grasses, but also because they themselves provide nutrition and micronutrients to your  
**[0:06:53-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:53):**  livestock in ways that the grasses don't always do.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:06:56):**  And it's not that people were using words like micronutrients to describe why they had  
**[0:07:03-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:03):**  these trees or their shrubs in their fields, of course.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:05):**  Those are modern words we use to describe the mechanics of the science underpinning  
**[0:07:10-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:10):**  these management practices, but these management practices evolved through trial and error  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:14):**  over time, and were extremely successful.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:18):**  By extremely successful, I mean they fed our cities during the Industrial Revolution.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:23):**  They fed our armies, which proceeded to colonize the world.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:27):**  They were successful agricultural systems.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:30):**  The result of that productivity was not always used for good things.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:36):**  I'm only thinking of Nazism or Fascism or Communism or Stalinism or colonialism here,  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:44):**  but it was fueled by this agricultural productivity.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:49):**  And today, again, we find that agroforestry is coming back to the fore.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:07:55):**  And the reason for that is because we're beginning to realize the limitations of the wonderful  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:01):**  suite of modern agricultural technologies we started deploying at scale after the First  
**[0:08:06-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:06):**  World War.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:07):**  Fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, irrigation, tractors, pumps, other forms of machinery,  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:15):**  all those things very rapidly made the life of farmers a lot easier, but the limits are  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:20):**  becoming obvious to all, and that's why we're having this conversation.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:23):**  And it turns out that you can replace a lot of these things simply by managing your landscape  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:27):**  a little bit differently, and the first thing you can do in order to manage that landscape  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:31):**  differently is to begin to add trees back into a landscape where the trees have been  
**[0:08:36-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:36):**  taken out.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:37):**  So there's a lot of criticism and perhaps analysis of trees being integrated back into  
**[0:08:44-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:44):**  annual-based agricultural systems and saying that it'll take away from the amount of land  
**[0:08:50-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:50):**  able to be productive, and it could get in the way of the efficiency of the systems that  
**[0:08:56-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:08:56):**  use large machinery and chemical inputs in order to dominate an entire ecosystem for  
**[0:09:03-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:03):**  a single crop perhaps.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:05):**  But we both know that it's not necessary to farm that way, and in fact, it's a very small  
**[0:09:11-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:11):**  percent of farming that is run that way which actually contributes to the global food supply.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:17):**  Well, there is that, but I'd like to get back just to the way you phrased this question.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:22):**  There's less land available for crops.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:24):**  It is less efficient.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:26):**  By using these words, you've already decided that the only way to farm is in large monocrops.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:33):**  Any farmer that thinks along these ways is the farmer that will eventually go bankrupt,  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:40):**  because the thing that matters to a farmer is not the efficiency of production, and it's  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:45):**  not the yield, and it's not the amount of land that is under a particular crop.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:49):**  The thing that matters to a farmer is how much money is in the bank after he's paid  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:53):**  all his costs and sold all his products.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:09:57):**  And it turns out that time and time again, this resource-intensive industrial farming  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:05):**  systems that have become prevalent across Europe are not very profitable.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:09):**  They only work at very large scales, which is why family farms are disappearing, which  
**[0:10:13-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:13):**  is why small farms are disappearing.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:16):**  And because they only work at very large scales, they are destroying local communities, because  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:21):**  they are efficient enough so that you need one unit of labor in some of the most productive  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:26):**  areas of Europe per 250 hectares of land.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:30):**  That means that the population density across the landscape is so low that there are no  
**[0:10:34-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:34):**  villages anymore.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:35):**  There are no shops.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:36):**  There are no churches.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:37):**  There are no schools.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:38):**  There are no cafes.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:39):**  There is nothing, which means that no young person wants to farm there, which means that  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:43):**  as the old farmers die out, the land is taken over by people who are doing corporate farming.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:48):**  And corporate farmers, they don't care about the social network.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:51):**  All they care about is reducing their costs and employing cheap labor and replacing that  
**[0:10:57-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:10:57):**  cheap labor, because it's still more expensive than machinery, with machinery and inputs  
**[0:11:00-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:00):**  wherever they can.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:01):**  So at very large scale, it works.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:03):**  You can make money in that way.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:04):**  But at any scale but the very large one, you cannot.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:07):**  However, if you focus on profit, if you focus on reducing your costs, if you focus on the  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:13):**  difference between what you pay and what you get, then it is extremely possible to be a  
**[0:11:19-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:19):**  family farmer on 10 or 20 or 30 or 100 or 150 hectares and still make a decent living.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:26):**  So don't focus on the yield.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:28):**  Don't focus on the efficiency.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:29):**  Don't focus on the amount of land under your monocrop.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:32):**  Focus on how much money you're making.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:34):**  And once you focus on how much money you're making, you'll start tinkering with the system,  
**[0:11:38-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:38):**  because you realize that diesel is bloody expensive.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:41):**  So why do you want to plow that deep soil every year, right?  
**[0:11:44-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:44):**  You will realize that herbicides are expensive, pesticides are expensive, fertilizers are  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:48):**  expensive, irrigation is expensive.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:50):**  Everything is a cost.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:51):**  And you will try to cut down on some of them, because some of these services will be replaced  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:56):**  by trees.  
**[0:11:57-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:57):**  Some of these services will be replaced by no-till.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:11:59):**  Some of these services will be replaced by cover crops.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:01):**  Some of these services will be replaced by other kinds of trees.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:04):**  Some of these services will be replaced by direct seeding into a cover crop, etc., etc.,  
**[0:12:09-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:09):**  etc.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:10):**  And you start experimenting.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:11):**  And as you start experimenting, some things will work and some things will not work.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:13):**  But you'll keep the things that work and your profitability is just going to go up year  
**[0:12:19-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:19):**  after year after year after year.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:21):**  And eventually, you're just not going to have to go to the bank any longer, except to check  
**[0:12:27-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:27):**  how much money you've got.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:29):**  You certainly don't need to ever again have that really difficult conversation about borrowing  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:34):**  yet more money to try to keep a failing business afloat.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:38):**  Can you explain that a little further about how farmers have been incentivized to manage  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:42):**  their production systems in a way that is not congruent with their own profitability?  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:48):**  The objective has always got to be the fundamental objective.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:51):**  Farm is a business.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:52):**  The fundamental objective of any farm has got to be to make a profit.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:12:56):**  And if your goal is not to increase your profit margin, then you've got the wrong goal.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:01):**  And in farming, industry has convinced farmers that the only goal that matters is yield and  
**[0:13:06-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:06):**  efficiency.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:07):**  That's great for industry, but it's a disaster for farmers.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:11):**  I see that everywhere.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:12):**  Here, I have a friend in Belgium.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:14):**  I'm in Belgium.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:15):**  I have a friend in the Belgian Ardennes who is doing regenerative grazing.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:18):**  And he started 10 years ago with 6,000 euros in his pocket.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:21):**  He's now the most profitable beef grower in his region.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:24):**  All around, people are intensively growing this monstrosity called the Blain Bleu Belgé.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:31):**  It's a breed whose muscles are so hypertrophied that it cannot give birth naturally anymore.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:39):**  The cows need to be born by caesarean section.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:42):**  And at the bar on a Friday evening, what the farmers are talking about is how they manage  
**[0:13:48-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:48):**  to put another three pounds onto the maximum carcass weight of their cow, of this particular  
**[0:13:56-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:56):**  cow.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:13:57):**  How they bred him to be a little bit heavier still.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:00):**  And they're drowning in debt.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:02):**  Because it's an extremely expensive, very, very input-demanding management system.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:08):**  Just imagine your cows are so fragile.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:14):**  A caesarean section for every calf.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:19):**  It's madness.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:20):**  But they are convinced that this is the way of farming.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:22):**  And to begin with, my friend who was doing the regenerative grazing was actually attacked  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:26):**  in the street, not physically, but shouted at in the street by people who said there  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:30):**  was this disgusting, he was putting trees back in his fields and, you know, their grandfathers  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:34):**  had broken their backs to pull all these trees out.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:38):**  And there he was putting them back and damaging these fields again.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:42):**  That was 10 years ago.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:43):**  Now they come to ask him for advice.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:46):**  Tell me some other stories that you've got from the practitioners that you've worked  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:49):**  with and you've helped to guide into systems that work for their context.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:54):**  Because it really is specific to where everybody is, what their personal goals on their land  
**[0:14:58-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:58):**  are.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:14:59):**  And I know this much better than I do, that there is no one-size-fits-all prescription  
**[0:15:04-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:04):**  for how agroforestry can work on a site.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:07):**  There is one.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:09):**  There is one prescription.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:11):**  Be a geek.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:14):**  The farmers who are geeks always make it.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:18):**  And sometimes the geeks have to hide themselves.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:21):**  I'm thinking back to this woman I met in the Ruanzori Mountains.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:26):**  It's a mountain range that's in the humid tropic bits of Uganda and forms the boundary  
**[0:15:31-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:31):**  to the Democratic Republic of Congo.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:34):**  And there the farmers of the village who grows a lot of coffee had received three years previously  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:43):**  better coffee stock, better banana stock, better cassava stock, so better genetics,  
**[0:15:49-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:49):**  and a little bit of agronomic advice.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:51):**  Get there three years later, I look around, and most of the coffee bushes are like this  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:55):**  high and the leaves are a bit yellow and there's not many cherries on them.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:15:59):**  And the cassava's okay, but the bananas are not doing great either, and the people are  
**[0:16:02-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:02):**  obviously poor.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:03):**  And then I see over there a place that's full of trees.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:07):**  And I ask them, oh, is that the graveyard?  
**[0:16:10-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:10):**  Because in Africa, usually the only place that has lots of trees is the graveyard, because  
**[0:16:13-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:13):**  that's the one place you don't go and cut the trees down in, because people might get  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:17):**  angry.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:19):**  The dead might get angry.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:22):**  So they said, no, no, that's a farm that belongs to this lady.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:24):**  So I walk over there, and indeed it's a farm.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:26):**  I walk in there, so lots of shade trees and coffee trees, boom, three meters high, overloaded  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:34):**  with cherries, same genetics, planted at the same time.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:39):**  And the soil was black, there were chickens running around, there were lots of cover crops,  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:43):**  there were lianas growing along the trees, there was a variety of different trees, including  
**[0:16:47-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:47):**  those coffees, those cassava, and that banana, but a lot more than that.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:50):**  And then this lady comes to me.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:53):**  And she's shy, she's looking down at the ground.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:55):**  But she's obviously not poor.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:16:57):**  She's dressed in new clothes, and she's fat, when everybody else there is kind of scrawny,  
**[0:17:02-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:02):**  right?  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:03):**  And I start asking her a question, and she's just shy, she looks down on the ground.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:08):**  It took a while to get the story out of her.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:10):**  You know why she was shy?  
**[0:17:11-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:11):**  Because she was ashamed.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:12):**  And you know why she was ashamed?  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:15):**  Because she totally ignored what the agronomist said three years previously.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:19):**  She farmed the way her grandmother had taught her to farm.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:24):**  And so I start asking questions, why is nobody else doing what she's doing?  
**[0:17:28-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:28):**  It's obviously working so well, right?  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:30):**  And I hear, well, she's a sorceress.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:35):**  Or the story once I heard is, well, she had the help of a white man.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:40):**  What's the story there?  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:41):**  Well, it turned out that a few years previously, like five or six years previously, some hippie  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:46):**  kid with a backpack came through the village and stayed with her.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:50):**  And apparently he was an agro, he was a permaculture geek.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:53):**  And he shared some of this permaculture knowledge with this woman who was already farming quite  
**[0:17:57-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:57):**  well.  
**[0:17:58-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:58):**  And this woman was obviously a geek, right?  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:17:59):**  She picked it all up, she integrated it into her farm, and her farm was amazingly productive.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:04):**  But she was ashamed, because she was not doing what the university-educated outsider had  
**[0:18:09-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:09):**  told her she should do.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:12):**  And what do you say to farmers who, I mean, I've gone and talked to certain people and  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:17):**  even introduced the ideas of not tilling the soil and gotten responses like, well, this  
**[0:18:22-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:22):**  is how we've always done it.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:23):**  This is how my father or my grandfather does it.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:25):**  This is a part of our culture, and it's always been done this way.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:28):**  Why would I change that now?  
**[0:18:29-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:29):**  What do you say to that?  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:32):**  Nothing.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:33):**  I sympathize.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:36):**  I sympathize because I have, that reminds me of the story of a friend of mine, Indiana.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:44):**  Two brothers, one stayed on the land, one went off to the city.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:48):**  The one who went off to the city made a little bit of money and learned about, you know,  
**[0:18:52-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:52):**  was always interested but learned about regenerative agriculture and decided to go back to the  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:18:58):**  land and pick up his part of the inheritance that was managed by his own brother to do  
**[0:19:03-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:03):**  his own stuff on it.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:05):**  His brother, meanwhile, had stayed on that land and for 30 years had farmed that land  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:09):**  using the best advice that agro-industry gave him.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:14):**  Ever bigger, ever more, more, more inputs, better seeds, better, better everything.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:21):**  The poor man was working 18-hour days, seven days a week with a day off for Christmas if  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:26):**  he was lucky, and he was still drowning in debt.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:30):**  Then his brother comes back from the city, takes over half the land and does regenerative  
**[0:19:34-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:34):**  grazing.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:35):**  He's working maybe three, four hours a day and he has no debt and he's making money.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:40):**  You know that almost broke that family because the brother who stayed on the land, who was  
**[0:19:48-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:48):**  in his 50s by then, who had spent his entire life running around, in effect being exploited,  
**[0:19:57-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:19:57):**  worse than a slave, suddenly had to realize that he had wasted his life, that he'd been  
**[0:20:03-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:03):**  sold a bill of goods, that everything he had done and believed in and worked so hard for,  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:11):**  the only thing he could show for it was poisoned soil and a big mountain of debt.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:16):**  Just imagine what that does to your head.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:17):**  I mean, you are still a young man, Oliver, but just imagine, I'm the age of that guy,  
**[0:20:22-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:22):**  just imagine what it does to your head to realize that you have worked harder than anybody  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:28):**  else you know to pour your life down the drain.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:32):**  It's so hard.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:34):**  That's why when somebody tells me that this is the way we've always done it and I intend,  
**[0:20:39-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:39):**  fine, continue.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:40):**  It's your life, it's your farm.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:42):**  You do it the way you want.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:44):**  You know, it has to be the next generation sometimes.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:47):**  It doesn't always have to be the existing farmers.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:49):**  And in Europe, of course, that's a problem because the average age of farmers is what,  
**[0:20:52-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:52):**  56 or 57 or whatever it is now, old.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:56):**  That's the average.  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:57):**  Yeah, even higher in the States.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:20:58):**  I think it's getting up in the 60s.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:01):**  Right.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:03):**  Which means it's, of course, you're not going to change.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:05):**  You know, I mean, at my age, you don't learn foreign languages anymore, right?  
**[0:21:11-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:11):**  You are set in your ways.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:13):**  And you've acquired a certain expertise and people who've done industrial farming for  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:18):**  30 years and are still in that business have not yet been pushed off the land.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:23):**  They have acquired a certain expertise on how to farm that way.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:28):**  You know, you and I know that that expertise is a voix sans-d'issou.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:33):**  You can't, you know, it doesn't lead anywhere.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:35):**  And that eventually farming has to change and that their sons and daughters will have  
**[0:21:39-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:39):**  to do things differently.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:41):**  But if they don't want to change, I'm in no position to tell them that they have to.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:46):**  I want to take a minute to point out how important this reflection is.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:50):**  I myself work in restoration design and regenerative agriculture consulting, and I'm increasingly  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:21:55):**  seeing things like YouTube videos, Netflix documentaries, and blog articles from peers  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:00):**  and others involved in this type of work that are pressing a message that we need to transform  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:04):**  the food and health system all the time, especially at the farming level.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:09):**  Like I mentioned in the beginning, it's a very popular subject right now.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:13):**  And while I, of course, advocate for more ecological production methods, and I agree  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:17):**  with a lot of the change that is needed in these industries, I'm increasingly left with  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:21):**  a feeling from some of those prominent voices that it's so simple to make a change that,  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:26):**  if it weren't for negligence or for ignorance or even some bad actors in the field sometimes,  
**[0:22:32-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:32):**  that we'd be able to turn this all around overnight.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:35):**  It often comes off to me as a little bit pretentious and pious, especially when it comes from people  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:40):**  who've never worked directly in agriculture and only know about it from what they hear  
**[0:22:44-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:44):**  from the outside.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:46):**  For this and many other reasons, I'm careful not to single people out and try to talk about  
**[0:22:51-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:51):**  farmers as if they were a single demographic.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:54):**  The idea that we know more or know better how to run a farm or other ag business from  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:22:58):**  the outside perspective, when we're just armed with some catchy Instagram slogan about sequestering  
**[0:23:03-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:03):**  carbon in soils, to me is representative of the presumptions and the old paradigm of tackling  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:09):**  problems that I really hope this movement can move away from, because it serves to alienate  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:13):**  us from the people that we hope to support and can make communication between multiple  
**[0:23:18-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:18):**  sides that much harder.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:20):**  I genuinely believe that we're all doing the best that we can with the knowledge, experience,  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:26):**  and influences and resources that we've been given, and for any of us to push our ideas  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:31):**  on others without taking the time to understand how someone arrived at the conclusions and  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:36):**  the viewpoints that they have is not indicative of the compassion and the humanity that I  
**[0:23:40-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:40):**  would hope to aspire to personally.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:43):**  So let's now talk about what transition to regenerative agroforestry looks like coming  
**[0:23:48-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:48):**  from a common industrial model, because we can analyze the efficacy of any given method  
**[0:23:53-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:53):**  or practice on its own, but transition takes time, especially in risk adverse business  
**[0:23:59-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:23:59):**  models like farming.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:01):**  So how might this play out?  
**[0:24:03-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:03):**  Let's take a very common farming system.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:07):**  Let's suppose it's an arable system and, you know, let's say wheat.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:13):**  It's a wheat arable system.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:15):**  Wheat is a winter crop.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:18):**  So you're typically sowing your crop in the late summer and you're harvesting in the fall  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:29):**  and you're harvesting in the early summer too.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:33):**  And then what you have is a system where the most light intensive part of the year, your  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:42):**  land is more or less bare.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:44):**  So already for that reason, you have a strong interest in using a cover crop, because that  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:50):**  cover crop is going to grow and produce green manure and hold your soil in place when the  
**[0:24:56-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:24:56):**  summer storms come while your main crop is not growing.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:02):**  Simply by having that, you're already going to see that certain things are going to happen.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:06):**  You're going to need less fertilizer and you might have, you might notice that you need  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:12):**  fewer fungicides, that your need for those products is simply going down because you  
**[0:25:18-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:18):**  have begun to rekindle some ecosystemic processes.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:21):**  You also have the pleasure of seeing that less soil is running off your land into the  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:27):**  ditch or the road when a storm comes than your neighbors, simply because you have that  
**[0:25:31-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:31):**  cover crop in place.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:32):**  Now once you have that, that's money in the bank.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:36):**  You need to buy less fertilizer, you need to buy fewer fungicides, you need less diesel  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:41):**  because you don't need to go around so often with your sprayer, and you're keeping your  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:45):**  capital base because your soil is not running away.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:47):**  You can notice that and you'll see the financial results of that fairly rapidly within the  
**[0:25:52-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:52):**  first season you're going to see the financial results of that.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:54):**  It's not going to be massive, it's not going to trouble your income, but it's going to  
**[0:25:56-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:56):**  be measurable, it's going to be visible.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:25:58):**  Then you can move on, you can move to the next stage.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:01):**  Then why kill your cover crop with a glyphosate before you put your seed down?  
**[0:26:07-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:07):**  Why not do direct seeding after having gone through with a crush up?  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:10):**  You also save some diesel there because you can have the crusher in front and the seeder  
**[0:26:13-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:13):**  in the back, and so you only need to go through the field once as opposed to going through  
**[0:26:16-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:16):**  the field several times.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:19):**  The crusher produces a wonderful green manure that sits right on top of the soil and prevents  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:24):**  that soil from drying out when there was a little bit of a late summer drought.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:29):**  You suddenly have other advantages that are coming up, right?  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:34):**  Again, then you notice that the wind is always coming from the west and because of the orientation  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:39):**  of your field, that wind is always desiccating the crop at the wrong time.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:44):**  Well, put some trees down, put a windbreak down there.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:49):**  And if you choose a species well, that windbreak is going to make you money when you harvest  
**[0:26:53-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:53):**  it 20 years down the road.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:26:55):**  And again, you're going to begin to see other benefits, right?  
**[0:27:00-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:00):**  And once you start down that particular thread mill, you see your revenues go up and you  
**[0:27:03-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:03):**  see your costs go down, then you become really interested and you start doing something else.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:09):**  You know, more mixes in your cover crops.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:14):**  Planting it straight into a living understory rather than crushing it first.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:19):**  Putting alleys of trees down there, putting alleys of small fruit in the middle of the  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:23):**  alleys of trees, beginning to understand how to bring animal manure in.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:27):**  And before you know it, you're having fun because you're managing an extremely complex  
**[0:27:31-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:31):**  farming system with lots and lots of different products, some of which will fail, some of  
**[0:27:36-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:36):**  which won't, but all of which will mean that you can afford the failure, which before that  
**[0:27:42-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:42):**  you couldn't do.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:43):**  Before that, when you only had one crop, if that one crop failed, it was a bloody catastrophe.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:48):**  Now when you have a number of different things happening on that land, when one bit of the  
**[0:27:52-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:52):**  system is operating as well, the other bits of the system will operate well.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:27:56):**  And all together, the productivity of that piece of land, the financial productivity,  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:00):**  the profit and loss, it's going to be better than before.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:04):**  At this point, you must be, at least if not overwhelmed, somewhat discouraged by this  
**[0:28:09-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:09):**  breaking down at the final stage.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:12):**  Can you tell me about some of the things that really give you hope at this point?  
**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:15):**  No, no, not yet.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:17):**  Well you give me hope.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:18):**  The fact that the climate farmers exist give me hope.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:21):**  The fact that the whole idea of regenerative farming, which was simply not an issue ten  
**[0:28:27-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:27):**  years ago, is now dominating some discourses, the fact that the Standard Farming magazine  
**[0:28:37-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:37):**  by the National Farmers Union in the UK now has at least one decent article about soils  
**[0:28:44-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:44):**  in every single issue, all that gives me hope, right?  
**[0:28:49-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:49):**  Because this is not something, it's not about being an activist or being a militant.  
**[0:28:56-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:56):**  It's simply about reality.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:28:58):**  And the reality is, here is a wonderful tool, it's called Agro-Eco Systems, and use that  
**[0:29:03-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:03):**  tool to make your farming system more efficient.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:06):**  And after that, you should continue using whatever chemicals you think you need to use,  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:10):**  that we all know over time that demand for those is going to go down from your particular  
**[0:29:15-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:15):**  farm because your farm is going to be better run.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:18):**  Let your inner geek go free.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:20):**  That gives me hope.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:22):**  What also gives me hope, interestingly enough, is the fact that some of the large corporate  
**[0:29:25-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:25):**  players are now investing serious money in trying to figure out how they set their scale.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:36):**  Because right now they're doing it mostly because of their need for corporate social  
**[0:29:44-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:44):**  responsibility brownie points, but they'd really quite like to figure out a way of doing  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:50):**  it at scale without destroying their business model.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:29:55):**  Now, how quickly will they get there on their own through a market-driven mechanisms?  
**[0:30:03-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:03):**  I am not that optimistic that they can, which is why I'm a strong, unlike most Americans,  
**[0:30:09-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:09):**  I'm a very strong believer in regulations, right?  
**[0:30:11-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:11):**  Level playing field.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:13):**  But the fence around that level playing field is regulation and it has to be properly designed  
**[0:30:17-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:17):**  by politicians using not only the input of people who understand what they understand  
**[0:30:23-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:23):**  from a dispassionate scientific perspective, but also people understand what they understand  
**[0:30:27-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:27):**  because somebody's paying the piper.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:30):**  And that I'm afraid we'll never get out of.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:33):**  It's a debate that's old.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:35):**  Plato was already pointing out 2,500 years ago how dangerous democracy was and how the  
**[0:30:39-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:39):**  best rule was a rule by experts.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:41):**  And that's what we have.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:42):**  European commissioners are ruled by experts, right?  
**[0:30:44-0:30:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:44):**  But we also know what the issues with that can be, which is why we always get back to  
**[0:30:50-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:50):**  the sausage factory.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:51):**  I hope this episode today has helped to broaden your understanding of agroforestry and the  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:55):**  stories from people involved at the ground level.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:30:59):**  Just like every week, I want to pose a couple of questions to you listeners.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:31:03):**  What tree and perennial food growing traditions are there in your part of the world?  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:31:08):**  And how far back can you look to find models of mixed agroforestry in your climate and  
**[0:31:12-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:31:12):**  your culture?  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:31:14):**  There are so many rich cultures and traditions that have been linked to forest food production  
**[0:31:19-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:31:19):**  and I'm only starting to uncover the wisdom and insights in their different expressions  
**[0:31:22-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/patrick-worms-on-the-history-and-future-of-agroforestry/#t=0:31:22):**  around the world.

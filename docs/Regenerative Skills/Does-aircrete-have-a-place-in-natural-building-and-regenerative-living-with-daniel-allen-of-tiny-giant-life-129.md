**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:00:13):**  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:00:25):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this  
**[0:00:29-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:00:29):**  next episode, so let's jump right in.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:00:59):**  Until getting to know Daniel and his understanding of building design and healthy living, I wasn't  
**[0:01:22-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:01:22):**  sure that I wanted to do an episode on Air Creek.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:01:25):**  I've focused only on natural building techniques and materials up until this point because  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:01:29):**  I honestly believe that nature provides all the materials we need to build high quality  
**[0:01:33-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:01:33):**  and healthy structures.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:01:35):**  But since Daniel comes from the perspective of natural building experience and because  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:01:38):**  I like to remain open to new ideas and not become too much of a purist or a zealot for  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:01:43):**  one way of seeing things, I spoke to him about his increasingly popular way of building.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:01:48):**  In this episode, Daniel explains what Air Creek is and how it differs from traditional  
**[0:01:52-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:01:52):**  concrete.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:01:53):**  He walks me through the necessary tools and materials all the way to pouring forms, bricks,  
**[0:01:58-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:01:58):**  mortars, and final coverings.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:02:00):**  We talk about the advantages and disadvantages not only of the construction process, but  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:02:04):**  also of using industrial materials over natural ones and why someone might choose to throw  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:02:09):**  up a quick and durable industrial structure as a stepping stone towards a longer vision  
**[0:02:14-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:02:14):**  for a regenerative lifestyle.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:02:16):**  Just as importantly, Daniel and I go back and forth over the complex issues around the  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:02:20):**  consumption and waste associated with different building methods and also the fact that a  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:02:24):**  regenerative life is different for every person and every place based on their unique context.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:02:30):**  I really enjoyed this discussion and exploring some difficult concepts with Daniel, but even  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:02:35):**  more I would love to hear from you.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:02:37):**  Yes, you about what your personal lines of acceptability in building materials and industrial  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:02:43):**  processes are and what your own definition of regenerative living is.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:02:48):**  What are the hard lines that you draw, if any, and what are the permissible consumptions  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:02:53):**  or waste that you feel alright with given that the world we live in demands it.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:02:58):**  You can leave a comment below the show notes on the website at AbundantEdge.com or email  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:03:02):**  me directly at info at AbundantEdge.com.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:03:06):**  With that said, I'll turn things over now to Daniel.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:03:09):**  Hey Daniel, thanks so much for making time to be with me today.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:03:12):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:03:13-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:03:13):**  Oh, I'm doing great.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:03:15):**  Thank you so much for having me.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:03:16):**  Hey, it's my pleasure.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:03:18):**  I appreciate you reaching out and I'm really excited to talk to you today about AirCrete.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:03:22):**  So what do you say we just jump right in?  
**[0:03:25-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:03:25):**  Oh, absolutely.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:03:26):**  So I guess I'll start with what AirCrete is, right?  
**[0:03:29-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:03:29):**  Sure.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:03:30):**  Actually, before we do that, if you could give us a little about your personal background  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:03:34):**  and what interested you in construction to begin with and what got you interested in  
**[0:03:38-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:03:38):**  AirCrete eventually.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:03:39):**  Okay.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:03:40):**  Well, I kind of grew up around construction most of my life and in one form or another,  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:03:47):**  I've been involved in construction for over 30 years.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:03:52):**  And AirCrete is something that just kind of surfaced as an alternative building method  
**[0:03:57-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:03:57):**  when I was, you know, I've built everything.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:04:00):**  I've rammed earth, I've packed cob, I've done waddle and daub.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:04:05):**  And for a situation coming up in my life, it just happens to be that this was a super  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:04:11):**  convenient answer that one person can take out into the middle of absolutely nowhere  
**[0:04:16-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:04:16):**  and slap together.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:04:18):**  Okay.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:04:19):**  So like we were doing before, let's start by talking about what it is and how it differs  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:04:24):**  from what people already know about concrete itself.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:04:28):**  Right.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:04:30):**  AirCrete is not cement.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:04:32):**  AirCrete is just Portland.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:04:35):**  You know, technically, cement is the combination of Portland cement and sand and gravel.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:04:41):**  But the difference with AirCrete is that we entrain air into the actual Portland cement.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:04:47):**  We inflate it six times its normal volume and this creates an insulating structural  
**[0:04:54-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:04:54):**  product.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:04:55):**  So it's both structure and insulation.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:04:57):**  It's not as strong as cement, but it's compressively, it's just as strong as a two by four wall  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:05:05):**  or any thickness of wall on 24 inch centers.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:05:09):**  So that's like a rigid foam held together with the same cement that would make up concrete,  
**[0:05:16-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:05:16):**  but without the heavy added material of sand and gravel.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:05:19):**  Exactly.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:05:20):**  And a lot of air, which makes it light.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:05:22):**  Sure.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:05:23):**  All right.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:05:24):**  So walk me through the process.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:05:25):**  What kind of equipment do you need and how long does it take to make a mix like this?  
**[0:05:30-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:05:30):**  What are the different ingredients?  
**[0:05:31-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:05:31):**  All right.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:05:32):**  Well the primary ingredient, of course, is just a bag of Portland cement and water.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:05:39):**  Typically you'll add about five gallons of water to an entire bag of Portland cement.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:05:45):**  And then you'll do this, I like to have a barrel with a pivot on it so I can eliminate  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:05:50):**  any lifting when at all possible.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:05:54):**  And you just use an eight amp or stronger drill and a good three blade flat spiral mixer  
**[0:06:01-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:06:01):**  and you turn your foam on.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:06:04):**  And the foam is, it can be at soap bubbles, but honestly some kind of foaming agents like  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:06:12):**  Drexel foam is a lot stronger, works better.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:06:17):**  And so you have another five gallons of water that is a dilution of your foaming agent and  
**[0:06:23-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:06:23):**  water.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:06:24):**  And you turn on a pump and you pump this into the bottom of your mixing container and you  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:06:28):**  run your drill until it has inflated itself to a mark on your mixing container that equals  
**[0:06:34-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:06:34):**  about six cubic feet.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:06:36):**  Wow.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:06:37):**  Okay.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:06:38):**  And this is all contained in what size of a bucket that you're doing this?  
**[0:06:42-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:06:42):**  Well for a single 92 pound bag of Portland cement, we use a 50 gallon drum and a 30 inch  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:06:51):**  mixing blade, which works out to just about six cubic feet by the time the cement gets  
**[0:06:55-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:06:55):**  into the drill.  
**[0:06:57-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:06:57):**  Gotcha.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:06:58):**  And what kind of chemicals are the foaming agents made up of?  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:07:01):**  Are there different options or like the one you mentioned that was ideal?  
**[0:07:05-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:07:05):**  Is that really what you recommend?  
**[0:07:07-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:07:07):**  Yeah, I really recommend the Drexel foam.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:07:10):**  You know, people like the idea of using something like seventh generation and certainly I could  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:07:15):**  support the idea of supporting a company that's trying to do the right thing.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:07:21):**  But Drexel is actually, it's made out of proteins from animals apparently.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:07:30):**  It's a byproduct of the existing slaughter industry, which is not a beautiful topic,  
**[0:07:36-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:07:36):**  but it's non-toxic in other words.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:07:39):**  Gotcha.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:07:40):**  So you've got non-vegan walls, but it's not a toxic product either.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:07:44):**  Exactly.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:07:45):**  All right.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:07:46):**  So give me an idea of what the construction process looks like.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:07:49):**  Once you've mixed your foam up in this 55 gallon barrel and you said you've got it on  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:07:55):**  a pivot to avoid having to lift anything, where are you pouring this in?  
**[0:07:59-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:07:59):**  How are you forming it into a wall structure?  
**[0:08:02-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:08:02):**  Well, you know, if you're building something like a dome or you want blocks to stack, then  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:08:06):**  you'll have a block form, a mold sitting right there beside you and you'll just simply pour  
**[0:08:11-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:08:11):**  it into this mold.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:08:13):**  And when you're done mixing and pouring, you insert metal or even plastic dividers and  
**[0:08:21-0:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:08:21):**  you wait 24 hours.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:08:22):**  And at the end of that 24 hours, you pull your blocks out of your mold.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:08:26):**  And right then, even though they're still somewhat brittle, you can pick them up and  
**[0:08:32-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:08:32):**  begin construction with them right then.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:08:35):**  And that is the more laborious method because then you have to mortar these blocks back  
**[0:08:39-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:08:39):**  together.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:08:41):**  And that's not with regular mortar, that would be with an air creep mortar.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:08:44):**  And then there's the option to build a cast structure and it can be rectangular, it can  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:08:51):**  be circular.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:08:53):**  It can be almost any shape as long as you can create a mold to contain your air creting  
**[0:08:57-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:08:57):**  until it sets.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:08:59):**  And that casting method is my preferred method because it's just so fast and it takes out  
**[0:09:04-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:09:04):**  so much of the time and the labor.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:09:07):**  Okay, so I guess it depends on the design and the form of your building which one might  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:09:15):**  have advantages because, you know, I've heard you mention that this is a really good material  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:09:20):**  to take out in the middle of nowhere and be able to construct with a minimal amount of  
**[0:09:24-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:09:24):**  materials.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:09:25):**  But if you have to put together some complicated form work, that's going to up the labor and  
**[0:09:29-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:09:29):**  the difficulty of the build.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:09:31):**  Oh, absolutely.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:09:33):**  Obviously blocks are the most simplistic way that you can build and it's, you know, there's  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:09:38):**  huge industries around using blocks and a lot of your common hired labor, of course,  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:09:43):**  already knows how to work with blocks.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:09:44):**  So it lends itself to simplicity.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:09:47):**  Sure.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:09:48):**  Now, you mentioned too that there's an air crete mortar that needs to be used when assembling  
**[0:09:53-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:09:53):**  the blocks.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:09:54):**  Is that a different mixture or are you really just taking what you would normally put into  
**[0:09:58-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:09:58):**  the forms and using that as your mortar?  
**[0:10:01-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:10:01):**  Yeah, for the mortar, it's basically the same thing except you're adding a product which  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:10:07):**  is typically latex or acrylic bonding agent.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:10:12):**  And the reason you put this in the mix is you want it to really stick to the blocks.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:10:18):**  It's a more thin mix than standard mortar.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:10:21):**  And so you don't want something that's just going to run out and you don't want something  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:10:28):**  that's not going to fully bond your block to create a weak spot in your construction  
**[0:10:32-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:10:32):**  later.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:10:33):**  Sure.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:10:34):**  Are there any risks of maybe the entrance of impurities either in your foaming agent  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:10:39):**  or during the process that could compromise the foaming ability of the material and cause  
**[0:10:44-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:10:44):**  it to deflate before it cures?  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:10:47):**  Well generally, the most common thing is if it's deflating, there's been too much water  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:10:53):**  added to the mix and you just simply have to reduce the amount of water.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:10:58):**  Generally your foam is going to work unless of course you don't have enough of your foaming  
**[0:11:02-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:11:02):**  agent.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:11:03):**  For example, if you're using a five gallon bucket for your foaming agent, you have to  
**[0:11:07-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:11:07):**  put an entire 16 ounce bottle of soap into that.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:11:10):**  And so if you run short on soap, then the bubbles will pop.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:11:15):**  And the idea behind the bubble is not to really hold the structure except as long as necessary  
**[0:11:22-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:11:22):**  to entrain it into the cement.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:11:23):**  It's actually the thickness or viscosity of the cement that holds the bubble in place.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:11:28):**  So the bubble is just there long enough to get the bubble mixed into the cement.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:11:32):**  Yeah, that makes sense.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:11:34):**  Now you mentioned that the bricks or the form work would be workable within 24 hours, but  
**[0:11:41-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:11:41):**  cement takes a longer period of time to cure.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:11:44):**  So how long would you recommend before putting any kind of load or stress on those blocks  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:11:49):**  or the casts or the molds, I suppose, before it can really take the amount of pressure  
**[0:11:55-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:11:55):**  that it was designed to?  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:11:58):**  Well it reaches full design strength in about 28, 30 days.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:12:02):**  And of course that depends upon temperature obviously.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:12:06):**  You can accelerate that by adding hot water to the mix.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:12:09):**  But generally, you know, in 24 hours you can pick up the blocks, you can move them, you  
**[0:12:13-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:12:13):**  can go ahead and build a building with them.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:12:15):**  But obviously you have to avoid striking them or dropping them or anything that could put  
**[0:12:20-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:12:20):**  a microfracture or crack that's going to show up as a break after the block matures.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:12:27):**  And once it's fully cured, do you have an idea of how much PSI it can withstand?  
**[0:12:33-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:12:33):**  Yeah, with the equipment that I have, my scale tops out, but I'm consistently getting over  
**[0:12:40-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:12:40):**  168 pounds per square inch.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:12:43):**  Okay, that's a good reference point to get an idea of how much of a roof heft you can  
**[0:12:48-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:12:48):**  put on it.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:12:49):**  Well, if you think about snow load and you know how much weight that is, and then you  
**[0:12:56-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:12:56):**  look at how much cement, for example, a 450 square foot single bedroom small or tiny house,  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:13:04):**  the whole thing soaking wet, if that were even possible to get it immediately out of  
**[0:13:08-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:13:08):**  the barrel and stack it up, is somewhere around 53,000 pounds.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:13:14):**  And when you actually divide that out over the thickness of a wall that's six or eight  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:13:18):**  inches thick, it actually winds up being under 11 pounds per square inch.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:13:23):**  So there's actually this tremendous safety margin between what it's capable of withstanding  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:13:28):**  versus what is actually put on the structure.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:13:32):**  Okay, and now I know, especially in the case of the domes, you recommend then giving a  
**[0:13:39-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:13:39):**  stucco layer on the entire outer portion of one of these bubble forms.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:13:45):**  And I think a lot of people who are familiar with aircrete in any way have usually seen  
**[0:13:50-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:13:50):**  these types of images.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:13:51):**  I feel like this is how it's gotten, it's become best known.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:13:56):**  I know I first learned about it when I saw some of those forms at a construction site  
**[0:14:00-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:14:00):**  in Thailand, I believe it was.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:14:03):**  And so covering it then with stucco, this is not still the same aircrete mixture.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:14:09):**  This is a proper cement, sorry, concrete stucco.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:14:13):**  Correct?  
**[0:14:14-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:14:14):**  Yeah, correct.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:14:17):**  First of all, it's, you know, aircrete has a great amount of compressive strength, relatively  
**[0:14:23-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:14:23):**  speaking, but it has very little tensile strength.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:14:26):**  So you know, if you put it on two blocks, for example, and apply pressure in the middle,  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:14:32):**  it's going to pull apart.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:14:34):**  And the way you strengthen that is with a reinforcing fabric.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:14:39):**  And this fabric is applied to the exterior with a regular cement mixture that's fairly  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:14:45):**  high in acrylic or latex, and that is used to bond the outside.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:14:51):**  So it's like a more conventional stucco mix.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:14:53):**  You apply it to the exterior, you lay on your fabric, and then you work this through the  
**[0:14:57-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:14:57):**  fabric and then you apply a finish coat to the top of the fabric.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:15:03):**  And you know, acrylic stuccos are great if you want to put a second final finish on there.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:15:09):**  You can just paint it, but obviously because it's a porous cement structure, it can absorb  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:15:14):**  water and it is important to seal it from the elements.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:15:19):**  Have you experimented with other types of sealants other than cement stucco?  
**[0:15:24-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:15:24):**  Because it seems to me that while the ease and the transportability of the equipment  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:15:28):**  and the materials to make something like this potentially in a remote region, would be somewhat  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:15:32):**  undercut by the amount of sand or gravel, I guess gravel not so much for the stucco,  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:15:37):**  but sand that you would have to either import or excavate on site in order to do that final  
**[0:15:43-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:15:43):**  layer.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:15:44):**  Yeah, we've actually in Mexico, we started using just a, it's a, what's the word elastomer  
**[0:15:53-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:15:53):**  type brick and stucco paint.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:15:56):**  So it's literally just a can of paint that can be applied to seal it and it works very  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:16:01):**  successfully and it's just maybe, you know, would require a little more maintenance in  
**[0:16:05-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:16:05):**  the long run.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:16:06):**  You know, you'd need to repaint your structure every few years where something like an acrylic  
**[0:16:10-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:16:10):**  stucco is going to really maintain that seal for a longer period of time.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:16:16):**  Sure.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:16:17):**  Yeah, I know that the few problems that I've had and I've seen when I worked in the industrial  
**[0:16:22-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:16:22):**  construction trades was more that, you know, given the brittleness of a cement stucco,  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:16:28):**  it can have, even if you're not able to see it very easily, sort of micro cracks in it  
**[0:16:32-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:16:32):**  that allow moisture through.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:16:34):**  And I would imagine in the case of putting on a dome like that, that could be a risk  
**[0:16:38-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:16:38):**  that could compromise the structure.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:16:39):**  Have you come up against any issues like that?  
**[0:16:42-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:16:42):**  Well, I haven't so far because when you put that finish coat and that fabric on there,  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:16:50):**  it's generally waterproof and it's not going to crack through that fabric and the layer  
**[0:16:54-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:16:54):**  underneath the fabric is generally water resistant.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:16:58):**  I'm not going to say waterproof, but you know, I've never seen an instance where water was  
**[0:17:02-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:17:02):**  able to soak into a wall.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:17:05):**  Gotcha.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:17:06):**  Now you've worked with a whole bunch of different types of designs.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:17:09):**  I've seen on your website, especially the domes, those sort of bubble forms that we  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:17:12):**  talked about, but you said you also really like to work with formwork.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:17:16):**  What are some of your favorite designs or that you especially advocate for people who  
**[0:17:20-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:17:20):**  are getting started with this material?  
**[0:17:22-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:17:22):**  Well, you know, you can do rectangular forms, but I just happen to really love the circular  
**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:17:29):**  form.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:17:31):**  And so that cylinder shape is the one I prefer because you can buy that cheap utility grade  
**[0:17:37-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:17:37):**  plywood.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:17:38):**  You can slap it together and the very nature of the shape itself, it's almost like when  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:17:42):**  you roll up a sheet of paper, it becomes strong enough that you could put a cup of coffee  
**[0:17:47-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:17:47):**  on top of a sheet of paper.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:17:49):**  The shape itself holds the form in place and with very little effort, you can put up a  
**[0:17:54-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:17:54):**  form that doesn't cost a lot.  
**[0:17:57-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:17:57):**  And one person could bucket this in.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:17:59):**  For example, if you were building a small 16 foot cabin, you can actually make it livable  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:18:06):**  in 14 days because it only takes six, seven days to get the wall up.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:18:10):**  And that's if you're by yourself and if you stick to it and get the work done.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:18:15):**  Hmm.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:18:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:18:17):**  I mean, those types of statistics are really promising for people who are working with  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:18:21):**  limited resources or don't necessarily have help available to get a project like this  
**[0:18:26-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:18:26):**  done.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:18:27):**  Oftentimes just getting moved into a spot, even if it doesn't happen to be your final  
**[0:18:30-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:18:30):**  finished building on the land, can make the difference between continuing to pay rent  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:18:36):**  somewhere else and having the ability to save extra money and put on the time on the site  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:18:41):**  that you need to build something more, more substantial in the longer run.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:18:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:18:47):**  Yeah, you're exactly right.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:18:48):**  Because sometimes if you can get out of paying rent, for example, if you're just starting,  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:18:54):**  that's the quickest way to really move forward on the project.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:18:57):**  And sometimes I come up against this all or nothing thinking that people have.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:19:02):**  And it's like, well, I've got to have my mansion in every detail right now.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:19:07):**  But if you take more of the attitude that the original settlers of this country had,  
**[0:19:11-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:19:11):**  then you start with what's necessary.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:19:13):**  And maybe that little initial structure that gets you on the land immediately, maybe that  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:19:18):**  becomes your closet or your bathroom later.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:19:20):**  Or maybe it's not even attached to the house.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:19:22):**  Maybe it's a storage building.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:19:24):**  So yeah, it absolutely lends itself to a quick project that can put you in something.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:19:29):**  And it's not like a tent or a yurt that really does leave you uncomfortable.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:19:33):**  These structures are very comfortable.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:19:36):**  My favorite part about taking on sort of a smaller project like that is that a lot of  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:19:40):**  the people who are attempting this for the first time either don't have a lot of construction  
**[0:19:45-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:19:45):**  experience or I guess even in the other case of not having any familiarity with living  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:19:53):**  in kind of compromised situations like that where they don't have the luxuries that they're  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:19:58):**  used to or the plumbing and the conveniences.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:20:02):**  And certainly in my experience, even just living in tents sometimes, you realize how  
**[0:20:06-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:20:06):**  little you actually need to be healthy and to be happy.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:20:09):**  And the few things that you really miss, you will make a priority when you make another  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:20:14):**  building or design another structure for the longer term.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:20:18):**  Oh, absolutely.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:20:20):**  It's in my opinion a great thing to experience because like you said, you begin to realize  
**[0:20:25-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:20:25):**  what you can do without and then what you really need.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:20:29):**  And sometimes you just you distill it down to the essence of what it is that you need.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:20:34):**  And you can make mistakes on a small project and it's not a deal breaker.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:20:39):**  It's no problem.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:20:42):**  For sure.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:20:44):**  And you mentioned that this has insulative properties and that's often one of the things  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:20:48):**  that especially natural builders come up against that there are few options for insulating  
**[0:20:53-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:20:53):**  a building if you go purely natural structures.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:20:56):**  Do you have the stats on the R value per inch of aircrete?  
**[0:21:02-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:21:02):**  Well, I don't have an exact R value.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:21:05):**  You can do it calculating.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:21:08):**  But what I do is actually measure.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:21:10):**  I just put a video out on YouTube on how to do this.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:21:13):**  And you can actually raise or lower the temperature of the structure and measure it.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:21:19):**  And what I'm finding is that it's consistently slightly less than a standard fiberglass insulation.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:21:25):**  And per square foot, it takes an additional six and a quarter percent of insulation to  
**[0:21:33-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:21:33):**  achieve the same value.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:21:35):**  So the walls need to be a little thicker if you're depending upon a certain R value like  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:21:41):**  two by fours R11 or R13 for a two by six wall.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:21:45):**  Then maybe instead of doing a six inch wall, you push it out seven to eight inches to have  
**[0:21:50-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:21:50):**  an equivalent amount of insulation.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:21:53):**  Gotcha.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:21:54):**  And let's talk a little bit more about the compromises that we're dealing with with using  
**[0:21:59-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:21:59):**  cement as a building material.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:22:01):**  You and I went back and forth by email for a little while and I was tentative to promote  
**[0:22:06-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:22:06):**  the idea of aircrete on this podcast because in the past I've really focused just on natural  
**[0:22:10-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:22:10):**  materials.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:22:12):**  But I know you've got experience working with other natural materials in contrast.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:22:15):**  So how does this stack up in your opinion to natural or more locally produced or less  
**[0:22:23-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:22:23):**  processed materials as far as sort of ease of use and construction and impact on the  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:22:32):**  environment through the process and the manufacturing?  
**[0:22:36-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:22:36):**  Okay.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:22:38):**  You know, first of all, it depends upon your environment.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:22:41):**  Whatever you do, whatever you build, it really needs to be appropriate for where you're at.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:22:47):**  If you're in the tropics, you don't necessarily need walls, but if you're in the Northeast,  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:22:51):**  you have driving rains and cold, you need walls.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:22:55):**  And in a similar manner, whenever you're choosing alternative building in the majority of the  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:23:00):**  climates, if we're designing to be a passive system, you really need insulation and thermal  
**[0:23:06-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:23:06):**  gas.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:23:08):**  Aircrete of course is structural and it provides insulation as well.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:23:13):**  With insulation, you can provide an active source of cooling or you can design to be  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:23:21):**  more passive using windows to absorb the heat.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:23:26):**  But it's not, you know, it is different.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:23:30):**  It does produce a great deal more pollution.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:23:33):**  Shovell materials are very nice and forgiving, but on the flip side of that is the amount  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:23:38):**  of labor and time it can take you because typically a lot of natural building requires  
**[0:23:43-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:23:43):**  excavation of quite a lot of material.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:23:46):**  And if you're doing that by shovel, it's absolutely backbreaking, miserable work.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:23:52):**  Or you have to rent a large excavator or something to do the work for you, or you need a great  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:23:57):**  deal of hands present whenever you do your project to get it done.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:24:02):**  So again, like I said in the beginning, aircrete is kind of a convenience thing in terms of  
**[0:24:07-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:24:07):**  speed.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:24:09):**  You know, if you're paying someone to build alternatively, it often costs a substantial  
**[0:24:14-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:24:14):**  amount more than conventional construction even.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:24:17):**  That is true.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:24:18):**  So you know, you have to look at your situation and decide what's appropriate for you.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:24:23):**  Now, you know, as far as aircrete and what it does to the environment, it's obviously  
**[0:24:31-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:24:31):**  not as environmentally friendly.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:24:33):**  It's made from limestone.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:24:34):**  This limestone has to be heated.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:24:36):**  When you heat limestone, you drive off carbon dioxide, not to mention the energy used in  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:24:41):**  the manufacture and transport of this limestone that becomes our cement.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:24:46):**  But basically for every 2,205 pounds of Portland cement that's produced, there's 2,044 pounds  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:24:54):**  of carbon dioxide that goes into the air in that production process.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:24:58):**  You know, if you're just looking strictly at a CO2 perspective.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:25:03):**  And so to help get an idea of what that means, if you were to build that one bedroom 450  
**[0:25:08-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:25:08):**  square foot dome, you would need about 26,200 pounds of cement.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:25:14):**  And that would off-gas into the environment about 24,286 pounds of CO2.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:25:22):**  That's not insignificant.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:25:23):**  Now to me, the compromise with that always is like, yeah, building with industrial materials  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:25:29):**  can go a lot faster, but it's because a lot of the processing and a lot of the manufacturing  
**[0:25:34-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:25:34):**  has been pre-done for you to make it easy at the point of construction.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:25:38):**  Whereas because of all of that processing not being the case, if you're excavating your  
**[0:25:42-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:25:42):**  materials by hand, if you're felling and shaping wood on your own, you're doing the processing  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:25:48):**  there on site and because chances are you're using less machinery to do it, the efficiency  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:25:54):**  goes down, but you tend to be paying the money to a person rather than to a corporation in  
**[0:25:59-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:25:59):**  an industrial process.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:26:00):**  And I'm not saying that there aren't mitigating reasons for both sides, but those were always  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:26:06):**  kind of how I did the calculations for myself and explained it to clients.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:26:10):**  Now I guess the pitfall for me when it comes to industrial materials, especially ones that  
**[0:26:18-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:26:18):**  are lower in price, that doesn't reflect the entire process and are easier to assemble  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:26:25):**  is just a matter of like, which industry are you paying, right?  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:26:29):**  Are you paying the industry that does all of these things through mechanical processes,  
**[0:26:35-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:26:35):**  large mining, everything that you just mentioned with the CO2 embedded in it and the transport  
**[0:26:38-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:26:38):**  there.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:26:40):**  And in facilitating the ease for the user or the construction, the person constructing  
**[0:26:46-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:26:46):**  the building, the risk for me is then that people are going to start slapping up air  
**[0:26:52-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:26:52):**  creep buildings or concrete structures or, you know, whatever plastic or petroleum based  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:26:58):**  deposit comes out next.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:27:02):**  Not thinking through the entire lifespan of the building.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:27:05):**  Can you talk a little bit about how you see the lifespan of this product weathering over  
**[0:27:10-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:27:10):**  time?  
**[0:27:12-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:27:12):**  Can it be like, does it last as long as cement the way that we think of traditionally or  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:27:19):**  does it kind of degrade and spall because it doesn't have the same structural integrity  
**[0:27:24-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:27:24):**  over time?  
**[0:27:26-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:27:26):**  I've never observed any degrading of the material.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:27:30):**  It's my belief that it can be a multi-generational house and a lot of it.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:27:36):**  And this would, of course, apply to any structure.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:27:38):**  But you know, if you were to take your greywater and plant just 13 trees beside your structure,  
**[0:27:47-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:27:47):**  you would in 40 years zero the carbon footprint of the structure and assuming a very small  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:27:53):**  size of the structure or what kind of structure we're talking about?  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:27:57):**  Well as an example, a little one small bedroom, 450 square foot dome.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:28:02):**  Gotcha.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:28:03):**  Just for reference.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:28:04):**  Right.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:28:05):**  And I would want to plant more trees if you're building a bigger structure.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:28:09):**  And of course therein lies part of the American attitude.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:28:12):**  We want to have a 2,500 square foot house for a single person who's always at work and  
**[0:28:19-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:28:19):**  never home.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:28:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:28:21):**  So you can, I believe you can be responsible with it.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:28:24):**  And yes, it's a big deal to go out and strip mine a mountain range or something for limestone  
**[0:28:31-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:28:31):**  as opposed to excavating local materials.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:28:34):**  And it's definitely nice to actually put the money in the hands of a person instead of  
**[0:28:39-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:28:39):**  a soulless corporation.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:28:41):**  But as far as offsetting the carbon footprint, you can do that.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:28:46):**  The shade from the trees, electricity usage.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:28:49):**  Actually the cost of ownership of a home is often living in the home more than the home  
**[0:28:54-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:28:54):**  itself.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:28:55):**  And it even holds true for the CO2.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:28:58):**  For each kilowatt of electricity you produce, there's something like 1.4 pounds of CO2 release.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:29:03):**  So over that same 40 year period, if you're using electricity like the average American,  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:29:11):**  that's nearly 600,000 pounds of CO2 because you're using electricity from the grid.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:29:17):**  Or if you're driving to work, you know, over that same period of time, for what average  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:29:21):**  American over that 40 years, you'd produce 2 million pounds of carbon dioxide driving.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:29:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:29:27):**  And ultimately that's why I was really looking forward to this conversation because though  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:29:33):**  I'm not entirely convinced that air create is sort of the solution compared to natural  
**[0:29:38-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:29:38):**  buildings, it does offer a much more positive alternative to conventional, I guess, industrial  
**[0:29:44-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:29:44):**  and highly destructive construction and is perhaps a stepping stone towards a better  
**[0:29:49-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:29:49):**  way of building.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:29:51):**  But also because I have read some of your articles and heard some of your talks, not  
**[0:29:56-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:29:56):**  only on other podcasts, but in your videos.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:29:58):**  And I can tell that you've thought through more of the process of, regardless of the  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:30:04):**  material itself, kind of how we live and design with our homes is the bigger issue.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:30:09):**  Because I mean, you know, having worked with natural materials in the past, you can design  
**[0:30:16-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:30:16):**  a consumptive building with natural materials.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:30:19):**  You can still live a consumptive lifestyle, a wasteful lifestyle, even if you kind of,  
**[0:30:24-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:30:24):**  you know, invest in sustainable or regenerative technologies and green this and that, you  
**[0:30:30-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:30:30):**  know, it has much more to do with the decisions that you make on a daily basis and how or  
**[0:30:37-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:30:37):**  where you're sourcing your resources that you depend on at a regular time.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:30:42):**  And from the designs and especially the integration of things like appropriate technology, which  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:30:48):**  you've mentioned in other articles, you can kind of offset this smaller building cost  
**[0:30:54-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:30:54):**  through, yeah, through the decisions and the infrastructure that you put in and around  
**[0:31:00-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:31:00):**  it.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:31:01):**  So can you talk about some of the other features that you would advocate for integrating in  
**[0:31:05-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:31:05):**  with an air-crete building?  
**[0:31:08-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:31:08):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:31:09):**  You know, talking about the amount of CO2 and energy used, honestly, you know, there's  
**[0:31:17-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:31:17):**  all this great alternative stuff out there.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:31:19):**  You probably have heard of cool tubes where you bury pipes in the ground and they create  
**[0:31:23-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:31:23):**  cooling for your house.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:31:24):**  Sure.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:31:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:31:26):**  And so, you know, it sounds like such a great idea, but then you actually put the energy  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:31:32):**  cost into it to make that effective, to move enough air through a system like that.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:31:36):**  You wind up using enough energy that it's the equivalent to using something like a ground  
**[0:31:41-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:31:41):**  source heat pump.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:31:44):**  With one, you're at the mercy of what the environment gives you, and if you live in  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:31:47):**  an environment where it's consistently hot, you may not be cool enough, certainly by the  
**[0:31:51-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:31:51):**  end of the summer.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:31:53):**  And then you've got the issue of a system that grows mold that you can't clean.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:31:58):**  And you know, society, as you're talking about it, we've got all this prepackaged stuff and  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:32:06):**  it's the very lifestyles that we live and the value that we place on things that I think  
**[0:32:11-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:32:11):**  may be the core issue, for example.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:32:14):**  I could go out on my property and just using the small trees and sticks and limbs, I could  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:32:20):**  build a double walled wattle and daub house.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:32:24):**  Maybe I put a liner in the bottom for waterproofing and then I fill it with a straw to give me  
**[0:32:29-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:32:29):**  an R32 insulating house that's built, you know, 99% free from local onsite materials.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:32:38):**  But the way society is structured, it's so much more quote valuable to use my time to  
**[0:32:44-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:32:44):**  just go buy a truckload of clay and a truckload of sand and some timber and a saw, cut it  
**[0:32:49-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:32:49):**  up and then assemble an artificial structure out of natural materials.  
**[0:32:54-0:33:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:32:54):**  Yeah, so, you know, there's always that struggle there because like you said, you can make  
**[0:33:01-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:33:01):**  an alternative building.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:33:03):**  It can be as industrial and more costly and more harmful even than buying something from  
**[0:33:10-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:33:10):**  a larger source.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:33:12):**  So, you know, it's kind of like that permaculture saying, it depends, right?  
**[0:33:16-0:33:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:33:16):**  You know, it always depends.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:33:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:33:19):**  And if someone has a bottled answer for you, you can almost bet yourself that it's going  
**[0:33:23-0:33:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:33:23):**  to be wrong because if you're not taking in considerations of the context, the place,  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:33:28):**  the lifestyle, all of those factors, it's not really going to be a solution that works  
**[0:33:33-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:33:33):**  for those things.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:33:35):**  And I do appreciate that aspect, that perspective that you bring to this.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:33:39):**  And I certainly don't consider myself to be such a purist.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:33:42):**  I mean, even as a natural builder myself, I've worked in industrial building trades  
**[0:33:47-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:33:47):**  and I don't think I've, I don't know of anybody who's built an entirely natural building.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:33:53):**  I mean, you're still using screws and nails at the very least.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:33:56):**  And if you want electricity and plumbing, good luck trying to find natural materials  
**[0:34:00-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:34:00):**  that will achieve those types of things for you.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:34:02):**  I mean, we just live a lifestyle and in a world that requires a certain amount of industrial  
**[0:34:08-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:34:08):**  inputs in order to interact with it the way that it was designed.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:34:12):**  And so a certain amount of compromise and hybridizing of traditional skills, natural  
**[0:34:17-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:34:17):**  materials, and the context of the modern world has to happen.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:34:22):**  And I think that this is a very important conversation to have when you get to the point  
**[0:34:26-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:34:26):**  of designing for context in place.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:34:29):**  And before I forget it though, because we are kind of going deeper into the philosophy  
**[0:34:34-0:34:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:34:34):**  of the building and the living environments that we create for ourselves, you talked a  
**[0:34:38-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:34:38):**  bit about how you really liked the rounded and the dome design.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:34:42):**  And certainly this isn't unique just to aircrete, but I've seen it a lot in like earthbag construction  
**[0:34:48-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:34:48):**  or sometimes called super Adobe.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:34:51):**  And it can be achieved with a number of different types of materials.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:34:54):**  The one thing that I've personally always found, and I've had a lot of clients come  
**[0:34:57-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:34:57):**  to me, like because people get really enamored with this kind of curvy, organic or circular  
**[0:35:04-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:35:04):**  shape in the design of their homes, but it can be really hard to furnish, to add the  
**[0:35:11-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:35:11):**  types of things that we're used to, you know, everything from tables and chairs to washing  
**[0:35:15-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:35:15):**  machines, or I mean, they're all built for rectilinear design.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:35:19):**  How have you kind of overcome that or worked it out within your own buildings, or do you  
**[0:35:24-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:35:24):**  just simply make everything custom?  
**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:35:28):**  Well you know, things like cabinets against the wall, they're going to have to be custom,  
**[0:35:32-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:35:32):**  but we have to deal with the mindset too.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:35:35):**  You know, we've often grown up in sticks box houses or furniture square, so we shove it  
**[0:35:39-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:35:39):**  to the walls and we walk through the middle of the room.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:35:42):**  But if you actually stop and think about it a little differently, and instead of trying  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:35:46):**  to do the same thing with a different shape, instead of shoving the square peg in a round  
**[0:35:51-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:35:51):**  hole, you can put your furniture in the middle facing outwards and let the outer rounded  
**[0:35:56-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:35:56):**  edges be the walkways and the pathways.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:35:58):**  So it just requires a little different layout and thought process, and it's actually pretty  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:36:05):**  amazing how roomy the structure can feel and how you can kind of avoid a lot of those issues  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:36:10):**  by just simply not packing everything around the edge because it's not a box and it is  
**[0:36:15-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:36:15):**  curved.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:36:16):**  So you know, obviously things like appliances and stoves, they're just going to come off  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:36:21):**  the shelf the way they are unless you're going to build a rocket, a cob, indoor stove and  
**[0:36:27-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:36:27):**  heater then you do have to make some compromise.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:36:30):**  You definitely should, those things are super cool.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:36:35):**  I agree with all of that except for one part.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:36:37):**  When it comes to domes, I'm not crazy tall, but I'm six foot and if I'm walking around  
**[0:36:43-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:36:43):**  the edge of a dome and it starts to curve in, I've often found that really uncomfortable.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:36:49):**  And though I'm totally on board with the, like I love a curvilinear or sort of more  
**[0:36:53-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:36:53):**  organic form for interior shapes, I really agree that it can feel a lot more roomy and  
**[0:37:01-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:37:01):**  certainly a lot more comforting than boxy and hard shapes and sharp lines and such.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:37:09):**  But certainly I would recommend for people who are a little bit taller to consider how  
**[0:37:14-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:37:14):**  you're going to move around in that space because if you've got a hunch or kind of bend  
**[0:37:18-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:37:18):**  as you're going around, it's fun for a novelty, but if you're going to be doing that every  
**[0:37:24-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:37:24):**  day because I've definitely lived in those structures, it's a point that you want to  
**[0:37:29-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:37:29):**  consider in the design.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:37:30):**  Oh absolutely.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:37:32):**  You know, obviously with cylinders it's not an issue.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:37:34):**  Now with domes, typically because it looks artistic and kind of nice, we actually raise  
**[0:37:40-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:37:40):**  the entire structure above the equator.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:37:43):**  And I advocate using 3D software and since if it's going to be your house, you decide  
**[0:37:48-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:37:48):**  how close you need to be to the wall.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:37:50):**  I say about a foot from my height.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:37:53):**  I want to be able to pretty much, or maybe six inches, I want to be able to walk up to  
**[0:37:57-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:37:57):**  the wall without hitting my head on the wall.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:38:00):**  So we'll either raise the entire structure and let it tuck under more like a sphere or  
**[0:38:04-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:38:04):**  we'll actually put it on a stem wall.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:38:06):**  But absolutely you do need to be aware of that issue because nobody wants to walk around  
**[0:38:12-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:38:12):**  having to lean their head to one side or bend over us.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:38:15):**  That would never be comfortable.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:38:16):**  I've just smacked my head on too many things to not mention that when talking about the  
**[0:38:20-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:38:20):**  design process.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:38:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:38:24):**  So look, to get back into sort of the theory and the concept of the design and the way  
**[0:38:29-0:38:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:38:29):**  that we live and such, I just finished actually having a conversation with April McGill, who's  
**[0:38:33-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:38:33):**  been on this podcast before and is going to be on an episode soon, maybe even before this  
**[0:38:38-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:38:38):**  one.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:38:39):**  And we kind of had come through a roundabout way to the conclusion that if you want to  
**[0:38:43-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:38:43):**  live as healthy as possible, you want to live as close to the outdoors as possible.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:38:49):**  And certainly that is easier in certain climates than it is in others.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:38:53):**  Like you mentioned in tropical areas where you barely need walls, maybe just sort of  
**[0:38:57-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:38:57):**  like insect guards and nets in a lot of cases if your roof overhangs are tall enough.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:39:04):**  What kind of environment does this aircreep allow for?  
**[0:39:10-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:39:10):**  I know that the insulation allows you then to live comfortably in a range of climates  
**[0:39:16-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:39:16):**  where the temperature swings are more extreme without having to import too much energy to  
**[0:39:21-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:39:21):**  do that in.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:39:22):**  But what are some of the design techniques within that that you would advocate for to  
**[0:39:26-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:39:26):**  allow for ventilation and make sure that you're still letting nature into the space?  
**[0:39:31-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:39:31):**  Yeah, I really like, first of all, good light.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:39:36):**  And I'm a really fan of, a big fan of these polished aluminum tubes.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:39:40):**  They don't let a lot of heat in, but man, they really bring a lot of light in.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:39:44):**  And air quality is very important.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:39:47):**  These domes, it's not like normal houses and fiberglass.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:39:52):**  Air does not blow through these walls.  
**[0:39:55-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:39:55):**  And so it's a very tight structure and it's absolutely necessary that you ventilate them  
**[0:39:59-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:39:59):**  properly otherwise you're going to line up with sweating walls and a humid environment  
**[0:40:05-0:40:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:40:05):**  and just generally unhealthy.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:40:07):**  So what I really prefer in this example is to install a, if you're in the south you can  
**[0:40:14-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:40:14):**  install an energy recovery ventilator.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:40:16):**  If you're in the north you need a heat recovery ventilator.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:40:19):**  But it's basically a box with an air heat exchanger and a fan.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:40:23):**  It doesn't pull much power at all, but it allows you to exchange the volume of the entire  
**[0:40:29-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:40:29):**  structure, you know, at least six times a day.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:40:32):**  That way the air stays fresh.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:40:34):**  But it has the advantage of balancing the incoming and outgoing air temperature so that  
**[0:40:40-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:40:40):**  you're not just wasting energy.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:40:42):**  And you know, if it's 100 outside you don't want it to be 100 inside.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:40:45):**  So you want to balance that air out without having to run your air conditioner more.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:40:49):**  And it's a good modern way to do that.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:40:53):**  If I wasn't going to do that then yeah, I would probably put in a skylight that can  
**[0:40:57-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:40:57):**  be opened and some lower windows in the direction of the prevailing breeze.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:41:02):**  And of course that depends on your lifestyle again if you want to live open.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:41:06):**  I really do like living outdoors and I totally agree with the idea.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:41:10):**  In fact, I love the idea of having an outdoor kitchen and when possible doing the living  
**[0:41:15-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:41:15):**  outside and then just retreating to a smaller living space when the weather is just not  
**[0:41:20-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:41:20):**  hospitable.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:41:23):**  Sure.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:41:24):**  Yeah, I've described this in the past to clients and then some of my design workshops of like  
**[0:41:29-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:41:29):**  a gradient that you want to achieve where only the most essential functions like sleeping,  
**[0:41:35-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:41:35):**  in some cases eating and washing are fully enclosed inside of a building.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:41:39):**  Now obviously this is going to change in the climate or in the area that you're living  
**[0:41:43-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:41:43):**  in and how many months out of the year it's comfortable for you to actually shift a lot  
**[0:41:49-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:41:49):**  of your functions into the outdoors.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:41:51):**  But then once the essentials are kind of taken up and you know enough storage space to store  
**[0:41:56-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:41:56):**  your essentials as well, try and move as many of your daily tasks into various states of  
**[0:42:04-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:42:04):**  outdoors.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:42:05):**  So maybe one would be like two or three walls encompassing an outdoor kitchen or living  
**[0:42:10-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:42:10):**  room space.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:42:12):**  From there on perhaps a semi-translucent roof and maybe one or no walls just a stick frame  
**[0:42:19-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:42:19):**  around it all the way out into a point where it's like stippled shade and water can still  
**[0:42:23-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:42:23):**  get through depending on the appropriateness of that design for your site.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:42:27):**  Have you worked with any designs like that integrating aircrete or other natural materials  
**[0:42:33-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:42:33):**  into the finished product?  
**[0:42:36-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:42:36):**  Well a lot of what I do right now is private workshops.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:42:38):**  We'll go out and teach people and they'll build their own houses and with aircrete I  
**[0:42:43-0:42:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:42:43):**  haven't had any real opportunity to do much more than create a nice trellised area with  
**[0:42:49-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:42:49):**  a lot of plants growing on it and a water feature that way you have a nice cool living  
**[0:42:53-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:42:53):**  space and you know that way your living area is generally outside most of the time.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:42:59):**  In other alternative structures I've you know I've worked with earthships and so obviously  
**[0:43:04-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:43:04):**  you know you've got the interior wall, you've got the greenhouse area, you've got an exterior  
**[0:43:08-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:43:08):**  wall.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:43:10):**  Those work great in so many climates in New Mexico where they build them of course you  
**[0:43:15-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:43:15):**  know it may be 113 during the day but then it's also 53 at night so it works perfect.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:43:21):**  In my climate you know we've built one structure where we have an outdoor kitchen you know  
**[0:43:28-0:43:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:43:28):**  it was a more conventional rammed earth house with foam insulation on it but we have a nice  
**[0:43:34-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:43:34):**  big outdoor kitchen that's designed the shrubbery goes out in a V or opens up into the prevailing  
**[0:43:40-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:43:40):**  breeze so it literally focuses the wind down on the area where you're going to be standing  
**[0:43:45-0:43:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:43:45):**  it creates a natural breezeway that's very comfortable and then we have vines on the  
**[0:43:50-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:43:50):**  top and they do most their cooking out there except whenever the weather's not good so  
**[0:43:56-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:43:56):**  yeah I've had the opportunity to do that on a couple of occasions just one with aircrete.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:44:05):**  Nice well it seems to me like this is kind of an infinitely moldable tool easy to work  
**[0:44:10-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:44:10):**  with, especially for people without technical experience and a lot of skills and you know  
**[0:44:16-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:44:16):**  though I have some hang-ups about the material itself I am very curious to see how this develops  
**[0:44:22-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:44:22):**  because it's only been a few years since I even really saw this come out on the scene  
**[0:44:26-0:44:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:44:26):**  and it's really exploded in popularity even to the point where a couple of my natural  
**[0:44:30-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:44:30):**  builder friends are getting involved with aircrete builds and advocating for it through  
**[0:44:35-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:44:35):**  their clients too just because of the ease and the quickness of the builds.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:44:40):**  I really appreciate you coming and sharing some of your perspective and experience on  
**[0:44:43-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:44:43):**  this as well as some good hard information I know you have a whole lot more that you  
**[0:44:48-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:44:48):**  could share with us but it's very well covered in your videos and on your website so before  
**[0:44:53-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:44:53):**  I let you go can you direct our listeners to where they can learn more and get in touch  
**[0:44:57-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:44:57):**  with you?  
**[0:45:00-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:45:00):**  Absolutely you can find me at the tinygiantlife.biz there's links to most everything there we  
**[0:45:06-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:45:06):**  do workshops we sell a online video course if you need a little extra something of course  
**[0:45:13-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:45:13):**  we have a YouTube channel the tiny giant lifestyle and it's intended to be more about lifestyle  
**[0:45:19-0:45:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:45:19):**  design than aircrete specifically but aircrete seems to be gaining quite a bit of interest  
**[0:45:24-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:45:24):**  and there's all the information about pretty much anything you would need to know for free  
**[0:45:30-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:45:30):**  in there you just kind of have to dig through the videos and you'll find it so yeah.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:45:36):**  Fantastic well Daniel thank you so much for coming on here and sharing such a well thought  
**[0:45:40-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:45:40):**  out perspective from experiences of both industrial and natural building I hope that we can catch  
**[0:45:46-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:45:46):**  up again and I'd love to hear more as things develop and new design ideas come through  
**[0:45:51-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-allen/#t=0:45:51):**  and this has been really cool so thank you so much for your time.

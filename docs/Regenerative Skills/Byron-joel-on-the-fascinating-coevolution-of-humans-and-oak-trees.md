**[0:06:46-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:06:46):**  And can you tell our listeners the Latin name of oaks, and then we'll just kind of dive  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:06:53):**  into this topic.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:06:54):**  Sure thing.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:06:56):**  The Latin name for oak is Quercus.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:06:58):**  And then within the genus of Quercus, there's about 800 species, give or take, from all  
**[0:07:07-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:07:07):**  around the world, mostly the Northern hemisphere.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:07:09):**  But I believe there may be some that go past the equatorial line in Mexico.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:07:18):**  And once upon a time, there was the Lithocarpus genus, which is a very closely related genus  
**[0:07:26-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:07:26):**  in the Fagesi family in Southeast Asia and China, which is kind of like a tropical, subtropical  
**[0:07:33-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:07:33):**  oak, which is really interesting for people to look into.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:07:36):**  So yeah, they're all around the world, in the Northern hemisphere at least, and now  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:07:40):**  they've been taken all around the world in the Southern hemisphere to Antipodean lands  
**[0:07:45-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:07:45):**  like Australia and South Africa and South America with colonial movement.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:07:53):**  And they're one of my favorite, they are my favorite tree in the world, and this is  
**[0:07:57-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:07:57):**  fair for you to choose from.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:07:58):**  Well, you named your business oak tree design.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:08:01):**  So I figured it was important to you.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:08:03):**  And I know you grew up shaded by an oak, a hundred year old oak, I believe in Perth,  
**[0:08:09-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:08:09):**  Australia.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:08:10):**  And was being close to that tree part of what kind of initially inspired your fascination  
**[0:08:16-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:08:16):**  and appreciation for oak trees?  
**[0:08:18-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:08:18):**  Yeah, indeed.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:08:20):**  And I wonder, I'm not exactly sure what it was, but I mean, in Australia where it's dominated  
**[0:08:28-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:08:28):**  by eucalyptus and other Australian native trees, which are famously kind of tough and  
**[0:08:36-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:08:36):**  hard and fire or pyrophilic, you know, they burn really well.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:08:43):**  In fact, they're designed to burn.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:08:46):**  Even if you have a big, beautiful, old established, lush deciduous tree from the Northern hemisphere,  
**[0:08:54-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:08:54):**  it kind of stands out.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:08:55):**  And this old English oak, we caught it in English oak, it may actually have been a hybrid,  
**[0:09:01-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:09:01):**  I assume it was, but big deciduous leafy green English oak in my yard, it just had this huge  
**[0:09:08-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:09:08):**  presence.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:09:09):**  It was kind of like the totem entity of the house in which I grew up in.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:09:18):**  And I just, yeah, it kind of marked the seasons of that house.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:09:24):**  They obviously lost its leaves in the winter time and it had its catkins burst out in spring  
**[0:09:34-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:09:34):**  and then its beautiful leafy green growth in the late spring and the kind of parasol  
**[0:09:43-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:09:43):**  that it would create in the summertime and shade the whole place.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:09:46):**  And then in late summer and autumn, the acorns would start falling.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:09:52):**  The character, you know, there's such character in those acorns with their little caps on  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:09:57):**  them and all the little seedling oaks that would pop up in the garden.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:10:02):**  It's funny, I've never seen that happen before, but that tree would be like one in a thousand  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:10:06):**  or so seedlings would be pure white.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:10:10):**  The leaves would be pure white and the stems would be pure white.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:10:14):**  And some of my earliest memories of my dad, as baby boomer men seem to obsess over just  
**[0:10:22-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:10:22):**  raking leaves constantly.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:10:23):**  They just can't handle the idea of a single leaf being in the wrong spot.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:10:29):**  So it drove him nuts.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:10:31):**  In fact, I think it's half the reason he sold the place.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:10:34):**  It's interesting the different relationship that you had with the tree and then your dad.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:10:38):**  Totally.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:10:39):**  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:10:41):**  And I remember saying to it one day when I was probably about, I don't know, five or  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:10:47):**  six, I remember actually vocalizing that I said to it something along the lines of, I  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:10:52):**  think you and I have some work to do together.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:10:56):**  And it really, it kind of gives me goosebumps to look back on that.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:11:00):**  I don't know what I did or didn't know or didn't feel, but it came out of my mouth and  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:11:05):**  it kind of stuck with me and it's formed.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:11:08):**  It has become like my own emblem, my own totem for what it presents, everything that it signifies.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:11:16):**  That's a wonderful, wonderful description of that tree and your relationship with the  
**[0:11:20-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:11:20):**  tree.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:11:21):**  I don't know how it felt about me.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:11:23):**  Well, it's probably like that's the guy that doesn't break up our leaves and seedlings.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:11:30):**  We like him.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:11:33):**  So you mentioned a bit where oaks are found around the world and what is, can you describe  
**[0:11:38-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:11:38):**  to our listeners, what are some natural oak habitats?  
**[0:11:41-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:11:41):**  There's a kind of temperate, a band of temperate latitudes in the Northern hemisphere.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:11:48):**  So it would probably be like from 30 to 40 degrees latitude to something like down to  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:11:57):**  25, something like that.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:12:01):**  Anyway, so all the way from far Western Europe in the UK, you know, they've got the famous  
**[0:12:08-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:12:08):**  English oak and that's a very moist temperate, non-brittle climate.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:12:15):**  Although that English oak seems to be very, very happy to grow in Mediterranean climates  
**[0:12:22-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:12:22):**  as well and very closely related to and similar looking to other deciduous Mediterranean type  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:12:30):**  oaks like the Canary oak and those kind of oaks.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:12:35):**  And then you get these different forms of deciduous oak in Europe and Asia that are  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:12:45):**  very similar to each other in lots of ways and they kind of just run along this temperate  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:12:50):**  band and they change, you know, of course they change, they change in species, but they  
**[0:12:55-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:12:55):**  also hybridise readily.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:12:58):**  So a lot of the time you get this kind of, instead of just like a hard boundary between  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:13:04):**  two species of oak, you'll get like a blurring of genetics in between them.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:13:10):**  But then there are also the species of oak that grow in the relative dry lands.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:13:19):**  So for instance, one of my favourite things in the world, which anyone who's ever heard  
**[0:13:23-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:13:23):**  me rant about anything will be sick of hearing about, that's the dahisa in Spain.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:13:30):**  So the dahisa systems or montado systems in Portuguese is 4 million hectares of semi-domesticated  
**[0:13:40-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:13:40):**  oak savannah in Spain and Portugal and a little bit in Greece, I believe as well.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:13:46):**  And those oak overstand a grassland upon which agriculturalists run their stock animals.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:13:58):**  And then they will grow certain crops within the pasture land as well.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:14:03):**  But largely it's for the raising of stock animals, cattle, in fact the merino sheep,  
**[0:14:13-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:14:13):**  which is so famous in Australia, is native to that region of Spain from the dahisa.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:14:22):**  The oak species there are Quercus suba, which is the cork oak, which is famous for its bark,  
**[0:14:33-0:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:14:33):**  its thick spongy bark, which is most commonly known to create the corks in wine bottles,  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:14:41):**  which has been phased out obviously in the last 10 or so years with the screw top bottles.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:14:45):**  But cork has a million other applications and I believe it's making a comeback.  
**[0:14:53-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:14:53):**  Anyway, the cork has plenty of applications like flooring and they make a kind of faux  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:15:02):**  leather out of it for bags and clothing and stuff.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:15:07):**  Oh my gosh, it would be great to replace pleather with cork.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:15:10):**  Yeah, well I think it's going to be huge.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:15:14):**  I think cork products are one big marketing push away from making a serious comeback.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:15:23):**  Cork flooring is amazing.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:15:24):**  I don't know if anyone's ever walked on cork floors.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:15:28):**  I worked at a green living store probably 20 years ago and they were selling cork tiles  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:15:33):**  and it's so quiet and nice and soft and peaceful.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:15:38):**  Yeah, and insulation for roofs.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:15:41):**  I mean I've had a video somewhere on my hard drive where I drove through the world's largest  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:15:47):**  cork plantation in northern Morocco.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:15:53):**  So there's a lot of these systems kind of sitting around dormant.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:15:57):**  I wrote a post about this just the other day that in the global financial crisis of 2008  
**[0:16:06-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:16:06):**  to deal with, to fight back from the economic conditions they found themselves in, Spain  
**[0:16:13-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:16:13):**  and Portugal got very, very creative with investing in and augmenting certain industries  
**[0:16:22-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:16:22):**  and one of them was the eco-agricultural tourism and they rebooted their commitment to land  
**[0:16:33-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:16:33):**  stewardship for the de jesa so they kind of protected it and established maintenance programs  
**[0:16:40-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:16:40):**  and now they're rebooting their cork economy.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:16:44):**  And I mean this system has so many extra yields of honey and high quality premium animal products.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:16:55):**  The pork that comes from these systems from where the pigs eat the acorns is I believe  
**[0:17:03-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:17:03):**  the highest priced animal product, food product in Europe below beluga caviar and honey and  
**[0:17:13-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:17:13):**  then the whole ecological aspect like hiking tours and bird watching and hunting and then  
**[0:17:21-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:17:21):**  the agricultural like foodie tourism of people coming to see the old traditional methods  
**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:17:29):**  of doing this and that.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:17:31):**  So yeah that's really promising and it's part of the rewilding Europe program where they're  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:17:36):**  fostering the breeding of Iberian lynx.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:17:41):**  I mean these systems are just a die for.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:17:44):**  If people want to see a really beautiful video on my website there's a tab, sorry in the  
**[0:17:51-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:17:51):**  article section of my website which is oatreedesigns.com.au there's an article called de jesa australis  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:17:59):**  and near the top of that article there's this video and it's a kind of five minute clip  
**[0:18:04-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:18:04):**  of just drone footage and whatnot of the de jesa and it's very very beautiful.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:18:11):**  It's what I would like every agricultural landscape to look like give or take.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:18:17):**  And so basically the de jesa then if I'm getting this right because I haven't really heard  
**[0:18:21-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:18:21):**  of it until I did some research for this interview.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:18:24):**  So is it like a semi-domesticated kind of savannah landscape where you're working with  
**[0:18:30-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:18:30):**  the trees that are there or do you plant the trees or how does that work?  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:18:33):**  Well that's right so it's semi-domesticated because of its scale it's so damn huge the  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:18:39):**  management of it becomes very hands-off.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:18:44):**  You know you can't intensively manage four million hectares so it does become semi-domesticated,  
**[0:18:50-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:18:50):**  semi-wild so it's used for humans, humans use it but it is semi-wild as well and you  
**[0:18:57-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:18:57):**  know it's semi-wild when you have apex predators like I know they have lynx I don't know if  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:19:03):**  there's wolf or bear or anything in there I don't think there's bear in the Iberian  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:19:08):**  peninsula except maybe through the Pyrenees but that's a different discussion.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:19:13):**  But yes so it's thousands of years old they've done different pollen research and they've  
**[0:19:23-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:19:23):**  they realize that it's been around in some form for I think four thousand years and you  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:19:30):**  know I think once upon a time there was more like the grapes growing there and there was  
**[0:19:34-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:19:34):**  more this and less that but it's been in its current something like its current form on  
**[0:19:40-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:19:40):**  and off for four thousand years I believe if I remember correctly.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:19:44):**  I'll pause quickly to point people to a really great book called if anyone's interested in  
**[0:19:50-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:19:50):**  oak this is like the quintessential oak nerd book with like a really great balance of science  
**[0:19:56-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:19:56):**  and narrative and just interesting historical tidbits it's called Oak the framing of civilization  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:20:05):**  by a chap called something Logan I've gone blank.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:20:11):**  Mr Logan?  
**[0:20:13-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:20:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:20:14):**  Okay that's that's a good title it encompasses a lot.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:20:19):**  Yeah and it really does go into amazing detail about oak all the way back to the beginning  
**[0:20:24-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:20:24):**  um so yeah the de hesa they manage it largely it's the management is is the way the animals  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:20:34):**  move are moved through there has a lot to do with how it's managed you know in a in  
**[0:20:40-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:20:40):**  a kind of holistic management and intensive rotational grazing way they it's so big that  
**[0:20:47-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:20:47):**  they can move animals through in a certain way that allows the grasslands to recover  
**[0:20:55-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:20:55):**  and then there is management of the cork system so I believe a cork tree will start yielding  
**[0:21:02-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:21:02):**  after about 15 to 20, 25 years and they they harvest the bark on a nine year cycle.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:21:11):**  There's wildfire which is a natural occurrence in all Mediterranean climate regions and has  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:21:19):**  been a part of fire stick agricultural you know the land stewarding techniques of traditional  
**[0:21:25-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:21:25):**  peoples in in many places around the world and I believe that it's used as a management  
**[0:21:32-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:21:32):**  tool currently and then there's um to allow for the regeneration of of oak I believe they  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:21:42):**  there's these in fact I'm ordering some in now I'm in talks with this company in Spain  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:21:47):**  about um setting up a trade partnership to get them to Australia they're called protector  
**[0:21:52-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:21:52):**  cactus tree guards and they're they're awesome they're like a galvanized steel cage with  
**[0:22:01-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:22:01):**  spikes sticking out so the the the the stock animals don't go anywhere near it and allows  
**[0:22:08-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:22:08):**  these baby trees to grow into big trees happily and then you can like lift them up so the  
**[0:22:15-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:22:15):**  bottom is exposed and then the the stock animals will do all the like weed whacking and lawn  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:22:21):**  mowing around the bottom and they're really neat I like them and so is this something  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:22:26):**  that um it's mostly oak that the de asa is usually an oak kind of woodland or is it other  
**[0:22:32-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:22:32):**  trees as well uh I mean in terms of the the canopy the established canopy I mean first  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:22:39):**  let's start with off with savannah like so what what is the biome of the de jesus it's  
**[0:22:45-0:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:22:45):**  a savannah so a biome is the name we give to describe certain ecological communities  
**[0:22:53-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:22:53):**  and the dynamics that they create and you can have diff you can have uh the same biome  
**[0:23:00-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:23:00):**  around the world with different species look so like a desert is a biome and there's plenty  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:23:09):**  of deserts with different species around the world but they've got characteristic similarities  
**[0:23:13-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:23:13):**  and wetlands are biomes etc etc so the savannah is a grassland system which is forested very  
**[0:23:23-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:23:23):**  lightly so I like you know anywhere from kind of like a tree every 20 30 40 50 60 70 meters  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:23:37):**  so that's about like I think eight a hectare eight eight trees a hectare or something like  
**[0:23:41-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:23:41):**  that and savannahs are often the result of an environment where you have a strong trophic  
**[0:23:52-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:23:52):**  um where your trophic levels are all occupied what up up to the point where you have large  
**[0:24:00-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:24:00):**  grazing herbivores and the predators that prey upon them so I won't go too far into  
**[0:24:06-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:24:06):**  how it gets there but it does and a good example would be the oak sorry the savannahs of um  
**[0:24:13-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:24:13):**  like the Serengeti in Africa where you've got these big plain grass plains and then  
**[0:24:18-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:24:18):**  you've got acacia trees popping up out of them so this so the dejesus is the savannah  
**[0:24:25-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:24:25):**  of grasslands over stood by oak species the cork we've spoken about the other one is Quercus  
**[0:24:31-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:24:31):**  Ilex which is the Holm oak which in many ways is very similar to the cork but it it doesn't  
**[0:24:37-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:24:37):**  have that bark but they're both evergreen oaks and they've both got kind of prickly  
**[0:24:43-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:24:43):**  leaves Quercus Ilex has particularly prickly leaves and Ilex is the Latin name for holly  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:24:50):**  and so their leaves actually resemble the holly the prickly holly leaves those two trees  
**[0:24:56-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:24:56):**  they represent the vast majority of the climax canopy species in that savannah system there  
**[0:25:03-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:25:03):**  may be others I'm not familiar with them if there are in terms of the canopy species but  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:25:10):**  there's plenty of understory like it's a whole it's a whole complete more or less complete  
**[0:25:16-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:25:16):**  ecological trophic system with your I mean savannahs are characteristically the two standout

**[0:36:40-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:36:40):**  no maintenance or management after that um dropping tons upon tons of high quality staple

**[0:36:56-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:36:56):**  any acorns raw you have to prepare them right and leach out um tannins i believe that's  
**[0:37:01-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:37:01):**  that's right so it's a question of the tannins i believe that's about it so tannins are hydrocarbon  
**[0:37:09-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:37:09):**  um a family of hydrocarbon molecules very common as secondary compounds in plants um  
**[0:37:19-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:37:19):**  i think they're used to deter um herbivory and they've they've got some like immune immune  
**[0:37:28-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:37:28):**  functions for the plant and whatnot but when a mammal eats too many tannins it in i believe  
**[0:37:36-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:37:36):**  it inhibits the digestion of proteins and becomes toxic some animals can handle more  
**[0:37:43-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:37:43):**  than others like a pig can handle a fair bit and in fact most animals benefit from some

**[0:37:55-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:37:55):**  so there are so virtually all acorns need some degree of processing and it would involve  
**[0:38:02-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:38:02):**  something along the lines of collecting the acorns roasting them shelling them um crushing  
**[0:38:10-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:38:10):**  them and then leaching the crushed acorn in fresh water for a few days so that the tannins  
**[0:38:19-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:38:19):**  which are water soluble leach out and once you've got once you've done all that you're

**[0:38:52-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:38:52):**  you'd add salts or honey or sweetener or something but what it what it is also famous for is

**[0:39:18-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:39:18):**  i've heard and my personal experience is that you can eat some of this stuff and it'll keep  
**[0:39:22-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:39:22):**  you going for a very long time it'll it'll it'll it's light it doesn't make you feel  
**[0:39:29-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:39:29):**  over full or heavy like if you ate cake or something um but that it'll keep you going

**[0:39:39-0:39:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:39:39):**  seen the movie most people have here read the books too yeah okay yeah me too um there  
**[0:39:46-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:39:46):**  was the elven bread so when when the the hobbits went through lothlorien they were gifted a  
**[0:39:54-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:39:54):**  bunch of things by these elves including these these elven breads or elven cakes and uh they  
**[0:40:02-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:40:02):**  kept they were very light and crumbly and they were full of energy and kept them going  
**[0:40:08-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:40:08):**  all day and i've read that it suggested that tolkien was actually making a reference to  
**[0:40:14-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:40:14):**  oak bread through that yeah yeah if it's good enough for galadriel it's good enough for  
**[0:40:22-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:40:22):**  me um so acorns then they're reliable abundant and are they storable do they store well if  
**[0:40:28-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:40:28):**  you have this huge crop they do and um yes that's right from my understanding okay so  
**[0:40:36-0:40:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:40:36):**  so back to the tannins there are within the oak genus the quercus genus there's all these  
**[0:40:43-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:40:43):**  different species and the tannin levels of the acorns throughout those species varies  
**[0:40:49-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:40:49):**  a lot and then it can also vary within species of different varieties in fact like part of  
**[0:40:55-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:40:55):**  the dahisa australis project is about finding recognizing all of the best tree crops for  
**[0:41:04-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:41:04):**  um dahisa analogs and within the oak genus that's looking for good species of oak that  
**[0:41:14-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:41:14):**  are precocious and that you know they have a high yield and they're hardy and da da da  
**[0:41:20-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:41:20):**  and the ones that are low tannin there there are rumors of these these these oak species  
**[0:41:26-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:41:26):**  or particular trees or varieties within a species that are so low in tannins that you  
**[0:41:33-0:41:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:41:33):**  can just pick up an acorn off the ground and eat it like a chestnut wow so there's like  
**[0:41:38-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:41:38):**  a collection of acorns like my kind of top five low tannin acorns are from quercus ilex  
**[0:41:46-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:41:46):**  the hom oak quercus suba the cork oak quercus bicolor the swamp white oak quercus alba the

**[0:42:03-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:42:03):**  thing with tannins is that yes you can store them and my understanding is that the indigenous  
**[0:42:09-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:42:09):**  peoples of any balanna cultures they would prepare the acorns of the species with low  
**[0:42:16-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:42:16):**  tannins in that season and then they would store the acorns of higher tannin species  
**[0:42:25-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:42:25):**  for seasons to come because tannins are also a preservative so the higher tannins acorns  
**[0:42:34-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:42:34):**  would be stored in in uh caches and okay like you know packed in mud or clay and stored  
**[0:42:42-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:42:42):**  underground in a cool place and and occasionally you find you know you have archaeological  
**[0:42:48-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:42:48):**  digs and they'll find caches of of acorns you know through the americas and you know  
**[0:42:54-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:42:54):**  japan and korea a couple of years ago there was these big acorn caches discovered in korea  
**[0:43:00-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:43:00):**  and yeah it's fascinating it is i know oaks are long lived so what a valuable food crop  
**[0:43:09-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:43:09):**  um if you have this tree living for hundreds of years well that's where you know like i  
**[0:43:14-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:43:14):**  feel like my personal totem is the oak tree because of its abundance and its robustness  
**[0:43:21-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:43:21):**  and all of this like these values that i really value and then i realized that the oak savannah  
**[0:43:30-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:43:30):**  the dahisa like to have an entire broad acre landscape established to oak savannah that's  
**[0:43:40-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:43:40):**  kind of totemic and symbolic toward the kind of human environment i want to help create  
**[0:43:47-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:43:47):**  or at least i just want to see i want to be in i want to live in that kind of place or  
**[0:43:52-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:43:52):**  close to it you know to have those kind of systems are the very kinds of systems that  
**[0:44:00-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:44:00):**  embody the wisdom of of a people that you know gets its foundations right first and  
**[0:44:11-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:44:11):**  thinks ahead in in you know multi-generational terms and um yeah and and they're just beautiful  
**[0:44:20-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:44:20):**  as well these semi-domesticated places you know like they're i've spoken about this before  
**[0:44:28-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:44:28):**  that to me it's like i don't want to be i don't i'm not i'm not a very urbane dweller  
**[0:44:34-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:44:34):**  like i don't like being in cities but i don't like being in wilderness for too long either  
**[0:44:40-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:44:40):**  like that's not our home that's not where we're from humans are a keystone species and  
**[0:44:46-0:44:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:44:46):**  we create our environment we affect it like the way a beaver does it actually creates

**[0:45:06-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:45:06):**  forgotten regenerative principles um so like you know the human impact on the environment  
**[0:45:13-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:45:13):**  doesn't have to be a bad thing it can be incredibly positive so long as we remember these regenerative  
**[0:45:19-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:45:19):**  regenerative principles and the landscapes that we create when we do that are by default  
**[0:45:27-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:45:27):**  our they feel good they look good that's where we want to be and the de jesus is like the  
**[0:45:34-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:45:34):**  the de jesus as a semi-domesticated broad scale oak savannah to me is just the perfect  
**[0:45:40-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:45:40):**  example of that it's like a human environment that still incorporates the best of wilderness  
**[0:45:49-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:45:49):**  and it's the best of humans too right applying our impact to something that is life-giving  
**[0:45:54-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:45:54):**  and regenerative correct yeah agreed and how long do oak trees live usually does it i'm  
**[0:46:02-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:46:02):**  sure it's a range some of the larger trees you can live for hundreds of years and if  
**[0:46:09-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:46:09):**  you coppice them it extends their lifetime interesting and because in england because  
**[0:46:17-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:46:17):**  they england is an island they had to manage their forestry systems very very well you  
**[0:46:24-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:46:24):**  know they had they recognized relatively early that they had finite forestry resources so  
**[0:46:30-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:46:30):**  they they developed these systems like of like the hedgerow systems where their land  
**[0:46:37-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:46:37):**  was partitioned off from one another each parcel was partitioned by a hedgerow which  
**[0:46:43-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:46:43):**  was like a living fence of all different species that would provide all sorts of yields including  
**[0:46:48-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:46:48):**  firewood and food and whatnot although the history has more to do with the church and  
**[0:46:54-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:46:54):**  and whatnot but anyway the other systems are like the coppice agroforestry systems rotational  
**[0:47:00-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:47:00):**  coppice systems where you'd have like a stand of or forest and you'd have like you know  
**[0:47:08-0:47:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:47:08):**  eight or so oak per hectare and they would be grown to these big beautiful tall saw logs  
**[0:47:17-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:47:17):**  and then underneath them you'd have chestnut coming up and underneath them you'd have something  
**[0:47:21-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:47:21):**  else and they were all worked together in this beautiful coppice system mosaic rotational  
**[0:47:27-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:47:27):**  coppice system and uh doing so the coppicing of those trees somehow extends their life  
**[0:47:35-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:47:35):**  it kind of hits a reset button and you can have a tree growing five times older than  
**[0:47:40-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:47:40):**  it would otherwise.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:47:42):**  So that would be a really valuable technique to replicate?  
**[0:47:46-0:47:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:47:46):**  Oh it's it's yeah it we should be paying more attention to it and I'd point people toward  
**[0:47:50-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:47:50):**  the work of Ben Law who wrote the book The Woodland Way and other associated releases  
**[0:47:57-0:48:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:47:57):**  he's a coppice chestnut he a coppice worker forestry worker traditional technique on a  
**[0:48:03-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:48:03):**  chestnut plantation in England.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:48:06):**  So Byron what about medicinal uses of oak do you know what part of the tree is used  
**[0:48:12-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:48:12):**  medicinally and tell us a bit about that?  
**[0:48:15-0:48:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:48:15):**  The tannins like it's mostly the tannins I don't know about the medicine so much but  
**[0:48:21-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:48:21):**  oak were said to be this tree that yields three fruit and the so you got the timber  
**[0:48:28-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:48:28):**  and the three fruit of the oak so the one fruit obviously is the acorn but then the  
**[0:48:35-0:48:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:48:35):**  second fruit are the gall of the oak right so you've got these galls which is kind of  
**[0:48:42-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:48:42):**  like a plant's response to a pathogen like an insect or a wasp or something laying its  
**[0:48:48-0:48:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:48:48):**  eggs in it it's like kind of like almost like scar tissue that builds up around the the  
**[0:48:53-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:48:53):**  infection and in oaks these galls become highly concentrated with tannins and so much so that  
**[0:49:05-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:49:05):**  they were used for extracting tannins and they're also used for creating ink so they  
**[0:49:13-0:49:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:49:13):**  had this kind of black dark ink that they would use to write with their quills.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:49:21):**  I should also add as well that there are other species of acorn like the Quercus macrolepsis  
**[0:49:27-0:49:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:49:27):**  which is really interesting people should check that out the Quercus macrolepsis have  
**[0:49:31-0:49:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:49:31):**  a look at the the cap on the acorn it's just incredible it really it quite clearly shows  
**[0:49:38-0:49:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:49:38):**  the potential of its relationship to a chestnut so it's kind of like a big spiky burr that  
**[0:49:44-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:49:44):**  the spikes aren't sharp they're kind of flat but those it's funny because the macrolepsis  
**[0:49:50-0:49:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:49:50):**  acorn is one of the best low tannin acorns as well I should have added that to my list  
**[0:49:56-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:49:56):**  earlier but the cap is so high in tannins that it's used it was used to leach tannins  
**[0:50:03-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:50:03):**  from to tan leather and whatnot.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:50:06):**  That's amazing and I know oak galls too I'm actually collecting some or was and you can  
**[0:50:12-0:50:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:50:12):**  use them for natural dyeing and as a mordant so it helps the dye set into the fabric.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:50:18):**  I see yes okay and then you've got the third fruit of the oak and I used to notice this  
**[0:50:28-0:50:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:50:28):**  on my the oak I grew up in so I forget what time of year it is I think it's late summer  
**[0:50:32-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:50:32):**  you get these sugars accumulating on the leaves and people would you know like have you ever  
**[0:50:40-0:50:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:50:40):**  touched a deciduous oak leaf and it's kind of sticky but it's kind of like a sugary kind  
**[0:50:45-0:50:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:50:45):**  of like honey maple syrupy veneer on these leaves and people would take the leaves and  
**[0:50:54-0:50:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:50:54):**  soak the leaves in water to make a kind of sugary water and then they'd you know drink  
**[0:50:58-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:50:58):**  it or make an alcoholic beverage out of it.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:51:00):**  In fact oak leaf wine was pretty common as well but no I don't think it was from those  
**[0:51:06-0:51:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:51:06):**  those sugars oak leaf wine was they would pick the young spring leaves with lots of  
**[0:51:14-0:51:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:51:14):**  sugars in them and use them to make wines out of.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:51:18):**  I never have heard about that.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:51:20):**  So Byron another aspect of oaks that we haven't touched on is this symbolism or the cultural  
**[0:51:27-0:51:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:51:27):**  significance of these trees.  
**[0:51:30-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:51:30):**  Could you share some of that with our listeners today?  
**[0:51:34-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:51:34):**  Yeah well I'm not sure what the symbolism how the symbolism extends outside of Europe  
**[0:51:43-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:51:43):**  but I wouldn't be surprised if it was very similar but the like I mentioned before oaks  
**[0:51:51-0:52:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:51:51):**  in traditional European symbolism have long symbolized robustness and abundance you know  
**[0:52:02-0:52:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:52:02):**  this ability this the grand oak the old oak this kind of like immutable unmovable force  
**[0:52:12-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:52:12):**  with its deep roots in the ground this ancientness this kind of like king of the forest kind  
**[0:52:18-0:52:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:52:18):**  of vibe in ruled by Jupiter in those astrological systems of correspondence it's ruled by Jupiter  
**[0:52:28-0:52:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:52:28):**  it's like it's good luck it's very positive it provides it's bountiful.  
**[0:52:35-0:52:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:52:35):**  And wisdom I think too right like yeah wise oaks.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:52:39):**  Yeah from its age and an association with Jupiter and Zeus and Thor because of it being  
**[0:52:47-0:52:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:52:47):**  struck by lightning so often.  
**[0:52:51-0:53:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:52:51):**  So yeah and the druids like the pre it's fascinating we have to understand that pre-Christian  
**[0:53:00-0:53:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:53:00):**  Europe where a tree worshiping might not be the right word but what revering culture and  
**[0:53:10-0:53:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:53:10):**  that the ogham which is the 22 letter sacred alphabet of the what we call druidic cultic  
**[0:53:17-0:53:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:53:17):**  cultures each 22 letters was named for a tree the oak just being one of them but druid actually  
**[0:53:29-0:53:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:53:29):**  means Daru with which is Daru is one of the Indo-European root words for what we call  
**[0:53:37-0:53:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:53:37):**  oak and is also I think etymologically linked to the word door so Daru is oak and with means  
**[0:53:46-0:53:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:53:46):**  one who knows so the druids the Daruids those who know the oak these sacred groves throughout  
**[0:53:55-0:54:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:53:55):**  pre-Christian Europe you know they were the churches of the ancestors of European peoples.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:54:04):**  The European peoples were as indigenous as anyone before the before the Romans come along  
**[0:54:10-0:54:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:54:10):**  I would I direct people to a book written by a woman called Lye De Angelis that's her  
**[0:54:17-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:54:17):**  name it's L Y is her first name and then De Angelis D E Angelis like Los Angeles and she  
**[0:54:26-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:54:26):**  wrote a book called Prittani P R I T E N I and that is the root word of Britain and it's  
**[0:54:34-0:54:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:54:34):**  about the Roman conquest of Britain and gives an idea of the type of people that that they're  
**[0:54:42-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:54:42):**  British and very likely much of the Western European people Celtic peoples and Teutonic  
**[0:54:49-0:54:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:54:49):**  peoples the Germanic Teutons in the north northwest were before the Roman conquest it's  
**[0:54:58-0:55:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:54:58):**  all tied together you know you've got this this growing appreciation for that as well  
**[0:55:03-0:55:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:55:03):**  at the moment I'm noticing around the world under the European the European collective  
**[0:55:10-0:55:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:55:10):**  identities asking itself who are we and what were we before and what was this big event  
**[0:55:17-0:55:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:55:17):**  that changed us and yeah so that kind of to me the oak is a symbol of our indigenousness  
**[0:55:27-0:55:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:55:27):**  as Western European people and the nobility that comes along with that and of course you  
**[0:55:37-0:55:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:55:37):**  know you can have a people who are very very deeply connected to their landscape and incredibly  
**[0:55:48-0:55:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:55:48):**  learned you know and and appreciating higher learning and higher wisdom in the forms of

**[0:56:28-0:56:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:56:28):**  represent and using them to move forward like to me that they are the symbol of the type  
**[0:56:33-0:56:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:56:33):**  of systems that I would like humanity to see implementing and like for instance I just  
**[0:56:40-0:56:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/byron-joel-on-the-fascinating-coevolution-of-humans-and-oak-trees/#t=0:56:40):**  I was just watching TV this morning and there's a Australian scientific science program called

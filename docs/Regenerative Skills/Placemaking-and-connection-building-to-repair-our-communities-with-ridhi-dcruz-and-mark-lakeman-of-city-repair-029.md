**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:01:25):**  Alright, I have an extra special interview for all of you today.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:01:29):**  In this episode I've got not one, but two visionary changemakers from the community  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:01:34):**  restoration non-profit City Repair, which is based in Portland, Oregon.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:01:39):**  I've got Riddhi D'Cruise, the Village Coalition organizer, and the founder of City Repair,  
**[0:01:44-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:01:44):**  Mark Lakeman.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:01:46):**  They each come from very different backgrounds, but have united to foster thriving, inclusive,  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:01:51):**  and sustainable communities through the creative reclamation of public space.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:01:56):**  City Repair also facilitates artistic and ecologically oriented placemaking through  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:01):**  projects that honor the interconnection of human communities and the natural world.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:06):**  Now I know that all sounds a bit complicated, but what's really worth knowing is that a  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:10):**  large part of their projects involve permaculture garden installations and community spaces  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:15):**  built with natural materials, all in urban environments where those types of projects  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:19):**  have traditionally been hard to get approved.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:22):**  In this interview, Mark and Riddhi go in depth about the concept of placemaking and why it's  
**[0:02:27-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:27):**  so essential in our modern communities.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:30):**  Mark gives incredible insights on the history of colonial advancement through the Americas  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:34):**  and how it's shaped the landscape and our environment into one that isolates us from  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:39):**  one another.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:40):**  Riddhi goes on to explain their annual event called the Village Building Convergence and  
**[0:02:44-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:44):**  how their work has already had an amazing impact on the interconnectedness of people  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:48):**  that they've worked with in unexpected ways.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:52):**  At the end, both of them give invaluable advice on how you can take up the mantle and effectively  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:57):**  create and facilitate connections in your own community.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:03:01):**  The answers may surprise you.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:03:03):**  But before I give anything away, I'll turn things over to Riddhi D'Cruz and Mark Lakeman.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:03:07):**  Alright, I'm joined here today by Mark Lakeman and Riddhi D'Cruz.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:03:12):**  Thank you so much for being here today.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:03:15):**  Thanks for having me.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:03:16):**  You're welcome, Oliver.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:03:17):**  Before we jump into all the questions, how about starting with Riddhi?  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:03:20):**  Could you both introduce yourselves just a little and tell us a little bit about your  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:03:24):**  backgrounds and how you came to work with City Repair?  
**[0:03:28-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:03:28):**  Okay.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:03:29):**  I first heard about City Repair in India from a co-participant in a natural building workshop.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:03:42):**  I told him that I had been considering grad school in Portland.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:03:46):**  There were just various things that were drawing me towards Oregon, mostly awesome people who  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:03:53):**  had the spirit of the forest in their step in India.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:03:57):**  And so yeah, he said, Oh, wow, you're going to Portland.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:04:01):**  Have you heard of City Repair?  
**[0:04:02-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:04:02):**  And I was like, no.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:04:04):**  And then he said, Oh, my gosh, it's right up your alley.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:04:08):**  And sure enough, I looked it up and, you know, I was painting walls with friends in India  
**[0:04:13-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:04:13):**  to kind of as a response to rapid urbanization in my city and what I thought was the commoditization  
**[0:04:21-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:04:21):**  of relationships.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:04:22):**  Like everything was transactional and money oriented and disorienting for me growing up  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:04:29):**  in a more place-based culture.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:04:32):**  So I feel like that and a series of other decisions and choices led to me ending up  
**[0:04:42-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:04:42):**  in Portland and yeah, and then it was inevitable that I would get involved with City Repair.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:04:50):**  And I did grad school in anthropology.  
**[0:04:53-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:04:53):**  And also part of why I chose Portland was to understand how urban planning and sustainability  
**[0:05:03-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:03):**  can work in ways to ensure that we have a life that's both justice oriented, but also  
**[0:05:15-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:15):**  that's and to people and to the planet as well, you know, so kind of well rounded.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:22):**  And I'm finding my exploration and that continues outside of school.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:29):**  And there's a lot of work to be done.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:30):**  You know, I know that many people consider Portland a model.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:34):**  I also challenge that because I feel like there are ways that my background in India  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:40):**  and my upbringing and my culture and other cultures have are very vital in informing  
**[0:05:46-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:46):**  what we have going here.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:48):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:49):**  That's a lovely story and very serendipitous.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:51):**  How about you, Mark?  
**[0:05:53-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:53):**  Well, let's see.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:55):**  I like to I like to kind of give credit to people who have been involved in activism  
**[0:06:03-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:06:03):**  long before us, because part of my role in helping to get City Repair going back in the  
**[0:06:10-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:06:10):**  mid 90s was to kind of gather ideas and sort of even, you might say, threads of of culture  
**[0:06:20-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:06:20):**  and of of initiatives that were already underway and try to kind of, I would say, restate them  
**[0:06:30-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:06:30):**  in a way where where things were kind of brought together into maybe a new iteration or a new  
**[0:06:37-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:06:37):**  version.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:06:38):**  So, you know, we've been doing what you might call placemaking now in Portland for a while  
**[0:06:45-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:06:45):**  to birth participatory culture and to reclaim space and transform it into gathering places  
**[0:06:54-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:06:54):**  for community beginning most, I think, dramatically with Pioneer Square.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:07:02):**  So I, you know, in a way City Repair began officially with the efforts in the mid 90s,  
**[0:07:09-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:07:09):**  but really the parts and pieces that make it up were all created by other people.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:07:15):**  I mean, just like a poet invents a poem, they're still using structures and language that were  
**[0:07:22-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:07:22):**  invented by others and in many ways, metaphors that have been been tried before.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:07:27):**  So I think, you know, the ongoing cause of, you know, creating a more a more place based  
**[0:07:35-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:07:35):**  social justice oriented culture has been going on for a very, very long time.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:07:41):**  In fact, it's probably the basis of of human culture, of human habitat.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:07:46):**  You know, we like to all talk about villages because we identify with them so strongly  
**[0:07:53-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:07:53):**  because of the way that working and living is integrated.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:07:56):**  And I think so, you know, I think that what we've been doing and what what I helped contribute  
**[0:08:03-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:08:03):**  to in the mid 90s was to try to restore the value of a village in Portland and then and  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:08:12):**  then try to create a model that would inspire other people.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:08:15):**  And then I think that's what what really heard about the rest of what I'll say is just that  
**[0:08:21-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:08:21):**  I think if we were smart about anything back then in the mid 90s, it was that we knew that  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:08:27):**  we didn't know everything and that what we had to create had to be open ended and essentially  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:08:33):**  complimentary so that when Riddhi arrived, we became more complete.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:08:38):**  Just like everyone else who steps into city repair, we we start to learn more and know  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:08:43):**  more about what we're trying to do as everyone arrives and adds their their piece.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:08:48):**  I really like that way of explaining it as a multi-level collaboration for those who  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:08:52):**  came before and those who keep continuing to join and add to the whole.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:08:56):**  Now, you mentioned a concept called placemaking.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:08:59):**  Could you talk a little bit about this concept and what does it mean to each of you?  
**[0:09:04-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:04):**  And why is it so important to our communities these days?  
**[0:09:08-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:08):**  Riddhi, do you want to start on that?  
**[0:09:10-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:10):**  OK. The way I look at it, Oliver, is, you know, I'm kind of annoyed.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:18):**  I'm going to out myself in that, but I'll try to bridge it.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:21):**  I look at colonization in terms of time and space compression, one component of it.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:29):**  And what that means is that it like time becomes a commodity.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:35):**  Like, you know, it's like, oh, I got to work to earn money to live this life or I don't  
**[0:09:40-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:40):**  have time to go into the woods.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:42):**  I don't have time.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:43):**  All this busy stuff, right?  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:45):**  Like trying to keep keep up and then space as well.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:49):**  At least in Portland, we're seeing this more and more where free space or unutilized space  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:58):**  or things that are of just public benefit are getting less and less because there's  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:10:04):**  so much, it's prime real estate.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:10:07):**  So land is getting privatized and commoditized in a really intense way.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:10:13):**  And what that creates for a human being and a human experience is, I think, this kind  
**[0:10:20-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:10:20):**  of fractured, frenetic and disorienting experience.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:10:28):**  And so for me, placemaking is at the spiritual level, it's answering the question, like,  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:10:36):**  what is my place in this universe, in this life in relation to other life?  
**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:10:41):**  So there's that component.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:10:43):**  And then it's also kind of working to reclaim my place, like physically the land and my  
**[0:10:51-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:10:51):**  time and how I inhabit my life in the more material sense from ways that it has been  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:00):**  taken away or kind of constrained and forced into certain ways and like life practices  
**[0:11:06-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:06):**  that I don't find conducive to my spirit.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:10):**  And to our collective spirit.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:11):**  So that to me is the two levels I see placemaking operating at.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:16):**  Excellent.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:18):**  And Mark?  
**[0:11:20-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:20):**  Well, I'd start off by agreeing with Riddhi that especially in the American context or  
**[0:11:26-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:26):**  Western hemispheric context of colonialism, placemaking has to be understood in that context.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:35):**  So, you know, let's see, I want to be able to give a simple definition, though.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:41):**  I'll just try by saying placemaking is the restoration of participation at the local  
**[0:11:48-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:48):**  level.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:49):**  You could say that.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:51):**  And so to contrast that with colonialism, what we find typically in American neighborhoods  
**[0:11:57-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:57):**  is that very strangely, unlike the thousands and thousands of years of otherwise human  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:12:07):**  history, in American neighborhoods, we find that we don't have power where we live to  
**[0:12:12-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:12:12):**  make decisions together, or at least that's how it seems.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:12:16):**  And we don't have gathering places commonly.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:12:19):**  Living within colonialism has resulted in the fact that American neighborhoods are  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:12:25):**  characteristically merely developments created for profit by developers.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:12:31):**  So we live in their economic and mental landscape, the void of their spiritual landscape.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:12:38):**  And this is expressed particularly by the absence of gathering places in American communities,  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:12:46):**  in Western hemispheric communities, but especially in the United States, where we actually have  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:12:51):**  the lowest number of community gathering places of all First World nations.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:12:56):**  And because of that isolation, we've been able to establish not just those of us who  
**[0:13:02-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:13:02):**  do placemaking, but academics and sociologists, anthropologists, public health officials,  
**[0:13:10-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:13:10):**  and researchers have been able to establish that so many of our dystopic kind of, but  
**[0:13:18-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:13:18):**  normative kind of patterns of life in American communities are resulting from our isolation.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:13:26):**  So we have about 10 times higher crime rates across the board than countries that we have  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:13:32):**  so much to do with that our ancestors came from or that we trade with economically or  
**[0:13:37-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:13:37):**  we interact with politically.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:13:39):**  We have 10 times higher crime rates across the board.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:13:42):**  We literally kill each other and rape each other and steal from each other more freely  
**[0:13:46-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:13:46):**  and we're killing each other more frequently.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:13:49):**  And there's reasons for this.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:13:51):**  It's not just something about the wild American character.  
**[0:13:54-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:13:54):**  It's that those countries that we might identify with as our own ancestral base, largely were  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:01):**  created, those landscapes were created by the people that inhabit them as a way of simply  
**[0:14:06-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:06):**  meeting their needs.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:08):**  But in the USA, if you live in a neighborhood like say, especially a place like suburban  
**[0:14:13-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:13):**  bus, you're living in a vast tract of housing created for profit without even one bench  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:20):**  to sit on, maybe not even any bus service and certainly not a single public square because  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:26):**  it was all laid out for profit by a developer with an architect helping funded by a banker  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:32):**  and none of them interested in creating a public square because for one thing, it's  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:37):**  harder to sell that kind of thing to the community.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:40):**  And for another thing, you know, those sorts of interests don't want communities to have  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:47):**  a way, not just a social space, but a social organism.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:51):**  Like if you were trying to sell them a public square, they would have to get together in  
**[0:14:56-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:56):**  order to buy it.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:58):**  And the last thing that development culture wants is for us to get together.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:15:02):**  I mean, this isn't a new thing either.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:15:05):**  This is at the very, this is written into the National Land Ordinance of 1785, which  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:15:11):**  was when these kinds of patterns and practices were basically embedded in the history of  
**[0:15:16-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:15:16):**  our country.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:15:17):**  The idea that we would just simply grid off the continent all the way to the Pacific Ocean  
**[0:15:22-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:15:22):**  and decide that it would all be transformed in a negative way from being characterized  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:15:30):**  by the patterns and lives of native people who had lived there for thousands of years  
**[0:15:35-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:15:35):**  and instead to actually plan in that document to eliminate them, to reduce them, and then  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:15:43):**  to convert their commonly held land into a commodity that could be sold off in little  
**[0:15:49-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:15:49):**  parcels.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:15:50):**  So, I mean, the story goes on and on and on, but the fact is, you know, functionally speaking,  
**[0:15:56-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:15:56):**  it results in the lives that we live today being characterized by isolation and the highest  
**[0:16:02-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:02):**  rates of violence.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:03):**  And it's deeper than that.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:05):**  The kinds of phobias that we experience as individuals, the personal challenges that  
**[0:16:10-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:10):**  we have that seem insolvable are also very much rooted in this kind of approach to creating  
**[0:16:18-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:18):**  an anti-cultural condition for living.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:21):**  So placemaking has to take this into consideration, and it's not hard.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:28):**  If people are divided and isolated, and then you as a placemaker are working in a community  
**[0:16:33-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:33):**  knowing that it is their very nature to actually know each other and work together and solve  
**[0:16:38-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:38):**  their own problems, then you can know before you even get started that as soon as you get  
**[0:16:43-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:43):**  started, everybody's hearts are going to be opening.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:46):**  They're going to be having epiphanies.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:48):**  They're even going to be acting a little crazy because they won't be able to believe or understand  
**[0:16:53-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:53):**  how wonderful they are feeling.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:56):**  So as a placemaker, you're bringing people together into kind of a scale of an organism  
**[0:17:02-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:17:02):**  of community that used to characterize our lives for at least 100,000 years in a very  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:17:08):**  basic way, and that still forms the foundation of our nature.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:17:14):**  So I'll just stop there, but that's a bit of it.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:17:17):**  That's a bit of how we talk about it.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:17:19):**  Well, that's absolutely fascinating, and I agree, absolutely essential as well to creating  
**[0:17:26-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:17:26):**  healthy and vibrant communities.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:17:28):**  Now, for both of you, but especially Riddhi, having come from a culture and a place in  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:17:32):**  the world where community space is still highly valued and a very active part of life there,  
**[0:17:38-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:17:38):**  where do you draw some of your inspirations?  
**[0:17:41-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:17:41):**  And I guess for both of you, what informs the designs and the efforts that you make  
**[0:17:48-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:17:48):**  in order to recreate these essential and communal places in a city like Portland, Oregon?  
**[0:17:55-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:17:55):**  Well, Oliver, like one thing I want to say is like, you know, India is a subcontinent  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:18:03):**  and we've had lots of visitors, to put it one way.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:18:07):**  And then we were also colonized by the British, the Dutch, the French, the Portuguese.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:18:12):**  A lot of folks have come over.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:18:13):**  And so, you know, English is my first language.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:18:17):**  I grew up with a lot of privilege in terms of class.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:18:21):**  So I grew up Roman Catholic.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:18:23):**  So I'm going to throw that all in there because just to kind of paint a really complex picture  
**[0:18:32-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:18:32):**  of what's happening in India, where, yes, there's like definitely, I think, a lot of  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:18:39):**  like public space and we have banyan trees that I remember growing up and seeing people  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:18:44):**  congregating around in more rural parts of India.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:18:49):**  And at the same time, we also have a lot of Western ways and like, you know, I don't know,  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:18:56):**  it's just complicated to say where East and West divide and meet.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:02):**  Certainly in the modern times as well.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:05):**  Yeah, very complicated.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:06):**  And then, you know, the history is we, we had, we opened our market, we had a protectionist  
**[0:19:14-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:14):**  economy, then we opened it up in the 90s.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:17):**  And so then globalization came in a big way.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:20):**  And so, yeah, there's, there's a lot of factors.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:23):**  But I would say to get back to your question that, that one way that I try to design spaces  
**[0:19:33-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:33):**  is, you know, in the human realm, I try to look at what the different needs and voices  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:39):**  and perspectives are so that, you know, like truly looking at, like, does this work for  
**[0:19:44-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:44):**  me?  
**[0:19:45-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:45):**  Does this work for other people's needs?  
**[0:19:47-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:47):**  Like, what, what are we trying to do and accomplish?  
**[0:19:49-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:49):**  And how can people feel safe and be set up to thrive in some ways?  
**[0:19:55-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:55):**  Like, what's that happy medium?  
**[0:19:58-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:58):**  And then also looking at that for the non-human world, like, what does that mean for birds  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:20:05):**  and animals passing through, or just ecology and the environment in general?  
**[0:20:11-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:20:11):**  And then the other part, which might sound a little strange, or woo woo, as I sometimes  
**[0:20:20-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:20:20):**  hear people refer to it, but I think that if we listen, the like, sometimes I can get  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:20:27):**  a sense of what the land wants to be, you know, and it might be energetic, like, it's  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:20:32):**  just the way it's just, for lack of a better word, it's, it makes sense, you know, like,  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:20:37):**  oh yeah, this wants to be, this is where the shed should go.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:20:41):**  It just makes sense.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:20:42):**  So I don't know, I feel like there's, there's ways that you can, you can go to school for  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:20:48):**  some of these things, like for anthropology, for urban planning and things like that.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:20:54):**  And they do teach us really useful skills.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:20:58):**  And at the same time, I strongly believe that it's just hardwired into our DNA.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:03):**  We've like lived from and off and with this, this earth for a really long time.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:10):**  So it's just, it's just kind of in us.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:13):**  And I do think we can get confused and, or not be able to, or we don't feel confident.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:22):**  Like we feel like, oh, we don't really know these things, I have to go to school to learn  
**[0:21:25-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:25):**  it.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:25):**  But I really believe that it's there.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:29):**  And it's just, if we get out of our own way and that it's there for us to kind of use  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:35):**  as our guiding voice and our design principles.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:39):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:40):**  I really liked the way you spelled that out because it gives a lot of sort of empowerment  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:46):**  and inspiration to people who maybe don't have a formal education in this, that perhaps  
**[0:21:51-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:51):**  their intuition and their own feelings could guide them well enough to create these, these  
**[0:21:57-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:57):**  spaces for themselves and for their community.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:00):**  How about you, Mark?  
**[0:22:01-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:01):**  Where do you draw your inspiration?  
**[0:22:04-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:04):**  Well, let's see.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:07):**  I think I would start by just agreeing with what you just said.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:13):**  A lot of the choices that I make are, well, choices that I make are ultimately all confirmed  
**[0:22:20-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:20):**  by how I feel.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:22):**  There's so many choices that you can make with respect to design.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:27):**  Even like one of my favorite roles to play these days is to support the design initiative  
**[0:22:34-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:34):**  of others.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:34):**  Because frankly, when I'm designing, I can already visualize what it is I'm trying to  
**[0:22:39-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:39):**  create, which means the rest of the time I'm kind of producing it, which is kind of fun.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:44):**  But it's nothing compared to supporting and assisting other people.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:50):**  In their process of kind of arriving at their creative capacity, their ability to express  
**[0:22:57-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:57):**  themselves.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:58):**  So I get to witness that unfolding or flowering, you might say.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:23:06):**  And it's got scales of satisfaction.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:23:10):**  You get to watch people having this experience as individuals.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:23:14):**  You get to watch mothers working with their children, facilitating their involvement.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:23:20):**  And then you get to see all of these people working as a group, discovering their deeper  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:23:27):**  identity with each other, their broader, larger identity.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:23:31):**  And it brings me sometimes to my knees with joy and joy in the way that I'm trying to  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:23:44):**  just an overwhelming emotion.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:23:48):**  And it's hard to even describe quite how I feel about it, because what I'm tapping into  
**[0:23:58-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:23:58):**  in myself is not just my personal experience, but in order to help start City Repair, I  
**[0:24:09-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:24:09):**  had to go around and travel for many years, basically going around to different indigenous  
**[0:24:18-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:24:18):**  conditions, different places.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:24:20):**  Basically, I was asking what is wrong with me and what is wrong with my society.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:24:27):**  And whether I was visiting Mayan people or Egyptians during Ramadan, everybody was so  
**[0:24:33-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:24:33):**  startled and moved and sort of overjoyed even to be asked by a white man for their perspective  
**[0:24:42-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:24:42):**  on Western culture, the United States in particular.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:24:46):**  So your question about where does my inspiration come from, it very largely comes from not  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:24:53):**  just the fact that I got all these multiple perspectives and literally sets of advice  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:24:58):**  over and over again about how to understand colonialism and the intellectual  
**[0:25:03-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:03):**  and the intentional disruption of culture, which characterizes the history of our country  
**[0:25:10-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:10):**  and about which we are so much in denial.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:15):**  But it's only part of that.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:16):**  I mean, what really propels me is the brotherhood and sisterhood that was offered to me as I  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:22):**  went around seeking to be accountable for my kind, for my people.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:26):**  And people were so receptive and happy to share their perspective.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:32):**  And for that, I got a lot of growthful fertilizer for my soul.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:40):**  So when I'm watching us, when I'm helping to, I guess, apply that advice, like say I'm  
**[0:25:48-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:48):**  in a neighborhood and I walk into the circumstance already knowing that everyone's isolated  
**[0:25:53-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:53):**  and they don't know it.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:54):**  It's so normative.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:55):**  They don't even know it.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:57):**  And then yet again, I get to be part of helping people sit down and just begin to speak to  
**[0:26:01-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:01):**  each other.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:02):**  And I'm sitting there knowing that they can, that it's within their capacity within a few  
**[0:26:07-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:07):**  minutes to reactivate all these faculties that they have used for thousands of years  
**[0:26:12-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:12):**  in their ancestry to actually speak and listen to each other and then fuse together their  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:19):**  metaphors and their references and their memories into an expression of their kind of cumulative  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:24):**  or their collaborative self.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:28):**  And it works every time.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:30):**  Even, and you can witness so many different ways that it happens.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:34):**  Like if there's a disruptive person there intending to stop them, you know that they  
**[0:26:41-0:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:41):**  are just being a villager trying to defend their sense of place.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:44):**  And if you continue to feed that, the goodness of that, the nimbi can become a powerful  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:50):**  supporter and ally rather than just trying to fight against them and stop them.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:56):**  If you understand them more deeply, then you can help them to awaken to what they're really  
**[0:27:02-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:02):**  trying to do, which is that they really care about the village.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:06):**  They don't just want to defend the only thing that, the only ways that they know, the only  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:10):**  patterns that they know, but they, that they care about it deeply enough to actually start  
**[0:27:14-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:14):**  becoming creative.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:15):**  So when I see this playing out, and then I remember the moments of the empathy and compassion  
**[0:27:22-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:22):**  that were extended to me.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:25):**  It, it makes me think of those people that I was visiting and just remember their love  
**[0:27:33-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:33):**  and their kindness.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:34):**  And that's an inspiration for me that has really opened up, I guess metaphorically speaking,  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:40):**  I feel like I was an artist before I thought I was a real badass.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:44):**  I could draw like a maniac, but I was nothing compared to who I am now that I have started  
**[0:27:51-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:51):**  to find satisfaction so much more satisfaction in helping support the emergence of other  
**[0:27:58-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:58):**  people.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:59):**  It's opened up my creative capacity in ways that were unimaginable to me before.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:06):**  And I could do so much more individually, but now I'm capable of things I never could  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:12):**  have imagined before it became like this.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:15):**  So I guess one thing that is also very propelling in this just kind of like perpetual motion  
**[0:28:22-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:22):**  is the personal transformation effects of doing this kind of work are restorative.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:28):**  They grow your capacity as a leader.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:32):**  They help you to be sincerely humble.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:34):**  They calm your heart issues that you might have been carrying for years and years disperse.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:40):**  And they disperse because you're finally more in alignment with your own nature.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:45):**  Of course, you're going to be phobic if you're running around thinking you're alone in the  
**[0:28:49-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:49):**  world.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:50):**  And of course, you're going to start to become a healthier person as you're interacting  
**[0:28:54-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:54):**  with increasingly healthy people all around you.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:57):**  So it's a very restorative process that is self renewing, I would say.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:01):**  And it's also very possible for you to exhaust yourself and burn yourself out at the same  
**[0:29:05-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:05):**  time.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:07):**  So it's complicated.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:08):**  But the inspiration can come from anyone, anywhere, anytime, I would say.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:13):**  Certainly, that's a very valuable perspective.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:16):**  And that also echoes a lot of my own experiences as I've been traveling internationally and  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:21):**  actually where I'm living right now here in rural Guatemala in a small indigenous town  
**[0:29:26-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:26):**  in the highlands.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:27):**  My God, where are you?  
**[0:29:29-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:29):**  I am in Sununan, Lake Atitlan.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:32):**  Oh my gosh.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:33):**  Yeah, that's one of the places I've been.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:37):**  That's one of the places where I was for a while.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:40):**  Yeah, a lot of people have passed through here.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:41):**  It's been a congregation point for a lot of good ideas and well, actually, a lot of war  
**[0:29:47-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:47):**  in the past, too.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:48):**  So there's a lot of energy and a lot of history to this place.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:52):**  But yeah, I'm very fortunate to be in a small town that has been largely untouched through  
**[0:29:57-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:57):**  a lot of these events over history.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:59):**  In fact, the main language spoken in the town is Cachical and Spanish is a second language  
**[0:30:05-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:05):**  to pretty much everyone here.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:06):**  It makes for some very interesting communication dynamics.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:10):**  Gosh, I'm wonderful that you're there.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:13):**  It's making my head swirl.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:15):**  We'll have to talk more after this interview and catch up on your experiences here.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:19):**  But hey, so up until now, we've talked a lot about the theories and the concepts behind  
**[0:30:24-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:24):**  placemaking and your work.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:27):**  Could you talk a little bit about some of the projects that you've helped to facilitate  
**[0:30:31-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:31):**  over the years and some which have had unique impacts on their communities through City  
**[0:30:36-0:30:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:36):**  Repair, starting with Reedy?  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:39):**  I guess I can begin with the places that I inhabit, because that's personal.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:45):**  But maybe I'll start off broad and say, yeah, so there are times when I would say people  
**[0:30:55-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:55):**  have had sad experiences from doing projects or like, you know, burning out or whatever.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:31:02):**  I don't want to paint this picture that's like, it's all good, right?  
**[0:31:05-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:31:05):**  It's complex and we're working our ways through it.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:31:08):**  So yeah, I just want to present that.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:31:12):**  And then I've often, so often heard of these incredible stories of just people unfolding  
**[0:31:22-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:31:22):**  and realizing that they have the power to influence, you know, their neighborhood, their  
**[0:31:29-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:31:29):**  neighbors, themselves.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:31:31):**  Like, and it's kind of part of why our work is really hard to measure and evaluate is  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:31:38):**  because it's kind of like how Mark described the birthing of City Repair.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:31:43):**  You know, it's timeless.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:31:46):**  And you can try to like highlight certain threads, but you're never going to have all  
**[0:31:51-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:31:51):**  of it.  
**[0:31:53-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:31:53):**  And so sometimes I've seen how communities come forward, they do a street painting and  
**[0:32:00-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:32:00):**  then they realize they all share a passion for community resilience and emergency preparedness.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:32:07):**  This is a story from Eugene that I heard.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:32:11):**  Sometimes it's like, you know, people come together and then they realize, oh, there's  
**[0:32:16-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:32:16):**  this elderly neighbor that we have who doesn't want to ask for help, but could really use  
**[0:32:24-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:32:24):**  some help from us younger people taking out Blackberry.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:32:29):**  And it's and again, it's like it's not just that the the act of painting the street or  
**[0:32:35-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:32:35):**  a village building convergence project itself is solely responsible, but it does catalyze  
**[0:32:42-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:32:42):**  a cascading series of like this enmeshing of our relationships.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:32:48):**  Right.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:32:48):**  And so, you know, it might even be as simple as in my old homestead, you know, we'd be  
**[0:32:53-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:32:53):**  out in the garden doing a work party, like orienting volunteers, and then we're just  
**[0:32:59-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:32:59):**  out and about in on edges that that we can interact with our neighbors and then they  
**[0:33:05-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:05):**  call out to us and we invite them in and then they ask us what we're doing.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:09):**  And then we're like, well, we're doing this thing.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:11):**  And then they're like, wow, that sounds cool.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:13):**  And then so it begins, you know, and it just like reinforces this impulse to be a healing  
**[0:33:20-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:20):**  force with the land, collaborating with the land and with each other.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:25):**  And so, you know, we we painted the street outside my house where I currently live on  
**[0:33:30-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:30):**  Sunday, just this last Sunday.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:32):**  And I was reminded how I know my neighbors, but I've been I can easily slip into this.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:39):**  I'm busy.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:40):**  I have all this stuff to do and go to work in, you know, the same things that we that  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:46):**  I feel like I'm I'm trying to fight against sometimes as well.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:51):**  And I was like, oh, you know what?  
**[0:33:52-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:52):**  I'm going to text my neighbor that I that I just saw who brought her kid out to paint  
**[0:33:57-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:57):**  the street and ask her whether she likes goat milk.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:00):**  I've lived next to her for a whole year and I don't know this because I just wanted to  
**[0:34:05-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:05):**  gift her something, you know, and it just it's I feel like this work reminds us of who  
**[0:34:12-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:12):**  we are and what's important to us.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:15):**  And then it creates a mechanism or a container for us to find that deeper connection and  
**[0:34:23-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:23):**  then activate around it.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:25):**  Even if it might be as simple as like mutual support emotionally, but it could also be  
**[0:34:29-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:29):**  like, you know, some really significant activist oriented things like like neighborhood scale  
**[0:34:36-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:36):**  or block scale, solar energy or renewable energy and earthquake preparedness.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:43):**  Who knows?  
**[0:34:44-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:44):**  Right, like it I just feel like it gives it gives us that opportunity or makes that potential  
**[0:34:52-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:52):**  palpable.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:53):**  So you feel like, oh, you know what?  
**[0:34:55-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:55):**  This is possible.  
**[0:34:57-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:57):**  So, yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:59):**  Yeah, it's really once you get started with a project, it takes on a life of its own and  
**[0:35:04-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:35:04):**  it seems like it facilitates connections that grow larger than the initial project or investment  
**[0:35:12-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:35:12):**  and can manifest as different things as they grow, mature or make connections in other  
**[0:35:19-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:35:19):**  ways as well.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:35:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:35:23):**  How about you, Mark?  
**[0:35:24-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:35:24):**  What are some of the projects that you've done recently or in the past and how they've  
**[0:35:28-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:35:28):**  impacted the communities in which you've done them?  
**[0:35:31-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:35:31):**  Well, I'm thinking right now of the most recent, like literally the last meeting and then the  
**[0:35:41-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:35:41):**  first one, and I'm also thinking about your question from earlier about sources of inspiration.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:35:49):**  So I want to talk about this.  
**[0:35:55-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:35:55):**  We've basically been helping to be part of the the movement to create tiny home based  
**[0:36:04-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:36:04):**  villages by and for homeless people since 1999.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:36:07):**  So we're really, we are both the old kind of the oldest design activist entity in the  
**[0:36:13-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:36:13):**  country, in a sense, or the most senior involved in this from the start.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:36:20):**  We've always been involved and we've been involved in pushing and pushing and pushing  
**[0:36:26-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:36:26):**  the idea that, well, the awareness that people can be healed.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:36:34):**  They can come together.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:36:35):**  They can find new purpose.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:36:37):**  They can have a restorative effect that so-called broken people, people that are cast away by  
**[0:36:43-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:36:43):**  our society can find a place and new value in the village.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:36:50):**  And there's so much more to it, though.  
**[0:36:53-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:36:53):**  I mean, for me personally, it's it's maybe the leverage point for reintroducing human  
**[0:37:01-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:37:01):**  scale, car free, utterly participatory environment of self regulation that integrates living  
**[0:37:10-0:37:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:37:10):**  and working again, which to me is the antidote to people keep asking, like, is this the answer?  
**[0:37:15-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:37:15):**  Is this the answer to everything?  
**[0:37:17-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:37:17):**  In fact, really, I think the Tribune this week, its front page article is focused on  
**[0:37:23-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:37:23):**  our villages and it's asking, is this the answer?  
**[0:37:27-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:37:27):**  Yeah, it's that this is the ultimate form of place making where it's not just the  
**[0:37:31-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:37:31):**  bench, it's the whole damn landscape.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:37:34):**  It's absolutely everything that can be considered from the social organism and how  
**[0:37:38-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:37:38):**  itself regulates through grassroots democracy and how it propels itself through all forms  
**[0:37:44-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:37:44):**  of alternative currency.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:37:47):**  Not even necessarily needing money anymore to the most the most permacultural expression  
**[0:37:56-0:38:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:37:56):**  of everything being in relative location and all these functions, dysfunctions actually  
**[0:38:01-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:01):**  being stacked to the point where you're actually producing functions out of dysfunction.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:07):**  Yeah, and so it's really ground us in the awareness that it's the village that's  
**[0:38:12-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:12):**  been missing the whole time.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:13):**  It's why we even have homelessness at all.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:16):**  It's why we have crazy rich people thinking that they need more than they can possibly  
**[0:38:19-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:19):**  ever spend.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:21):**  It's because of this dystopic condition that we're in.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:24):**  So that's our newest project.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:25):**  Oh, our newest, our newest, that's actually a continuity that goes almost back to the  
**[0:38:31-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:31):**  beginning as a project type.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:33):**  But the most recent one is a home for a village for veterans, United States veterans in a  
**[0:38:40-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:40):**  small town outside of Portland, where the small conservative town, actually the county,  
**[0:38:46-0:38:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:46):**  this very conservative county is doing this work on behalf of the veterans within its  
**[0:38:52-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:52):**  boundaries.  
**[0:38:53-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:53):**  And there's supposed to be this antagonism between progressive Portland and rural Clackamas  
**[0:39:00-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:00):**  County, but a bridge has been established at the most radical edges for Portland now  
**[0:39:07-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:07):**  to inform how Clackamas County starts to actively take care of their veterans.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:13):**  So we're actually designing a village with all these powerful, outstanding, professional  
**[0:39:19-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:19):**  corporate collaborators that are being transformed through their participation in this project.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:25):**  So that's an incredible thing.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:28):**  And why I'm able to make such wild claims is because we're creating a place where the  
**[0:39:33-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:33):**  veterans will actually, I mean, as opposed to in their harsh military conditioning programs,  
**[0:39:38-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:38):**  that in so many ways resulted in them being betrayed and broken.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:44):**  This will be a place where they live in a more geomorphic way.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:47):**  It'll be a landscape that's not, it's not, it won't be like anything that they've known  
**[0:39:51-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:51):**  before, you know, where basically they're just slotted in next to other people's homes,  
**[0:39:56-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:56):**  as if everyone is just a product and a worker.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:59):**  There's going to be a dignity to this landscape, where the buildings are addressing the sun  
**[0:40:04-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:40:04):**  and capturing, you know, passive sunlight and turning it into heat and light inside  
**[0:40:10-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:40:10):**  of their spaces and then they'll have common spaces, not just for them to enjoy but where  
**[0:40:15-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:40:15):**  they'll have meaningful roles to actually run the village.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:40:18):**  Everything from making decisions together about every large and small detail to how  
**[0:40:25-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:40:25):**  they will take out the garbage and maintain the landscape.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:40:28):**  So it'll be their place as they transition back into a life that is, you know, more dignified  
**[0:40:36-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:40:36):**  for them off of the streets, back to their families or off of the streets and on with  
**[0:40:42-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:40:42):**  their destiny. So that's a current project.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:40:46):**  The very first project though, was, I'm thinking of it right now because of the fact  
**[0:40:51-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:40:51):**  that you're there down next to the lake, Atatlan.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:40:57):**  We really got started. The final piece of advice that I was going around gathering came  
**[0:41:04-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:41:04):**  from the Lacandon Maya north of you in Chiapas, and the launch pad for me from there was  
**[0:41:10-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:41:10):**  being in San Pedro for several months and learning and growing, adventuring in the  
**[0:41:17-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:41:17):**  landscape and visiting various cooperativas. I'd been in Quetzaltenango for a pretty  
**[0:41:22-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:41:22):**  good amount of time before I arrived there. But then when I got started too.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:41:28):**  Oh really? Yep.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:41:29):**  Were you doing some language studies there or what?  
**[0:41:31-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:41:31):**  Yep, just like everybody. Great. Well, that's, that's the best town.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:41:36):**  It is the best. Great community there. So, yeah, I ended up with the Lacandon Maya  
**[0:41:44-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:41:44):**  and I'd been intending to go there for a long time because they're famous for having  
**[0:41:48-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:41:48):**  never been conquered and distorted by having, you know, being forcibly Catholicism or,  
**[0:41:56-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:41:56):**  you know, forced to live in, in, in colonial grid patterns.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:42:01):**  So, in nonetheless, they've, they've still been impacted since they were recontacted  
**[0:42:06-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:42:06):**  about, I don't know, 95 years ago or something, 85 years ago, maybe.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:42:11):**  So, I guess I'm thinking about you asked earlier about source of inspiration this,  
**[0:42:16-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:42:16):**  this project was informed by an education in urban design and a bit of some mystical  
**[0:42:24-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:42:24):**  amazingness related to the Lacandon. And then I would say a bit of kind of Jedi  
**[0:42:31-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:42:31):**  stuff too, which is, which is a bit magical about trusting your feelings and following  
**[0:42:36-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:42:36):**  your heart. But basically, I mean, the mystical part is when I was there with the Lacandon  
**[0:42:43-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:42:43):**  asking what was wrong with me. They described the destruction of my own villages and,  
**[0:42:48-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:42:48):**  you know, the, the idea that my family had basically been conscripted forcibly to become  
**[0:42:52-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:42:52):**  part of this colonizing force and to try to figure out what you can do to stop that was  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:43:00):**  almost a fruitless exercise without finding your own roots and understanding what had  
**[0:43:05-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:43:05):**  happened to your own people so they advised me to learn the story of when my own ancestors  
**[0:43:12-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:43:12):**  first came into contact with these aggressive regimented structures that are so violently  
**[0:43:18-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:43:18):**  imposed. And that was very helpful once I got home, but they keep talking about, they  
**[0:43:22-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:43:22):**  kept talking about the lines drawn on the landscape, the absence of gathering places  
**[0:43:27-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:43:27):**  in the absence of, you know, cultural dynamism within the landscapes where we live, and you  
**[0:43:33-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:43:33):**  know all this stuff. And when I got home. It was overwhelming. I was deep in contact  
**[0:43:40-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:43:40):**  shock and actually seriously contemplating killing myself. But fortunately, and this  
**[0:43:46-0:43:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:43:46):**  is one of the mystical aspects fortunately they told me exactly what to do when I had  
**[0:43:51-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:43:51):**  come to a moment where I was, I was, I was, I felt, I felt hopeless. So they just said,  
**[0:43:58-0:44:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:43:58):**  Okay, once you feel that then remember this and think about this. And so right right when  
**[0:44:04-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:44:04):**  I was in deepest despair and feeling absolutely empty. Suddenly I remembered what the advice  
**[0:44:11-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:44:11):**  that I had been given in that moment. And I was filled, I stood up and I looked outside  
**[0:44:16-0:44:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:44:16):**  the window of this garage that I was living in I was unable to even support myself I was  
**[0:44:21-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:44:21):**  so upset about coming back to a society of such confusion and violence. But I looked  
**[0:44:28-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:44:28):**  outside the window and I suddenly visualize this thing that would become the first project  
**[0:44:34-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:44:34):**  that was this catalyst. And basically, you know, the most essential pieces of the human  
**[0:44:41-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:44:41):**  landscape they're missing in American communities are things like the public square. And then  
**[0:44:45-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:44:45):**  the great meeting house the non dogmatic, you know, non non non theological gathering  
**[0:44:53-0:44:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:44:53):**  place, more open ended, multicultural, I mean, multi multi use intergenerational space that  
**[0:44:59-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:44:59):**  is as much spiritual as it is just simply functional, a great gathering place. And so  
**[0:45:05-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:45:05):**  I just saw it in front of my eyes. And that was the thing that I just then said about  
**[0:45:12-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:45:12):**  creating that very night and work for months and months until it was done. But the crazy  
**[0:45:18-0:45:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:45:18):**  thing is that it was literally described before it was ever met. I mean, before I even visualized  
**[0:45:24-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:45:24):**  it in Portland, it was actually described in the rainforest in Chiapas. And I remember  
**[0:45:30-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:45:30):**  listening to them talk about this space and I was like, how in the world will that be  
**[0:45:35-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:45:35):**  possible? How in the world will will that be created, and actually debating it. And  
**[0:45:42-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:45:42):**  they said, basically, just learn who you are. Stand in the middle of a street intersection  
**[0:45:49-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:45:49):**  and look at the long straight, straight flat lines, know your own story. And then just  
**[0:45:56-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:45:56):**  begin to create and become as healthy as possible, because everyone around you will is deeply  
**[0:46:04-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:46:04):**  interested in becoming healthy again. And so create a space for them to come together.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:46:09):**  So this thing was designed to be like a giant womb that everyone could re-enter together  
**[0:46:16-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:46:16):**  and then have an experience of, in a sense, rebirthing. But without anyone, without any  
**[0:46:21-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:46:21):**  program, without any sort of coercion, nobody saying what needed to be done, no chanting,  
**[0:46:27-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:46:27):**  no mantras, just basically an open-ended potluck in a fabulous space that reintegrated people  
**[0:46:33-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:46:33):**  with nature. And then everything in City Repair basically, you know, kind of then accelerated  
**[0:46:42-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:46:42):**  from there, I would say. Fantastic. Yeah, that's quite a beautiful vision. Moving on  
**[0:46:48-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:46:48):**  to some of your other projects, Riddhi, could you tell me about some of the mobile installations  
**[0:46:53-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:46:53):**  that you've helped to build and where did the inspiration from those come from? Well,  
**[0:46:59-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:46:59):**  the most recent one that we've been working on is the Tea Crab. And, gosh, again, it's  
**[0:47:11-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:47:11):**  really hard to pinpoint, but I'll do my best, Oliver. I think what was, what we were, what  
**[0:47:19-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:47:19):**  happened was that we were thinking about a bike version that wasn't fossil fuel, as fossil  
**[0:47:25-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:47:25):**  fuel based as regular vehicles. And so then we, as we were having conversations, one of  
**[0:47:35-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:47:35):**  my housemates is a gifted artist. And, you know, I, here's a little side note, it gives  
**[0:47:45-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:47:45):**  me great pleasure to connect artists to collaborate together. Like collaborative art is just so  
**[0:47:53-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:47:53):**  utterly beautiful to me. And also it gives me so much joy to connect good men. So that  
**[0:48:00-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:48:00):**  because I feel like, you know, patriarchy, and paternalism doesn't just affect women  
**[0:48:07-0:48:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:48:07):**  or, you know, the feminine aspect, but it really hurts the masculine as well. And so  
**[0:48:13-0:48:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:48:13):**  I feel like women tend to gather more easily than men do. So anyway, I was like, I need  
**[0:48:19-0:48:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:48:19):**  to make these people meet and hang out. And so that was part of my evil plan. But anyway,  
**[0:48:26-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:48:26):**  back to the actual, to the Tea Crab. And then I think that part of the inspiration also  
**[0:48:34-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:48:34):**  was we were doing some houseless support during the cold snap that we had this past winter.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:48:41):**  And we, you know, so we're looking at people and how they survive with like eight inches  
**[0:48:47-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:48:47):**  of snow on the ground. And like, you know, just, we had to trump through some, some difficult  
**[0:48:56-0:49:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:48:56):**  terrain, even though it was in the city. And so the inspiration for it being a crab and  
**[0:49:01-0:49:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:49:01):**  how it carries its own home on its back, and just like kind of querying and questioning  
**[0:49:08-0:49:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:49:08):**  this concept of, do we call, do we need to call a box, a house? Or like, how do, why  
**[0:49:17-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:49:17):**  do we identify people who don't kind of, you know, conform to our notion of a house? Like,  
**[0:49:25-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:49:25):**  why is there so much stigma? And there's just a lot of deep conversations around that,  
**[0:49:30-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:49:30):**  that I feel like also fueled the Tea Crab in some ways. And then, of course, it's, you know,  
**[0:49:36-0:49:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:49:36):**  like Mark was saying a bit of magic where you're like, okay, and then it also has to be this  
**[0:49:42-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:49:42):**  super inspiring and kind of mystical creature that attracts people. It kind of ruptures the  
**[0:49:51-0:50:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:49:51):**  mundane by giving people this out of ordinary experience in like any kind of underutilized  
**[0:50:02-0:50:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:50:02):**  space or a park or wherever it is that we choose to take it. And so the idea being with this,  
**[0:50:08-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:50:08):**  with this version that we want to get it into most spaces that like are different spaces,  
**[0:50:17-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:50:17):**  perhaps, I don't know, we're still trying to figure out what the programming will look like.  
**[0:50:22-0:50:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:50:22):**  But the intention definitely is to delight the inner child in us adults, as well as like actual  
**[0:50:31-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:50:31):**  children who will act on that delight more easily, perhaps. Yeah. Yeah, and I'm going to leave.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:50:41):**  That's wonderful. Now, Mark, I remember from the few times that I lived in Portland, Oregon, that  
**[0:50:47-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:50:47):**  the Village Building Convergence is quite the annual event. Could you tell my listeners about  
**[0:50:52-0:50:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:50:52):**  what the VBC is and how it got started and how it's morphed into the community, natural building  
**[0:50:58-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:50:58):**  and permaculture extravaganza that it is today? Well, I would say we continue to learn about what  
**[0:51:06-0:51:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:51:06):**  it is that we're doing. I've got an answer for you, but it keeps getting sort of better. Yeah,  
**[0:51:16-0:51:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:51:16):**  let's see. So I would say, simply put, that it is the return of the barn raising.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:51:22):**  And through it, we have through this 17 years now we've been doing this, we have learned that,  
**[0:51:31-0:51:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:51:31):**  you know, it's not just the public square that's missing. It's not just the social organism that  
**[0:51:37-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:51:37):**  regulates and maintains and programs and inhabits that public square because the square or the,  
**[0:51:45-0:51:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:51:45):**  you know, the village heart, it doesn't exist itself. It exists because of and along with,  
**[0:51:52-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:51:52):**  and, you know, sustained by the social organism that it's for. But that's, it's an expression  
**[0:52:00-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:52:00):**  of. So we've always known that from the beginning of our work. But as we've been figuring out ways  
**[0:52:09-0:52:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:52:09):**  to restore that to, you know, not just Portland, but all these other cities that are now doing  
**[0:52:14-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:52:14):**  the village building convergence along with us. We've been learning more about what we couldn't  
**[0:52:20-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:52:20):**  see before. Like, you know, you don't just have a public square, that square is there to accommodate  
**[0:52:27-0:52:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:52:27):**  all sorts of things that are supposed to be cyclical, annual events. Like imagine you're  
**[0:52:33-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:52:33):**  a village where you are meeting your own needs bioregionally. You're undoubtedly going to be  
**[0:52:38-0:52:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:52:38):**  getting together for all kinds of ways of sharing the abundance and inspiring each other and meeting  
**[0:52:45-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:52:45):**  challenges or crises, but also having sacred experiences together in that space. So one of  
**[0:52:52-0:52:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:52:52):**  the greatest ways that we organized, you know, over millennia that human beings have organized  
**[0:52:56-0:53:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:52:56):**  the ongoing development of their culture has been to come together in celebration and to do work  
**[0:53:05-0:53:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:53:05):**  and to do work projects. And the barn raising is one of the ones that we still remember,  
**[0:53:12-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:53:12):**  that used to bring communities together at a certain consistent time of year,  
**[0:53:16-0:53:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:53:16):**  in which everyone in the community had a role and played a part. It was a time of cultural fusion,  
**[0:53:23-0:53:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:53:23):**  not just to build together over a span of time, but then to celebrate and share food. And at the  
**[0:53:29-0:53:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:53:29):**  end of it, of course, the great project becomes evident. It's not about the barn at all. The barn  
**[0:53:35-0:53:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:53:35):**  is just a means to bring people together. So they see each other again, and they fall more deeply in  
**[0:53:40-0:53:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:53:40):**  love, you know, so that in the warm months that follow the barn raising, more loving happens,  
**[0:53:45-0:53:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:53:45):**  and literally children are created and families are more deeply interwoven. So it's a rediscovery.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:53:51):**  I mean, barn raisings become kind of a metaphor for people without realizing at the same time that  
**[0:53:57-0:54:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:53:57):**  it is actually desperately missing in nearly every American community. There isn't a regular way that  
**[0:54:03-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:54:03):**  people come together. You know, thinking about the fact that Americans move every four to seven  
**[0:54:09-0:54:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:54:09):**  years because there's, the roots don't go down. They uproot themselves and they look for a better  
**[0:54:15-0:54:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:54:15):**  place or they're upwardly mobile only in economic terms. But I can tell you already that the  
**[0:54:20-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:54:20):**  restoration of the barn raising, if it happens in almost any community, people suddenly realize,  
**[0:54:26-0:54:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:54:26):**  oh my god, I'm surrounded by the muscle and the talent that powers the whole society. I'm  
**[0:54:31-0:54:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:54:31):**  surrounded by all the friends that I could ever need, that I could ever want, and they stop moving.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:54:37):**  This is an amazing revelation for us to hold together. Like, oh my god, we keep searching  
**[0:54:44-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:54:44):**  for that which is already all around us, but we're so isolated and we're so used to thinking  
**[0:54:49-0:54:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:54:49):**  that we don't have power, that we don't reach out to the people around us, to even help each other  
**[0:54:54-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:54:54):**  feel more safe. I mean, how reduced have we become to the extent that we don't take an interest in  
**[0:55:01-0:55:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:55:01):**  each other's children and say to ourselves, by god, today the streets will become safer, if only  
**[0:55:07-0:55:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:55:07):**  for the children of everyone around me. You know, that used to be what got us up in the morning,  
**[0:55:13-0:55:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:55:13):**  more than anything else, more than just meeting our own basic needs. So, gosh, I've even forgotten  
**[0:55:22-0:55:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:55:22):**  the question that you asked me. We were just talking about the VBC. Yeah, so the VBC is that,  
**[0:55:28-0:55:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:55:28):**  but it's so much more than that. I mean, you know, the barn raising is just abstract until you're in  
**[0:55:37-0:55:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:55:37):**  it, and then you see that it's a way of actually bringing together, like, all of the inspiration  
**[0:55:45-0:55:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:55:45):**  and the inherent diversity of people, so that you see that everyone actually is complementary and  
**[0:55:51-0:55:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:55:51):**  bring something very special. You know, just to cut to the current time, the VBC is a way of  
**[0:55:59-0:56:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:55:59):**  standing in utter contrast to the xenophobia that's been rising, that only can exist without  
**[0:56:07-0:56:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:56:07):**  the barn raising existing. Because, you know, it's easy to polarize and divide people if they don't  
**[0:56:13-0:56:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:56:13):**  have a basis to bring them together, if they don't realize that they literally stand on common ground.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:56:17):**  It's been so easy to manipulate and polarize people simply based on insolvable political  
**[0:56:23-0:56:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:56:23):**  issues, like abortion, for instance, if people don't have a way of understanding that there's  
**[0:56:29-0:56:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:56:29):**  so much more that they share across that political divide. In fact, I can assure you that I think  
**[0:56:36-0:56:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:56:36):**  I have never, in all of the hundreds of projects that we've done in Portland, I have never even  
**[0:56:42-0:56:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:56:42):**  heard communities digress into these polarizing issues that are just played out endlessly in the  
**[0:56:50-0:56:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:56:50):**  media. They find so much more, and I can speak right now, especially about my own community  
**[0:56:55-0:57:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:56:55):**  that's been doing this for 21 years now, I don't even remember a community gathering where people  
**[0:57:01-0:57:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:57:01):**  had an argument about how they had differences politically. It's so much more about just  
**[0:57:07-0:57:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:57:07):**  excavating the wealth of all of this commonality, sharing the stories of where they live or where  
**[0:57:14-0:57:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:57:14):**  they've lived, how they feel about their place now, the new friends that they have, the ideas  
**[0:57:20-0:57:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:57:20):**  that they want to try out, the help that they need or the help that they would offer. I mean,  
**[0:57:25-0:57:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:57:25):**  literally it's endless, all the stuff that gets unleashed by doing this stuff that reveals, you  
**[0:57:30-0:57:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:57:30):**  know, physical and metaphorical common ground. So yeah, the Village Building Convergence is a  
**[0:57:37-0:57:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:57:37):**  restorative thing, and it was designed very much coached by the Lak and Don Maya before it even  
**[0:57:44-0:57:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:57:44):**  happened as a way of trying to counteract colonialism and restore things, ways of being  
**[0:57:51-0:57:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:57:51):**  that have been submerged for such a long time. And that's why it's a phenomenon that is spreading  
**[0:57:59-0:58:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:57:59):**  and taking on endless new forms with, you know, the same kind of core set of principles.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:58:06):**  Those are some great points. Riddhi, do you have anything that you would like to add to that, or  
**[0:58:11-0:58:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:58:11):**  how would you describe the VBC to anyone who hasn't heard of it before? I would say that it's  
**[0:58:17-0:58:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:58:17):**  the largest scale empowerment and just like this regenerative, future, healthier future,  
**[0:58:27-0:58:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:58:27):**  or however you want to call it, whatever you want to call it, like, it's the largest scale I've  
**[0:58:34-0:58:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:58:34):**  witnessed of it happening, and very embedded. Like it's not a convergence where you bring people  
**[0:58:41-0:58:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:58:41):**  from all different places and then you kind of share stories like this is people and empowered  
**[0:58:47-0:58:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:58:47):**  and enacting change in their own communities. And so for me, seeing that there's like, you know,  
**[0:58:56-0:59:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:58:56):**  we have between 30 to 40 sites every year implementing their projects in Portland alone.  
**[0:59:04-0:59:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:59:04):**  So to see it at that scale, it's remarkably affirming. You know, I feel like many of us  
**[0:59:12-0:59:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:59:12):**  sometimes when we first start listening to our hearts and doing this work, and at least this was  
**[0:59:18-0:59:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:59:18):**  my experience, that you feel alone in it. You feel like you don't fit and, you know, it's almost like  
**[0:59:24-0:59:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:59:24):**  there's something wrong with me. I can't like turn it off. I can't turn off my empathy. I can't,  
**[0:59:28-0:59:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:59:28):**  you know, whatever, xyz. But I feel like in some ways, City Repair is where all these,  
**[0:59:36-0:59:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:59:36):**  all of us misfits kind of come together. We found each other. And then, and we don't,  
**[0:59:44-0:59:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:59:44):**  and we all have our different quirks. And like all of these placemakers too, you know, they're not  
**[0:59:50-0:59:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:59:50):**  accepting things just as they are. They are an impulse of like making things more wonderful.  
**[0:59:57-1:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:59:57):**  And so I feel like we found each other and we're finding ways to kind of highlight and bolster each  
**[1:00:08-1:00:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:00:08):**  other's creative and unique spirit, which is just so beautiful. Collaborative leadership to me is  
**[1:00:15-1:00:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:00:15):**  just, it's so joyful because I feel like it just is such a regenerative social and cultural pattern  
**[1:00:24-1:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:00:24):**  that we need more of. So that's how I would describe it. That's lovely. That's really well said.  
**[1:00:31-1:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:00:31):**  Now I want to shift gears here just a little bit and really make use of some of your experience  
**[1:00:35-1:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:00:35):**  and expertise here. Knowing my own Go-Getter audience of this podcast, what advice would you  
**[1:00:41-1:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:00:41):**  give to my listeners on some of the most effective actions that they could take to facilitate  
**[1:00:46-1:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:00:46):**  connection and cooperation in their own communities? If you have any specific examples,  
**[1:00:51-1:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:00:51):**  even better. Go ahead, Reedy. I would say,  
**[1:00:59-1:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:00:59):**  first off, maybe be humble. Like, I feel like part of what drew me to this work and keeps me here  
**[1:01:07-1:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:01:07):**  is just the open-endedness of it, where it's not ever complete because more people arrive. And so  
**[1:01:14-1:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:01:14):**  there's spaciousness for people to contribute in meaningful and deep ways. So to not have that  
**[1:01:21-1:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:01:21):**  attachment to things being a certain way, but a commitment to the process of helping each other  
**[1:01:28-1:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:01:28):**  unfold. And I feel like I would say for me, that has been humility over and over again. And also,  
**[1:01:38-1:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:01:38):**  just really, really trying to uphold pluralism. I've noticed that when I get triggered  
**[1:01:46-1:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:01:46):**  or when I'm overwhelmed, I find it hard to hear another perspective that's different from my own.  
**[1:01:52-1:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:01:52):**  But ideally, we would be inclusive and taking into consideration diversity of opinions and  
**[1:01:59-1:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:01:59):**  perspectives. So pluralism. And then taking away our fear of failure. So really embracing  
**[1:02:08-1:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:02:08):**  and celebrating failure because we are definitely going to fail. I guarantee you, you will fail.  
**[1:02:15-1:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:02:15):**  And that's part of it. It's a learning journey. So really looking at it as a learning journey. And  
**[1:02:23-1:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:02:23):**  then perhaps the last thing I'll say is being gentle and trusting and forgiving of oneself.  
**[1:02:31-1:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:02:31):**  I bring a lot of my own grief into this. Whether it's like my colonial effects on my ancestry,  
**[1:02:43-1:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:02:43):**  my own ancestry. I feel like humanity, we're very complex. We're both capable of amazing things and  
**[1:02:50-1:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:02:50):**  also really horrific things. And so while I feel like the BBC and City Repel, we really highlight  
**[1:02:59-1:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:02:59):**  and catalyze the positive tendencies that humanity has. I feel like holding space for our grief so  
**[1:03:09-1:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:03:09):**  that we can transmute it into this beauty is equally important. So when we do find like  
**[1:03:16-1:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:03:16):**  in ourselves things that are hard or in others, like to be compassionate and especially with  
**[1:03:23-1:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:03:23):**  ourselves as activists, I really want to emphasize that because I see an activist culture where  
**[1:03:30-1:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:03:30):**  often really hard on ourselves and then that ripples out into burnout culture and other toxic  
**[1:03:37-1:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:03:37):**  patterns. So yeah. Yeah, that's really valuable advice. I think I'm actually going to have to  
**[1:03:43-1:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:03:43):**  implement some of that myself. Mark, same question to you. Okay. Well, let's see. I will just pass on  
**[1:03:51-1:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:03:51):**  some Mayan advice, which is this. The revolution you seek needs to be one where you can start  
**[1:03:59-1:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:03:59):**  right now with whatever you have and whoever is with you. So that's it. But what does that mean?  
**[1:04:11-1:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:04:11):**  It leads to a lot of things. You challenge colonialism, which tells you that you have  
**[1:04:19-1:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:04:19):**  no power, that you can only vote or write a check to a cause or write a letter to your congressman  
**[1:04:25-1:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:04:25):**  and hope that somebody else will care enough to do something and someone else will have enough  
**[1:04:30-1:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:04:30):**  of a budget to pay someone else to act on your behalf. All of that is bullshit. It is bullshit.  
**[1:04:38-1:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:04:38):**  Although I would say do what you can. Voting is not bullshit in the sense that people  
**[1:04:44-1:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:04:44):**  have fought against this paradigm in order to ensure that people have rights and access  
**[1:04:49-1:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:04:49):**  in that realm. People died to vote. So that's not bullshit. But it's bullshit to say that that's  
**[1:04:56-1:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:04:56):**  your only spectrum for action. It's bullshit that other people define the issues for you that you  
**[1:05:04-1:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:05:04):**  vote on without necessarily asking you what you really want to vote on. That's bullshit. But  
**[1:05:11-1:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:05:11):**  giving voice in every single way that you can is important. And I think that's what I would say.  
**[1:05:17-1:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:05:17):**  Giving voice in every single way that you can is important. So writing a check to support causes  
**[1:05:25-1:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:05:25):**  and organizations, that's important. Being an advocate in any way that you can that you're given  
**[1:05:32-1:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:05:32):**  in this construct, that's all important. But it's even more important, like thinking about that  
**[1:05:38-1:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:05:38):**  advice to act where you are right now with whoever you have and whatever you have, is basically trying  
**[1:05:44-1:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:05:44):**  to the idea that we actually have our power. We stand in it right now. That it's absurd to say  
**[1:05:49-1:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:05:49):**  that anyone else can possibly have your power is a trick. It's a trick. It's a strange kind of  
**[1:05:57-1:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:05:57):**  structure that we carry around with ourselves, like a box on our head that prevents us from  
**[1:06:03-1:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:06:03):**  seeing the beauty of the world and feeling our true strength to speak. Freaking we have thumbs  
**[1:06:10-1:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:06:10):**  and ears. We have a voice, like we can sing. There's actually limitless ways that we can  
**[1:06:17-1:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:06:17):**  affect the world with the spectrum of our senses and our embodiment to actually go forth and  
**[1:06:23-1:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:06:23):**  immediately change the world. So what does that mean in practical terms? I mean, for myself,  
**[1:06:30-1:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:06:30):**  I walked into an intersection. I looked around. I'd been coached to realize that standing in an  
**[1:06:37-1:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:06:37):**  intersection in the colonial grid, you're standing where the village was supposed to begin. Because  
**[1:06:41-1:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:06:41):**  intersections are where the pathways of our lives come together. That's where we should be creating  
**[1:06:46-1:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:06:46):**  culture. We should be interacting with each other in that space. It should not be nullified and just  
**[1:06:51-1:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:06:51):**  reduced to a traffic corridor. In terms of the lineage of our thousands and thousands of years  
**[1:06:57-1:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:06:57):**  together, that was always a place where our lives converged. And in fact, in urban design and  
**[1:07:02-1:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:07:02):**  planning, the first move to design a village is to find that point where your lives come together in  
**[1:07:09-1:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:07:09):**  an intersection and enhance that through placemaking so that it actually serves its primordial  
**[1:07:14-1:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:07:14):**  function to bring people together. But first, to do that, you have to reclaim your power. You have  
**[1:07:21-1:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:07:21):**  to take the box off of your head, the leash off of your neck, the collar, and then unleash yourself,  
**[1:07:28-1:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:07:28):**  free yourself, and say to yourself, I indeed have my power. And my life purpose now will flower as I  
**[1:07:36-1:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:07:36):**  go forth seeking the liberation of everyone else around me. And like Riddhi said, you're going to  
**[1:07:43-1:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:07:43):**  have plenty of chances to make mistakes. And instead of fearing those, like instead of numbing  
**[1:07:48-1:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:07:48):**  yourself or silencing your voice for fear of failure, run toward those points of learning.  
**[1:07:55-1:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:07:55):**  Like, no, that's not even digression. It's not even a bump in the road. Every time you courageously  
**[1:08:02-1:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:08:02):**  go into the unknown and you encounter situations that are beyond your experience, you just jump  
**[1:08:09-1:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:08:09):**  into that because it's your chance to grow to a whole new level of power. So these so-called  
**[1:08:15-1:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:08:15):**  mistakes are actually learning opportunities. And once you start to see that, you can coach that in  
**[1:08:20-1:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:08:20):**  other people, like, yes, embrace that opportunity and turn it into, you know, turn it into the flip  
**[1:08:28-1:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:08:28):**  side of everything that you've experienced. Like everything you've experienced that's dystopic on  
**[1:08:34-1:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:08:34):**  the flip side of it is the grand glorious gleaming like missed opportunity that could always have  
**[1:08:41-1:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:08:41):**  happened instead. And now it's your time. It's a whole new chapter in your life to actually  
**[1:08:46-1:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:08:46):**  write that dystopic wrong. So reclaim your own power and start wherever you are. You know,  
**[1:08:54-1:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:08:54):**  literally, even if you're like, oh my God, but yeah, this is a mundane parking lot. No,  
**[1:08:59-1:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:08:59):**  the opportunity is right there in the mundane to transform it into something you might think of  
**[1:09:05-1:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:09:05):**  as being more miraculous. There's another thing though, to really help with that,  
**[1:09:10-1:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:09:10):**  make it part of your own healing process to dream on other people's behalf,  
**[1:09:15-1:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:09:15):**  to like seek their fulfillment, their emergence, their liberation through your own creative  
**[1:09:22-1:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:09:22):**  initiative. Like it's important to at some point realize our self obsession and self absorption to  
**[1:09:29-1:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:09:29):**  the extent that we accumulate so much, or that we only think about our own hide day in and day out  
**[1:09:36-1:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:09:36):**  is actually a symptom of living within the compartmentalization of colonialism. It's  
**[1:09:41-1:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:09:41):**  actually made you self-obsessed, you know, that kind of thing. So you break out of that and you  
**[1:09:47-1:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:09:47):**  become a larger, stronger self by actually caring about other people, dwelling on them. Like,  
**[1:09:53-1:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:09:53):**  what are they doing today? What are their dreams and aspirations? How can you connect to that? And  
**[1:09:57-1:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:09:57):**  of course, what you get in return is a form of friendship that is more sincere and real and  
**[1:10:02-1:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:10:02):**  grounded than you ever knew before, even with people that you thought you could never care  
**[1:10:07-1:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:10:07):**  about. And all of this grows your soul. It creates more surface area for your feeling and for your  
**[1:10:12-1:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:10:12):**  for your learning. So, you know, that's all very much about personal transformation. But, you know,  
**[1:10:19-1:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:10:19):**  I think it was like what Michael Stone was saying in one of his presentations just shortly before  
**[1:10:26-1:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:10:26):**  he died, that the more you become enlightened, I guess, the more you become also disturbed by the  
**[1:10:37-1:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:10:37):**  state of what everyone else is going through. And it compels you to become a more creative agent in  
**[1:10:44-1:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:10:44):**  everyone's life. So it just doesn't stop. And then that just keeps growing you. So, you know,  
**[1:10:51-1:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:10:51):**  so, you know, I guess I would also advise people, like, in a way, keep doing your spiritual practice,  
**[1:10:57-1:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:10:57):**  but also become more interested in a larger scale of self. I don't think you're going to find what  
**[1:11:03-1:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:11:03):**  you're looking for exclusively through yoga and meditation. You're going to find more of what  
**[1:11:08-1:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:11:08):**  you're looking for, probably through more surface area, more contact with the real lives and needs  
**[1:11:14-1:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:11:14):**  of the people around you. And then it'll embed these lessons in your daily way of living. That's  
**[1:11:21-1:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:11:21):**  what I would say. I'm very glad you said that. I agree with that profoundly. Now, I know from my  
**[1:11:28-1:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:11:28):**  own experience that the right considerations in planning make a world of difference in how a  
**[1:11:33-1:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:11:33):**  project turns out. And this is any type of project. Could you both give some advice on some essential  
**[1:11:39-1:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:11:39):**  factors or elements in community revitalization projects that people often overlook or forget?  
**[1:11:46-1:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:11:46):**  Well, certainly it would be, you know, those of us that are trained in the culture of design and  
**[1:11:54-1:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:11:54):**  development in architecture and planning or in construction and finance have been trained to be  
**[1:12:00-1:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:12:00):**  more about the actual project and not so much about the community and not so much about the  
**[1:12:06-1:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:12:06):**  people who will actually inhabit the project. So I think the most overlooked aspect is to make a  
**[1:12:14-1:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:12:14):**  stronger link between the potential occupants of the place and think of like, you know, low income  
**[1:12:22-1:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:12:22):**  housing, for instance. If you're only thinking of it as housing and not as a village, then all  
**[1:12:27-1:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:12:27):**  you're going to do is house people. I think even for selfish reasons, a developer should care like,  
**[1:12:33-1:12:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:12:33):**  gosh, don't you want to leave a legacy in the world? Aren't you tired of waking up every day,  
**[1:12:38-1:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:12:38):**  you know, having sending your kids out into the streets of a world that only gets worse every day?  
**[1:12:43-1:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:12:43):**  Like what kind of legacy are you going to leave after all this damn work that you've done with  
**[1:12:47-1:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:12:47):**  your life? Couldn't you build more? You can use the same material, same amount of material and  
**[1:12:52-1:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:12:52):**  the same cost and create more. Doesn't that matter? So I think overlooking the community,  
**[1:12:57-1:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:12:57):**  overlooking humanity is probably the biggest omission of projects. So yeah, try to root what  
**[1:13:05-1:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:13:05):**  you do in real community. And then in terms of sustainability, there's so many different ways  
**[1:13:10-1:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:13:10):**  to think about sustainability beyond financial models that also connect back to community.  
**[1:13:19-1:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:13:19):**  You know, how, because, you know, you can install like a more energy efficient heating and cooling  
**[1:13:26-1:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:13:26):**  system in your project. But if the community is just reduced to pushing buttons and not  
**[1:13:34-1:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:13:34):**  actually interacting with their environment, then you haven't really created a sustainable culture.  
**[1:13:38-1:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:13:38):**  You've only, you know, you've only created a building that's more energy efficient, but it  
**[1:13:44-1:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:13:44):**  won't even necessarily be inhabited that way if people can't relate to it. So again, it comes  
**[1:13:50-1:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:13:50):**  back to the community. Fantastic. All right. Same question to you, Riddhi. I'm going to draw on  
**[1:13:59-1:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:13:59):**  an approach that I learned from Judy Bluehorse, who's a mentor of mine. He's a local native  
**[1:14:08-1:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:14:08):**  herbalist and a sorceress is the way I want to describe her. But Judy, when she's working  
**[1:14:16-1:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:14:16):**  with land, installing native gardens, she has his way of really taking some time to observe  
**[1:14:24-1:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:14:24):**  who is there and seeing, perceiving the land, not so much from her own frame of reference,  
**[1:14:32-1:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:14:32):**  you know, oh, I want this to be like this here and what is often our own goals and expectations,  
**[1:14:42-1:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:14:42):**  color, the way that we look and perceive everything. Right. And so there might be ways  
**[1:14:47-1:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:14:47):**  that community is gathering that we haven't, we don't relate to, so we don't recognize. So  
**[1:14:53-1:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:14:53):**  I would say, you know, just taking some time when there's revitalization project, like who is there,  
**[1:14:59-1:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:14:59):**  who's revitalized, like, you know, ask questions of that, that kind of, I would say, question some  
**[1:15:07-1:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:15:07):**  presumptions that we may be starting off with. And then another thing that you just, so then, okay,  
**[1:15:15-1:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:15:15):**  so for example, then there might be lawn and dandelions and things like that. And in permaculture,  
**[1:15:21-1:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:15:21):**  we say like, okay, we first observe and then we recognize that even though the dandelions  
**[1:15:27-1:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:15:27):**  and other like, quote unquote, weeds are present, that actually they are doing beneficial things to  
**[1:15:34-1:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:15:34):**  the soil. So identifying ways that things that we may not like or want might actually be serving  
**[1:15:42-1:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:15:42):**  really core functions there and hold them together. And then when you want to change it,  
**[1:15:49-1:15:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:15:49):**  because you're like, okay, well, it's mostly dandelions. And I do want to put a native garden  
**[1:15:54-1:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:15:54):**  here. And you know, it's been gone through, like, it's the goal, not just of you, perhaps, but like,  
**[1:16:01-1:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:16:01):**  a number of you have expressed that desire, then going about it in a way that doesn't  
**[1:16:08-1:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:16:08):**  disregard or dishonor the, some of the key aspects of that place. So maybe there's ways to sheet  
**[1:16:16-1:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:16:16):**  mulch or turn the soil and plant that doesn't completely like, destroy the weeds that were  
**[1:16:24-1:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:16:24):**  present, because many of them are medicinal. Most times, I prefer to move into a project  
**[1:16:34-1:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:16:34):**  with a fair amount of time. But also, not to kind of understate that excitement of like, whoa,  
**[1:16:42-1:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:16:42):**  and then we just like blitzed this garden. And now it's got beautiful huckleberries and other  
**[1:16:49-1:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:16:49):**  gorgeous native plants. Like there is that potential for transformation, but I feel like  
**[1:16:55-1:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:16:55):**  it has to be grounded in deep listening to the inhabitants, the existing inhabitants and the  
**[1:17:02-1:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:17:02):**  future users.  
**[1:17:04-1:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:17:04):**  Absolutely. Yeah, that's a very good point. Now, just before we wrap up here, I know that there  
**[1:17:10-1:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:17:10):**  are lots of opportunities for volunteers to get involved. And there are a ton of events in  
**[1:17:15-1:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:17:15):**  especially the months ahead. Riddhi, could you give me a rundown of the ways that people can  
**[1:17:20-1:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:17:20):**  get involved with City Repair?  
**[1:17:22-1:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:17:22):**  Well, multiple ways. One I would say is if you a little bit of help in starting something similar,  
**[1:17:32-1:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:17:32):**  wherever you're at, get in touch with us. Info at cityrepair.org. We check that fairly often.  
**[1:17:40-1:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:17:40):**  And so we will respond to that as best as we can. And then if you are wanting to come visit us and  
**[1:17:49-1:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:17:49):**  embed yourself into the social culture, we're part of here. Email us either info at City Repair or  
**[1:17:57-1:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:17:57):**  volunteer at cityrepair.org. We do internships, we can do that for credit, like whatever works.  
**[1:18:05-1:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:18:05):**  We're very collaborative in the way that we co-facilitate our collective emergence. Right.  
**[1:18:12-1:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:18:12):**  So that applies to volunteer opportunities as well. We might give you some guidelines like,  
**[1:18:17-1:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:18:17):**  oh, we could use help with budget or whatever, but we're definitely looking to learn from you and to  
**[1:18:24-1:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:18:24):**  help you thrive in whatever ways you want. And then right now, seasonally, we are in budget  
**[1:18:32-1:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:18:32):**  season. That's why I mentioned it. But we're going, we still have some events because it's  
**[1:18:37-1:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:18:37):**  the summer and we're celebrating and spending time in the woods and things like that. And then  
**[1:18:44-1:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:18:44):**  in the fall, we will launch our new season for Village Building Convergence 2018. We'll be  
**[1:18:51-1:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:18:51):**  calling in proposals for community projects. So you can participate that way. We'll also be calling  
**[1:19:00-1:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:19:00):**  on folks to help us get the village up and running, which is, you know, it's a lot of  
**[1:19:07-1:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:19:07):**  interesting things like children's activities, healing, sponsorships, like all the back end,  
**[1:19:13-1:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:19:13):**  you can imagine of organizing an event of this scale. And we also have a robust organizing wing  
**[1:19:22-1:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:19:22):**  or in like connection to the houseless organizing and advocacy. So that's something we do your  
**[1:19:32-1:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:19:32):**  round. And we're very deeply immersed in like Mark mentioned earlier. So there's tons of stuff  
**[1:19:38-1:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:19:38):**  that we are implicated in currently. And we're also always open to exploring new potential  
**[1:19:46-1:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:19:46):**  horizons with what you bring in. So just get in touch. Fantastic. Thank you. And Mark, do you have  
**[1:19:54-1:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:19:54):**  anything that you'd like to add to that? Let's see. I think well, really is has been for the last,  
**[1:20:01-1:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:20:01):**  I think three years now, really the main placemaking coordinator and co executive director  
**[1:20:09-1:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:20:09):**  of city repairs. So I think she has a better sense of, of the things that are currently going on than  
**[1:20:16-1:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:20:16):**  I do, especially because my wife and I have just had a little baby girl. So I'm not quite as in  
**[1:20:24-1:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:20:24):**  touch with all that we have going on. But I would I would say that, you know, the culture of  
**[1:20:30-1:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:20:30):**  activism that we represent is very open ended. And I think that it's still true that I mean,  
**[1:20:40-1:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:20:40):**  just as really said, we're very interested in being affected by the people that come into doing.  
**[1:20:46-1:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:20:46):**  So for for people who want to come in and learn, they can easily come do that. There's people who  
**[1:20:53-1:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:20:53):**  would love to work with them. But the thing is that this is all propelled by friendship.  
**[1:20:58-1:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:20:58):**  So, you know, if if you're if you're a person that is looking to, you know, to become more  
**[1:21:05-1:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:21:05):**  skilled and experience and perhaps, you know, more equipped in some future job capacity,  
**[1:21:11-1:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:21:11):**  that's all fine. That's definitely part of what we're interested in too. But part of the terms of  
**[1:21:16-1:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:21:16):**  placemaking and also decolonization is that we elevate once again, the highest value of  
**[1:21:26-1:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:21:26):**  indigenous people of this land, which is and this is a way of reclaiming and not just on behalf of  
**[1:21:33-1:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:21:33):**  the native people of this land, but your own native self, that friendship becomes the highest  
**[1:21:37-1:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:21:37):**  value and the most sacred word. So, you know, rather than like rather than for us to say,  
**[1:21:44-1:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:21:44):**  oh, we're a nonprofit 501 C three, we have a board of directors and this is how we operate,  
**[1:21:48-1:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:21:48):**  we use consensus model or whatever it is that we that we've done. So, you know,  
**[1:21:54-1:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:21:54):**  we've also got going on. That is not none of that is more important than the fact that we are  
**[1:21:59-1:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:21:59):**  propelled and guided by the desire to to make friends and be genuine with each other.  
**[1:22:06-1:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:22:06):**  So it's very healthy culture. And when people arrive and and and want to get involved,  
**[1:22:12-1:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:22:12):**  they can surely step right in, especially to whatever's going on in the moment.  
**[1:22:17-1:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:22:17):**  But if they have an idea, a world changing idea, whether it's to address climate change or to  
**[1:22:21-1:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:22:21):**  involve, you know, youth in a more effective way. We're all about it, we want to know what people  
**[1:22:27-1:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:22:27):**  are carrying and new new projects can be birthed here. And this is an excellent foundation for  
**[1:22:34-1:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:22:34):**  people to try out things. So, you know, when we talk about city repair, we know full well,  
**[1:22:40-1:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:22:40):**  that we haven't repaired the city and we still don't quite know how to do it.  
**[1:22:44-1:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:22:44):**  It's going to take the entire city to do it. And once we're there, we'll have repaired it.  
**[1:22:48-1:22:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:22:48):**  So it's a it's a grand goal and ambition and we need everyone's help. Even our, you know,  
**[1:22:53-1:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:22:53):**  so-called adversaries eventually will realize that we're all on the same side. And that's what we mean  
**[1:22:59-1:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:22:59):**  by the repaired city. Excellent. Well, I want to thank both of you for a very insightful, very  
**[1:23:05-1:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:23:05):**  thoughtful interview. And you've been very generous with your time. I've gotten a ton of value from it.  
**[1:23:11-1:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:23:11):**  And I hope maybe we can follow up and learn a little bit about how your projects can be  
**[1:23:16-1:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:23:16):**  continued to evolve and include more and more voices in the future. We've got a great team,  
**[1:23:22-1:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:23:22):**  Oliver. It certainly sounds like it. Yeah. Well, thank you for having us. Yeah. It's been my  
**[1:23:31-1:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:23:31):**  pleasure. Thanks, Oliver. Have a great day. Thank you too, Mark. Take care, you guys. You too.  
**[1:23:39-1:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:23:39):**  So before we wrap up this show for the week, I've got some exciting news about the upcoming months.  
**[1:23:43-1:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:23:43):**  And I'm joined here now with my good friend and founder of Atitlan Organics, Shad Goodsy.  
**[1:23:48-1:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:23:48):**  Hey, buddy, what's new? Oh, man, so much is happening. First off, though, I just want to say  
**[1:23:53-1:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:23:53):**  thanks for having me, man. I really love your podcast. And I actually had a great time doing  
**[1:23:58-1:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:23:58):**  that interview back in one of the earlier episodes. Anyway, probably what's most exciting is our new  
**[1:24:04-1:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:24:04):**  collaboration between Atitlan Organics and Abundant Edge. As you know, we've been offering  
**[1:24:09-1:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:24:09):**  permaculture design courses for over six years now, and they really have become a staple here  
**[1:24:14-1:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:24:14):**  in Lake Atitlan. In particular, though, the intro to permaculture course is just an amazing way for  
**[1:24:20-1:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:24:20):**  travelers, gardeners, architects, basically anyone to fully immerse themselves in this new paradigm  
**[1:24:26-1:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:24:26):**  of permaculture design. Like honestly, you can't take this course and still see the world the same  
**[1:24:33-1:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:24:33):**  way afterward. It's life changing. But like I said, what I'm most excited about is that now,  
**[1:24:39-1:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:24:39):**  thanks to our collaboration, we're going to be able to offer your natural building course  
**[1:24:44-1:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:24:44):**  immediately after every one of our intro to permaculture courses. Literally, this two-week  
**[1:24:50-1:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:24:50):**  offering is like possibly the most complete package that I know of available anywhere.  
**[1:24:56-1:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:24:56):**  Basically, with these two courses alone, I think that someone should have everything they need to  
**[1:25:01-1:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:25:01):**  start their own regenerative project or just their own regenerative lifestyle. That's what I'm  
**[1:25:07-1:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:25:07):**  excited about, man. But yeah, what about you? What's going on? Man, well, you know already that  
**[1:25:12-1:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:25:12):**  me and the Abundant Edge team are gearing up for a big season as well. I mean, starting in November,  
**[1:25:17-1:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:25:17):**  we'll be breaking ground on a regenerative farming demonstration site, which is, of course,  
**[1:25:22-1:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:25:22):**  right down the hill from your farm. We'll be building animal pens, a classroom, outdoor  
**[1:25:27-1:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:25:27):**  kitchens, and lounge areas connected to houses, and it's all going to be made out of natural  
**[1:25:32-1:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:25:32):**  materials. I mean, the site is going to serve as a demonstration farm for perennial and regenerative  
**[1:25:37-1:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:25:37):**  farming methods for years and years to come. And we'll even be offering courses and internship  
**[1:25:42-1:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:25:42):**  opportunities to people who want to learn for themselves about how to build with natural  
**[1:25:46-1:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:25:46):**  materials and set up their own farms. Heck yeah, that sounds amazing, man. And honestly,  
**[1:25:52-1:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:25:52):**  this is just about the best place in the world to learn all these things too. I mean, this little  
**[1:25:57-1:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:25:57):**  town is Sununah in the gorgeous tropical mountains of Guatemala, like right here on the shores of  
**[1:26:02-1:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:26:02):**  Lake Atitlan. It's one of the most beautiful places in the world. And on top of that, you have  
**[1:26:06-1:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:26:06):**  this traditional indigenous Mayan culture that's still rich and alive. And probably my favorite  
**[1:26:12-1:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:26:12):**  part is that we have this world international community of alternative people that are open to  
**[1:26:18-1:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:26:18):**  new ideas and really putting things into practice. I mean, within walking distance of the bamboo  
**[1:26:23-1:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:26:23):**  guest house, you've got loads of things going on. We got the projects that we've already talked  
**[1:26:28-1:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:26:28):**  about, but you also have yoga retreat centers. You have Charlie Rendell's natural bamboo building  
**[1:26:33-1:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:26:33):**  school. You have Love Probiotics. You have Fungi Academy. And honestly, loads more alternative  
**[1:26:39-1:26:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:26:39):**  blow your mind type stuff. I honestly just feel like this is where it's all happening.  
**[1:26:44-1:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:26:44):**  Yeah, it really does. And I want to get as many people as possible in on these projects,  
**[1:26:48-1:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:26:48):**  but we've got to make sure that they've got the skills first. So what do you say? Let's offer a  
**[1:26:52-1:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:26:52):**  big discount to those who sign up for both courses. I mean, all food and lodging and the  
**[1:26:57-1:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:26:57):**  amazing bamboo guest house is already included in the tuition. So this will be like the best deal  
**[1:27:02-1:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:27:02):**  that we've ever offered. That's a great idea. Because I mean, people can still take just one  
**[1:27:07-1:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:27:07):**  course if that's what they're into, or if they can't make the full two weeks. But this will  
**[1:27:11-1:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:27:11):**  actually make the two courses more accessible to even a wider audience of people. That way more  
**[1:27:16-1:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:27:16):**  people can get the knowledge that they need to get started doing what they want to do.  
**[1:27:21-1:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:27:21):**  So hey, to all of you listening out there, we really want passionate and driven people like  
**[1:27:26-1:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:27:26):**  you to come and be a part of the community and the ecosystem that we're building out here.

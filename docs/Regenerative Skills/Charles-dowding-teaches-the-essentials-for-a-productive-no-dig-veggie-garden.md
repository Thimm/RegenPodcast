**[0:00:09-0:00:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:00:09):**  an abundant and connected future.

**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:00:20):**  book publishers that were a big inspiration to me even before I started working with ecologies  
**[0:00:25-0:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:00:25):**  and natural buildings and way before podcasting.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:00:28):**  Their titles like The Natural Plaster Book and Timber Framing for the Rest of Us really  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:00:33):**  made me believe that I could build my own home, which I eventually did.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:00:37):**  And later volumes like Ecopreneuring, Unlearn Rewild, and Building Community have offered

**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:01:08):**  I've been running with climate farmers for our Regenerative Farming Network here in Europe.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:01:13):**  This is one of the many community building activities that I've been organizing to help  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:01:16):**  to connect farmers around Europe to some of the best emerging information available and  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:01:21):**  to get their most important questions answered from our experts around the world.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:01:25):**  Now in this session I had the chance to speak with Charles Dowding in Somerset in England.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:01:30):**  Many of you already know Charles as an innovative gardener and author of nine books on caring  
**[0:01:35-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:01:35):**  for soil, as well as productive ways to grow food with less weeding through no-dig management.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:01:42):**  Now at Homemakers, his small intensive market garden, Charles teaches, runs, experiments,  
**[0:01:48-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:01:48):**  and above all produces delicious food.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:01:50):**  Based on his experience of growing vegetables without tilling for 35 years, he shows people  
**[0:01:55-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:01:55):**  from all walks of life how to grow more easily, enjoyably, and in time efficient ways.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:02:02):**  Now quickly before we get started, I want to remind all of you who would be interested  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:02:05):**  in attending one of these skill exchange calls live in the future.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:02:09):**  Now all you have to do is be a registered farmer in Europe to receive invitations and  
**[0:02:14-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:02:14):**  call links that we have coming up.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:02:16):**  And I'm planning a next session with Nigel Palmer, the author of the book The Regenerative  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:02:20):**  Grower's Guide to Garden Amendments later this month, so don't wait too long.

**[0:02:31-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:02:31):**  Charles, you have been a pioneer in no-dig market gardening for quite an experienced  
**[0:02:38-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:02:38):**  career, and people are generally interested on how they can get the ecology, especially  
**[0:02:45-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:02:45):**  in their soil, and the biodiversity that is required for a resilient growing ecosystem  
**[0:02:51-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:02:51):**  in line.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:02:53):**  What are some of the first things that you would tell to someone starting a garden for  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:02:57):**  the first time that are worth putting their efforts into, and others that they'll often  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:03:02):**  get talked about are not as an effective use of your time?  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:03:07):**  Hi Oliver, thanks for that.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:03:11):**  Quite a few.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:03:13):**  Not effective.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:03:14):**  Effective use of time is actually the main thing that I recommend anyone looks at, and  
**[0:03:21-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:03:21):**  I like the way you call these seminars skill exchange, because skilling up is the best  
**[0:03:28-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:03:28):**  thing anyone can do to get quicker at what you most need to do, and make sure that everything  
**[0:03:35-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:03:35):**  you do is done at the right time.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:03:37):**  That's why, for example, I'm really keen on making sure that people sow their seeds at  
**[0:03:41-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:03:41):**  the best time, and seed catalogues and packets give, I think, really bad information on that  
**[0:03:48-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:03:48):**  subject.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:03:49):**  They're not nearly specific enough.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:03:51):**  This is what I'm talking about, vegetables specifically here, and as a result, people  
**[0:03:56-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:03:56):**  are both wasting seeds and wasting time sowing the seeds for a very average result, if any,  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:04:02):**  at all, and that really breaks my heart, because in this kind of work, you cannot afford to  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:04:08):**  have those kinds of mistakes, you can actually afford to have very few mistakes.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:04:12):**  I've made a lot of mistakes on your behalf, not really, but I'm always trying things out,  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:04:18):**  and I'm very happy to share when things don't work as well as when they do work, but it's  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:04:24):**  something I think that does make my teaching strong, is that it's based on really having  
**[0:04:28-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:04:28):**  done it, and I've noticed in a lot of books and magazines, people are not really basing  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:04:36):**  it on that, they're just repeating what's already been said.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:04:39):**  So just to give you an example of that would be the four-year rotation, which when I started  
**[0:04:45-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:04:45):**  out in market gardening in the 1980s, I was absolutely gospel, and it was always held  
**[0:04:51-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:04:51):**  on too tight by organic farmers and growers, because they would say, we can't afford pesticides  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:04:58):**  and herbicides, so we need to get the soil health good, and that kind of thing, and then  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:05:04):**  they'd go out and use a rotator, and there wasn't the same interest in no-dig, no-till  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:05:09):**  that there is now, which has happened just recently, thank goodness, about time.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:05:15):**  And so that's the difference with no-dig, you can break so many of the rules, but you  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:05:21):**  just need to know which ones, and doing that opens up the door to being possibilities and  
**[0:05:27-0:05:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:05:27):**  being very efficient.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:05:28):**  So despite that timing being so essential for getting seeds in the ground, obviously  
**[0:05:33-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:05:33):**  there's the seasons that you need to take a look at, but there's a lot of interest in  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:05:37):**  the lunar cycles that correspond with the best germination rates for especially different,  
**[0:05:42-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:05:42):**  yeah, especially annuals.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:05:45):**  Can you talk about how necessary and how much you consider that in your planting schedule?  
**[0:05:49-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:05:49):**  Interesting question.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:05:52):**  I would say it's the icing on the cake.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:05:57):**  If you can get the lunar cycles into your work, that is fantastic, but the much more  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:06:02):**  important thing is to get all the basics right first, and that includes the soil.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:06:07):**  The soil is always the starting point, so that's where no-dig and looking after yourself  
**[0:06:11-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:06:11):**  correctly comes in.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:06:12):**  Then working with the sun, and that means basically working with the seasons.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:06:17):**  There's no good picking a date out of the lunar calendar if you're a week or two off  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:06:21):**  the best season for sowing that seed, and they don't always correspond unfortunately.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:06:26):**  So I don't know if any of you have heard of the two Russian scientists called Kolisko,  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:06:32):**  K-O-L-I-S-K-O, who worked in the Czech Republic in the 1920s and 30s.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:06:37):**  Actually, they were invited to do the work of Steinert just before he died, and what  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:06:43):**  they were looking at there was phases of the moon, interestingly, which means waxing, waning,  
**[0:06:48-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:06:48):**  not the later emphasis that Maria Thun has brought to it with the four seasons, the four  
**[0:06:54-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:06:54):**  aspect approach of earth, air, fire, and water.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:06:57):**  What the Koliskos found was that sowing two days before full moon gave you the biggest  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:07:02):**  harvest, rapid germination, and generally good, although they did say it's not always  
**[0:07:08-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:07:08):**  the healthiest outcome, but generally the biggest harvest.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:07:10):**  So that's quite a nice one to aim for, two days before full moon.

**[0:07:20-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:07:20):**  29 days to wait.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:07:23):**  So it does slightly contradict the later work done by Maria Matthias Thun on fair, fire,  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:07:29):**  water, and root, leaf, fruit, and flower.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:07:33):**  And I like to work with both of those, actually.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:07:36):**  So you've got choices there.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:07:38):**  And then, oh, God, there's so many places this discussion could go, but I will just  
**[0:07:42-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:07:42):**  mention one, actually.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:07:44):**  I'm starting to talk more about what I call energy gardening generally.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:07:49):**  There are some things that were known in the old days that have got forgotten, and I think  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:07:54):**  probably been a bit suppressed, actually, because there are things you can do which  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:07:59):**  cost you almost nothing, take almost no time, and give great results.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:08:05):**  Who wouldn't like that?  
**[0:08:06-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:08:06):**  Well, people who sell a lot of products, for example.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:08:09):**  It's that kind of thing that one is always up against.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:08:11):**  And actually, I'd even put biodynamic farming into that category because potentially it's  
**[0:08:16-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:08:16):**  a very cheap thing to do.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:08:18):**  You just need the knowledge.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:08:20):**  Maybe not too much, actually.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:08:21):**  I mean, I dabbled in biodynamics a little bit because I get slightly put off by the  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:08:27):**  almost incredible fervor of some biodynamic people.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:08:31):**  I hope I'm not offending anyone by saying that, but I'm sure you might not.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:08:35):**  I mean, I'm more of a pick and choose kind of person.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:08:37):**  I'll tell you what's good.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:08:38):**  We use biodynamic preparation 500g, the whole menu, which I don't make myself, but you can  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:08:43):**  buy it for £8, which is enough to do an acre, and then you do an hour of stirring, spread  
**[0:08:48-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:08:48):**  it on.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:08:49):**  And it's a very joyful process.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:08:50):**  You can think lovely thoughts while you're doing that, and that spreads to your land.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:08:54):**  But one in particular I'd love to mention, which was a practice done by flower farmers  
**[0:08:59-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:08:59):**  on the Isles of Scilly, which is extreme south west of the UK.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:09:02):**  It's a very mild part of the country.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:09:05):**  They would be sending daffodils up to the London market, and if they could get a week  
**[0:09:10-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:09:10):**  earlier, they would get a much better price, this would be like very early in the season,  
**[0:09:15-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:09:15):**  January, February.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:09:16):**  So they discovered a combination of solar energy and dowsing.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:09:22):**  The very simple thing they do is do this on the morning of the longest day, summer solstice,  
**[0:09:26-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:09:26):**  and you put five sticks in the ground around your property.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:09:30):**  So you put in the first stick, second stick, third stick, fourth stick, fifth stick, and  
**[0:09:34-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:09:34):**  you make any five-sided shape around so it can be totally irregular.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:09:41):**  Some people call this a pentagram, but it's not.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:09:43):**  Well, it kind of is, but it's not.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:09:46):**  If I use that word, again, I get in deep water because I've had people saying, oh, you're  
**[0:09:49-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:09:49):**  getting into superstition now.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:09:50):**  But it's not like that.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:09:52):**  Basically, what it does is it warms your soil, your property.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:09:57):**  And just that one simple thing takes about 20 minutes.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:10:00):**  And if you do it again a few times, we could do after that, it can even increase the effect.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:10:07):**  And if you want to find out more, put into search engine the name of the people who wrote  
**[0:10:13-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:10:13):**  this in 1982.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:10:16):**  They're called Tabraham, T-A-B-R, Tabra, A-H-A-M.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:10:21):**  So there you go.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:10:22):**  I've hesitated to share that one in public.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:10:24):**  I've known it for a long time and done it.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:10:26):**  But I'm feeling more and more that the world is ready for these kinds of things that previously  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:10:31):**  would have been condemned as superstitions.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:10:34):**  Superstition as labeled often by scientists is just because the scientists can't measure  
**[0:10:40-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:10:40):**  it.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:10:41):**  You know, we've got to a very narrow point, I think, with contemporary science where scientists  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:10:47):**  are reluctant to take on new ideas if it's outside their sphere of possible measuring.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:10:52):**  And then you've got the whole peer reviewed thing, which makes it even more of a closed  
**[0:10:55-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:10:55):**  circle.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:10:56):**  So I'll leave you with that.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:10:58):**  Now, that's brilliant because we've been having a number of these skill exchanges for a while.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:11:03):**  And I remember one in particular that we had with Harriet Mella, who's an independent researcher  
**[0:11:07-0:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:11:07):**  in Austria and has been connecting a lot of the science from various different disciplines  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:11:14):**  to what is happening in soil and what is happening with plants.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:11:18):**  And she talks a lot about the indicators that you can find for plant health without necessarily  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:11:23):**  having to do any digging or lab tests or chemistry.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:11:28):**  And I'm wondering what you found in your own experience with gardening as to the indicators.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:11:33):**  Like sometimes it's a feeling, sometimes it's something that you can see and point at that  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:11:37):**  give you an insight into the health of the plants that you're trying to care for and  
**[0:11:42-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:11:42):**  what you need to perhaps intervene in order to help them along.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:11:46):**  That's kind of both difficult and easy.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:11:49):**  I think it comes with experience.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:11:53):**  So you've got to get that experience.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:11:55):**  You've got to really look at your plants and pay attention.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:11:59):**  And behind that would always be the desire.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:12:02):**  You've got to have a desire for better growth in your plants, your fields.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:12:06):**  I remember when I started out and I just could not wait for my first spring that was 1983.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:12:12):**  I was making my growth in 1982.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:12:15):**  And I was excited.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:12:17):**  And I think that's a really good feeling because it gets your energy going.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:12:20):**  And then what I've noticed, like particularly my dig, no dig comparison beds, is that the  
**[0:12:26-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:12:26):**  plants, it helps if you have a baseline.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:12:29):**  So if you just look at a garden of plants, say that you're not too familiar with, you  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:12:36):**  won't be able to pick out some of these characteristics because you haven't got any reference point.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:12:41):**  But doing a dig, no dig trial beds has actually really helped me because what I've noticed  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:12:46):**  with the, where the soil has been cultivated, the plants do not have the same luster to  
**[0:12:51-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:12:51):**  their leaves.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:12:52):**  They're just a little bit less glossy.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:12:53):**  They're more matte.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:12:54):**  The green is a little bit more gray and metallic.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:12:57):**  It's not quite so bright yellow green and glowing.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:13:02):**  But these are small differences because what I found is that on a camera with the photograph,  
**[0:13:06-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:13:06):**  it's actually surprisingly difficult to pick them out.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:13:09):**  The camera can't, although only very slightly.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:13:13):**  And so that's showing, I think, how much we can, how much we can go beyond machines.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:13:17):**  I totally echo that point that you were saying, you know, is look at your plants.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:13:22):**  That's what I was going to tell you more than anything.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:13:24):**  And certainly, yeah, we obviously don't want to dig them up, but I've always been highly  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:13:27):**  skeptical of lab tests and I'm not saying there aren't good lab tests out there, but  
**[0:13:32-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:13:32):**  you know, you can learn so much more.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:13:33):**  Yeah, indeed.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:13:34):**  Just by watching your plants and in terms of actually helping them, that's maybe more  
**[0:13:38-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:13:38):**  difficult because, you know, we live in a world of rapid response and also science itself  
**[0:13:46-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:13:46):**  is very analytical and we're encouraged to think like that.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:13:49):**  You know, even your question is going a bit in that direction, I'd say, where you're trying  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:13:54):**  to pick out one or two things and often it's better to look at the whole, you know, think  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:13:59):**  in terms more of how can I make my soil better or maybe there was a sowing day I could have  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:14:04):**  improved or I need to water a bit more.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:14:07):**  Could be simple things like that.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:14:09):**  Watering is another skill, certainly an incredible skill to get familiar with.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:14:14):**  And it's one I talk about a lot because what I've noticed with beginners is often they'll  
**[0:14:18-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:14:18):**  over water and plants definitely don't look so good then.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:14:25):**  They need to look, well, it goes in the colour of the leaf will look a bit flabby if you've  
**[0:14:31-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:14:31):**  been over watering.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:14:34):**  One nice tip for watering actually is between watering you want to see the surface of your  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:14:38):**  soil compost dry out.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:14:40):**  You know, it's actually good for the surface to be a bit dry before you water again.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:14:43):**  There's no way you should try and keep it moist all the time.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:14:47):**  So yeah, there are clues.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:14:51):**  Certainly now, given that you're best known for your no dig techniques and for promoting  
**[0:14:57-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:14:57):**  this as a gardening method, compost and the top dressing method, which really mimics the  
**[0:15:03-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:15:03):**  way that nature builds soil.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:15:05):**  Obviously, it doesn't insert things or dig things up and put amendments down in deeper  
**[0:15:10-0:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:15:10):**  layers.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:15:11):**  It builds it from the top.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:15:13):**  And this was the subject that we just sort of ran out of time with on the last expert  
**[0:15:17-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:15:17):**  call.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:15:18):**  Can you talk about some of the, I guess, key pieces of information to know about making  
**[0:15:25-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:15:25):**  good compost?  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:15:26):**  Because variations are everywhere and everybody is working with slightly different subsoil  
**[0:15:31-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:15:31):**  as a basis.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:15:32):**  You were talking about how the fungal and microbial life is really what's key to making  
**[0:15:38-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:15:38):**  the most of the base minerals that you're working with.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:15:41):**  And so to promote those in the composting process, what are sort of the rules that you  
**[0:15:45-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:15:45):**  focus on?  
**[0:15:46-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:15:46):**  Yeah, certainly.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:15:47):**  I mean, when I started making compost in the 1980s, it was not considered a particularly  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:15:56):**  important part of things.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:15:57):**  And also in those days, people were concentrating much more on the chemical composition nutrients  
**[0:16:02-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:16:02):**  and I remember my brother, who was a non-organic farmer at the time, saying quite scornfully,  
**[0:16:09-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:16:09):**  you know, there's hardly any NPK in your compost.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:16:12):**  I'll stick to using fertilizer.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:16:14):**  So when the climate of understanding was like that, one didn't feel great confidence in  
**[0:16:21-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:16:21):**  using compost or promoting it to the world.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:16:23):**  Now it's very different because we have got these microbial understandings and what we're  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:16:27):**  realizing is the value of compost is much more than the nutrients it contains and it  
**[0:16:32-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:16:32):**  is indeed the microbes.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:16:34):**  And we're learning all the time.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:16:36):**  So this is what anyone can join in because, you know, you can all make fascinating compost.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:16:42):**  You can all have a great time doing it as well.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:16:44):**  And what you will find is that you learn every time.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:16:48):**  What I notice when I'm teaching here, like, you know, running a course at Homeacres and  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:16:52):**  we're talking about the garden, no-dig, then we get to the composting and the level of  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:16:56):**  interest, which is already pretty high, it really goes up a notch and people's eyes light  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:17:00):**  up and it can become quite a passionate thing, making good compost.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:17:05):**  At the same time, as you know, going back to how you phrased it in your question Oliver,  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:17:09):**  as you said, you know, it's kind of part of the natural process and yet in a way it's  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:17:14):**  a knot because there's no way in nature you'll go out and see a compost heap, certainly not  
**[0:17:19-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:17:19):**  one that we make.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:17:21):**  And also in nature, and this is something I'm often asked, you know, debris is falling  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:17:25):**  on the surface all the time, decaying vegetation and it decays into situ.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:17:30):**  So it's a different process, if you like, very biological still, but not the same as  
**[0:17:35-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:17:35):**  you find in the compost heap.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:17:36):**  So there's two aspects to that.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:17:39):**  One is that why do we not want to just let the stuff fall on the surface?  
**[0:17:43-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:17:43):**  You know, why do we bother making a compost heap?  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:17:46):**  The reason is, well, partly in a damp climate, you know, I'll often come back to this one,  
**[0:17:51-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:17:51):**  if you leave old leaves to go yellow and rot on the surface, you'll get a lot of slugs.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:17:58):**  So just in terms of growing plants, it can be quite an issue.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:18:02):**  Whereas if you take them to compost heap, obviously you're bypassing that.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:18:04):**  And then you're keeping yourself, what some people say, you know, let's say your beds  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:18:09):**  are bare, but no, they're not because they've got this much of compost, which looks a bit  
**[0:18:13-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:18:13):**  like so.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:18:14):**  And that doesn't harbour pests like the slugs and snails, but also I feel it's harbouring  
**[0:18:19-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:18:19):**  a lot of really good things that we don't see, such as the small microorganisms, microorganisms.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:18:27):**  And also, you know, you're just allowing a whole network of, if I keep with the slug  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:18:31):**  examples, beetles that eat slug eggs and that kind of thing, they're all encouraged to thrive.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:18:36):**  So going back to the compost heap and how we can improve it and make it most valuable.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:18:42):**  There are two main aspects to it.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:18:43):**  If you get it really hot, you will have mostly bacteria in there.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:18:47):**  And some of them are called thermophilic bacteria, that's the ones that survive even up to 80  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:18:51):**  centigrade.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:18:52):**  And those of you who've bought what we call green waste compost, that's been made from  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:18:56):**  garden waste in big operations facilities where they've got a lot of machinery, they  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:19:01):**  shred the wood and then they turn the compost maybe every three days and you see these parts  
**[0:19:05-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:19:05):**  steaming away.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:19:07):**  That's not so good actually.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:19:08):**  And I know that Elaine England hates that.

**[0:19:15-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:19:15):**  have made it up really, going from the airport to the hotel.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:19:19):**  We happened to pass a place where they were doing this and it was a big pile of black  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:19:22):**  compost and she insisted to stop the car and hopped out and she had a look and really shaking  
**[0:19:26-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:19:26):**  her head.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:19:27):**  And two things that you're losing there is, one is the fungal microbes.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:19:31):**  I mean, she might phrase this a bit more precisely, but I'm giving you a brief description.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:19:38):**  And the other thing you're missing is the, you are losing carbon.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:19:43):**  You know, all the turning exposes carbon, it's a bit like digging, you're losing carbon  
**[0:19:46-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:19:46):**  to the air.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:19:47):**  I mean, that's one of the great things about Nardig, we're keeping all the carbon in the  
**[0:19:50-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:19:50):**  soil, which you say already.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:19:52):**  So I recommend not turning, certainly not turning, not the Berkeley method where you  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:19:57):**  turn it every five days and get the compost in 28 days or whatever, it might be 40 and  
**[0:20:01-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:20:01):**  even some people claim, you don't need to go there.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:20:04):**  You know, let natural processes do it.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:20:06):**  But I do find that one turn can really help and it both speeds it up, gives you a more  
**[0:20:10-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:20:10):**  even compost at the end.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:20:12):**  And we'll do our one turn after, say, six weeks.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:20:16):**  Once we've finished it, we'll let it cool down.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:20:18):**  Our heaps take about six weeks to make here.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:20:21):**  These are ballpark figures.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:20:23):**  I don't want you to copy me, you know, that don't think, oh, I've got to make even six  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:20:26):**  weeks just because the child said so, whatever, you know, just, you've got to go with the  
**[0:20:31-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:20:31):**  flow with making compost and it fits into your system.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:20:34):**  So that's why that's like, there's no right or wrong, but I'm just giving you some ideas  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:20:37):**  of how we do it, what fits into this garden, which is now about a third of an acre.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:20:42):**  And that's enough to make.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:20:43):**  It's hard to be precise because we're bringing in a bit of material, but maybe six, seven  
**[0:20:48-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:20:48):**  times a year.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:20:49):**  You know, it depends how many edges you've got.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:20:52):**  And over the years, I've been anxious that we haven't been making enough.  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:20:57):**  You know, I don't like importing material.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:20:58):**  Well, actually, this raises a whole another question.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:21:01):**  Should we be importing material or should we be a closed farm system?  
**[0:21:05-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:21:05):**  And when Rudolf Steiner first came out with that idea in his first lectures in 1924, you  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:21:10):**  know, closed farm system, well, that was different in those days.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:21:13):**  And farms were, well, most of them had animals, one thing.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:21:16):**  And so, you know, it made more sense.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:21:19):**  But all I would say here is if or for market garden, you know, we're selling a lot of stuff  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:21:23):**  from from this small area and my customers do not bring their poo back to my compost  
**[0:21:28-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:21:28):**  use.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:21:29):**  So therefore, how can I close my system?  
**[0:21:33-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:21:33):**  You know, if you look at it in those terms, I don't think there's any benefit in being  
**[0:21:36-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:21:36):**  too un-political about that.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:21:37):**  But certainly you can use most of your own waste and don't be afraid of importing waste  
**[0:21:41-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:21:41):**  from other people.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:21:42):**  And we do that in order to get enough green material.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:21:45):**  Green material means the fast acting, either fresh green leaves or material with quite  
**[0:21:50-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:21:50):**  high nitrogen.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:21:51):**  So that would be say very fresh horse manure or coffee grounds, even coffee grounds, quite  
**[0:21:56-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:21:56):**  high nitrogen.  
**[0:21:57-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:21:57):**  And so you mix enough of them in.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:21:59):**  We do in volume terms, it's probably about three quarter green, one quarter brown.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:22:03):**  But the brown is one of the most important parts because that's more woody material.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:22:09):**  In the last five years, I reckon pretty much every year I put a bit more brown in because  
**[0:22:13-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:22:13):**  I'm I'm I'm seeing the value of it.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:22:16):**  And then you're left with a compost that still has some bits of wood, not big ones.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:22:19):**  You just want small ones.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:22:21):**  We cut all the pieces of wood or shred them.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:22:23):**  And then when that compost is spread, you can still see bits of wood.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:22:26):**  And what I'm finding in the soil as a result of doing that, particularly in the last five  
**[0:22:30-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:22:30):**  years since since I've watched Shredder, I could then we can shred green wood all through  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:22:34):**  the late spring, summer and early autumn particularly.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:22:38):**  The microbes in the soil, the fungal part of the soil seems to be increasing.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:22:42):**  And we're quite from we'll make a whole set of plant potatoes or a tomato or something  
**[0:22:47-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:22:47):**  because otherwise we're not looking in the soil very much.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:22:49):**  And we'll find these white, white masses, masses of mycelium, I guess.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:22:54):**  I've got a guy coming with a microscope next week and I want him to look more closely at  
**[0:22:59-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:22:59):**  these actually and find out what is in there.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:23:00):**  But again, there's so much to find out.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:23:03):**  I've just come across this and it seems very similar to what is in Korean farming is called  
**[0:23:08-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:23:08):**  indigenous microorganisms.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:23:09):**  You know, totally from the property as a result of composting in a certain way, not letting  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:23:13):**  the heat get too hot.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:23:15):**  Just to finish on that one, the temperature I look to keep below 70 and usually around  
**[0:23:20-0:23:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:23:20):**  60.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:23:21):**  And this is not as difficult as it might sound once you get a bit of practice.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:23:24):**  So again, it's skill just buy yourself a cheap, quite long compost thermometer, maybe 40 centimetre.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:23:31):**  We get them for 10 pound off Amazon or electric thermometer, instruments company, whatever  
**[0:23:35-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:23:35):**  it might be.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:23:36):**  And use that.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:23:38):**  That's your best indication of what's going on in your compost heap.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:23:42):**  And if you keep the range between 50 and 70, I'd say you're doing really well.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:23:46):**  But you won't do that in the winter.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:23:47):**  There's not enough green material in this.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:23:48):**  You've got horses for fresh manure.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:23:51):**  And don't worry about that.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:23:52):**  You know, worry less.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:23:54):**  Those people get very concerned about their compost making.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:23:57):**  And, you know, it's not a precise science, but you just follow these very simple guidelines  
**[0:24:02-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:24:02):**  and try a few things and see how it works for you.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:24:05):**  And if the temperature doesn't ever get hot, you can also make great compost.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:24:09):**  It'll be more fungal.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:24:10):**  It'll take a bit longer, but it'll be good.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:24:12):**  You just will have wheat seeds.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:24:13):**  So that's not the end of the world.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:24:17):**  Yeah, there really is.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:24:18):**  There's so much variety in this and there's so many different variables with the ingredients  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:24:23):**  that you put in, the time of year, the amount of moisture, the heat at that time.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:24:27):**  But like you said, that's not necessarily a bad thing.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:24:30):**  You don't need to micromanage it.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:24:32):**  It does mostly take care of itself.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:24:35):**  You know, there is this larger conversation that's going on, especially when it comes  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:24:39):**  to growing vegetables, that there's an ideal level of soil health and plant health that  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:24:44):**  you can get to where they are completely immune to diseases and bugs and any other kind of  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:24:50):**  external damage, say for, you know, some big massive storm.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:24:56):**  Have you seen this as a possibility or do you still focus on managing pests and diseases  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:25:03):**  in a natural way and aspiring for these higher levels of health?  
**[0:25:08-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:25:08):**  Okay, that's interesting.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:25:11):**  Yes and no.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:25:12):**  I certainly find that getting the soil right and getting the sowing dates right takes you  
**[0:25:18-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:25:18):**  maybe 80% of the way.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:25:20):**  But what I'm still doing unnaturally, you know, vegetable garden, it's hard to copy  
**[0:25:26-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:25:26):**  nature completely in the forest and see a bed of carrots, for example.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:25:35):**  You know, that's where we're doing something unnatural and so you can get a pest.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:25:39):**  In this case, it would be one of the most difficult ones I find is carrot root fly.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:25:43):**  So it's little flies.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:25:44):**  I don't know if I've even ever seen a carrot root fly.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:25:45):**  They're very small, apparently.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:25:48):**  And I use mesh covers to keep them out.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:25:51):**  And even then I'm not totally successful.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:25:53):**  They do help.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:25:54):**  So I am using covers quite a bit.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:25:57):**  It's rare that my garden is ever totally covered.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:26:00):**  I'm very selective.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:26:01):**  You know, if you get clever with covers, you can just move them around.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:26:04):**  You don't need huge numbers.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:26:07):**  Just putting them on your plantings at the most susceptible time.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:26:11):**  And again, that comes back to skill and knowledge of knowing that and doing it quickly and efficiently.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:26:17):**  So for example, all brassica plantings in the summer, I cover with mesh because there  
**[0:26:24-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:26:24):**  are so many brassica insects at that time of year.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:26:26):**  So this would be say plantings with broccoli, swedes, Brussels sprouts that are going to  
**[0:26:31-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:26:31):**  crop in the autumn, winter when they're going out of small plants in early summer.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:26:35):**  And there's still flea beetles, there's thrips, there's butterflies starting to, and moss  
**[0:26:40-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:26:40):**  and just everything that likes doing brassica leaves.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:26:42):**  And I find just a six week period of covering those seedlings at that time, then take it  
**[0:26:47-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:26:47):**  off.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:26:48):**  I don't like having plants covered all the time.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:26:50):**  But obviously you can't see them, you can't respond.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:26:52):**  Difficult to pull weeds out, not that you do a lot of that.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:26:54):**  But just generally, it's nice for uncovering.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:26:57):**  So yeah, I think there's an element where it would be difficult to copy nature.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:27:03):**  You could then go down the road of polycropping is one phrase for that where you don't grow  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:27:08):**  anything of one block altogether, but you'd have Brussels sprout here, Brussels sprout  
**[0:27:12-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:27:12):**  there, blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:27:14):**  Yes and no.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:27:16):**  We've all got to run an efficient operation and harvesting takes much longer if you've  
**[0:27:22-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:27:22):**  got one plant here and one plant there.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:27:24):**  In a small garden, this is not maybe so relevant, but in a money making operation, hopefully,  
**[0:27:30-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:27:30):**  this is a really important factor.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:27:32):**  So again, there are so many factors to consider, but polyculture is a way to go.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:27:38):**  I'll just say on that one, actually, a really nice thing I'm finding more and more is the  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:27:41):**  possibility of inter planting, coming back to the mycorrhizal network.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:27:47):**  Three weeks ago, we transplanted some chervil between some lettuce and then we're picking  
**[0:27:51-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:27:51):**  the lettuce weekly.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:27:53):**  I'm convinced that chervil has grown faster for being between the lettuces.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:27:56):**  It's growing like a rocket, even in late September, early October.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:28:00):**  And I reckon that when you get nice combinations of plants together, which are mainly specific  
**[0:28:07-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:28:07):**  according to the season and space requirements, I don't think it's so much that certain plants  
**[0:28:13-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:28:13):**  like or don't like other plants.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:28:15):**  It's more that the conditions of growing suit them both at the same time.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:28:19):**  And for example, fennel is an example of that.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:28:22):**  Apparently fennel's got a really bad name, bold fennel, Florence fennel, for not being  
**[0:28:26-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:28:26):**  friends with many plants.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:28:27):**  And I use it commonly actually as an interplant, we just did it with cucumbers and there they  
**[0:28:32-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:28:32):**  go.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:28:33):**  Then we clear the cucumbers after the fennel's been planted between it for about a month.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:28:37):**  And before you know, you've got a fennel harvest as well.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:28:40):**  So inter planting like that, where the plant roots, I'm sure, are connecting and talking  
**[0:28:44-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:28:44):**  in a positive way, you know, rather than this really old fashioned idea of competing.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:28:49):**  Although that would only happen if you say plant the lettuce right next to a courgette  
**[0:28:53-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:28:53):**  or zucchini plant, because that courgette squash plant is going to grow so fast, it's  
**[0:28:59-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:28:59):**  just going to completely overpower the lettuce.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:29:00):**  It's not that they didn't like each other.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:29:02):**  It's just that, you know, it's actually got it wrong in that situation.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:29:05):**  So that's where a bit of knowledge comes in.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:29:06):**  But yeah, there are so many possibilities for improving health of plants.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:29:10):**  It always starts with the soil for sure.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:29:13):**  And beyond that, find out your own combinations that can work for you.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:29:16):**  And these kinds of inter planting things is possible.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:29:18):**  But don't don't have too much dispersion through your garden maybe.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:29:22):**  Sure, the common paradox of diversity and efficiency.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:29:28):**  So many growers are constantly battling.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:29:30):**  Well, so look, there's so many different ways that I could take this and I have so many  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/charles-dowding-teaches-the-essentials-for-a-productive-no-dig-veggie-garden/#t=0:29:34):**  more questions that I would love to ask, but I feel it only right to hand it over to the

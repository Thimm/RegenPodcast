**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:01:14):**  Hello and welcome to the first episode in season two of the Abundant Edge podcast.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:01:19):**  We have so many exciting interviews and information coming up for you in 2018, and this week's  
**[0:01:23-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:01:23):**  session is a perfect example of that.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:01:26):**  Today we're going to be speaking with Mark Shepherd of New Forest Farm in Viola, Wisconsin,  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:01:30):**  an author of Restoration Agriculture, one of the most iconic books on profitable regenerative  
**[0:01:35-0:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:01:35):**  production methods anywhere.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:01:37):**  Now I've been a big fan of Mark's work and teaching since I first saw his farm profiled  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:01:41):**  on a remarkable documentary called Inhabit that highlights inspiring examples of permaculture  
**[0:01:46-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:01:46):**  around the USA.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:01:48):**  Mark is a no-nonsense advocate of farming methods and enterprises that are not only  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:01:52):**  sustainable but actually restore their ecosystem and increase the carrying capacity of life  
**[0:01:57-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:01:57):**  around them.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:01:59):**  In this interview, Mark talks about his unique journey that brought him to conclusions about  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:02:02):**  how humans should interact with nature and take care of their resources.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:02:06):**  He goes into detail about how he determines if a farm enterprise will be worth the effort  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:02:11):**  and resources invested in it, and how to plan for the long-term development of perennial  
**[0:02:16-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:02:16):**  systems while still bringing in an income.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:02:19):**  Mark also gives sound advice on how to acquire land, build equity, and grow your business  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:02:23):**  by navigating the capitalist system that many people in the alternative communities have  
**[0:02:27-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:02:27):**  written off entirely.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:02:29):**  This is a very insightful talk that may push your buttons a little if you're not familiar  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:02:33):**  with Mark's teachings, but I urge you to keep an open mind and remember how much Mark's  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:02:37):**  results speak for themselves.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:02:39):**  Now before I give too much away, I'll turn things over to Mark Shepherd.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:02:42):**  Hey Mark, thanks so much for making time for us today.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:02:45):**  How you doing?  
**[0:02:46-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:02:46):**  Oh, doing all right.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:02:47):**  A little tired and a little bit cold with the winter weather here in Wisconsin.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:02:51):**  Yeah, you got to come down and visit me here in Guatemala.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:02:54):**  It's sunny and about 78 degrees.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:02:57):**  You can, well 78 is nice.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:03:00):**  Any more than 85.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:03:01):**  See, thing is you can always put more clothes on, but you can only get so naked.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:03:05):**  No, we have like this perfect medium climate here, especially around this time.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:03:10):**  It gets cold in the evenings, but it's otherwise gorgeous during the day.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:03:13):**  Nice little breeze.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:03:14):**  We're loving it here on this time.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:03:17):**  What's the seasonal rainfall pattern like there?  
**[0:03:20-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:03:20):**  Is it monsoon?  
**[0:03:21-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:03:21):**  Is it fairly regular?  
**[0:03:22-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:03:22):**  What's it like?  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:03:23):**  Yeah, we get a very serious rainy season with the odd hurricane coming through every couple  
**[0:03:28-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:03:28):**  of years.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:03:29):**  We missed it last year, but it's about half half.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:03:32):**  So dry season, wet season, and we got about 84 inches of rain a year.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:03:36):**  So pretty significant.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:03:40):**  But it's good.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:03:41):**  It gets us through the entire dry season, which is when all the tourism comes here.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:03:45):**  It's when we do our courses and stuff.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:03:46):**  So it's a good mix.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:03:47):**  But hey, so look, I'm a really big fan of your work and I've been incredibly inspired  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:03:51):**  by your story, but even more with your progress and the process that which you've gotten to  
**[0:03:57-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:03:57):**  where you are.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:03:58):**  And I've got a lot that I'm looking forward to asking you about.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:04:01):**  So how about we just jump right into the first questions?  
**[0:04:04-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:04:04):**  Let's jump.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:04:05):**  All right.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:04:06):**  So could you start by explaining a bit about your background and how you first became interested  
**[0:04:09-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:04:09):**  in regenerative agriculture and permaculture?  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:04:12):**  Oh, yeah.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:04:15):**  Geez.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:04:16):**  Well, I actually grew up in industrial wasteland, north central Massachusetts in the 1960s and  
**[0:04:25-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:04:25):**  1970s when there was the great outsourcing of American industries to export all the jobs  
**[0:04:32-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:04:32):**  overseas and tremendous unemployment, inflation and all that kind of stuff.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:04:40):**  One of the things that's interesting, I'm going to sneeze.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:04:42):**  It's going to come up pretty soon here.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:04:45):**  Take your time.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:04:46):**  Excuse me.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:04:47):**  Don't worry, I won't edit that out.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:04:50):**  You don't have to.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:04:53):**  That's all right.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:04:54):**  And what was fascinating about it, which it's a whole other set of stories nested within  
**[0:04:59-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:04:59):**  stories, is my dad was a biodynamic gardener ever since he was a kid.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:05:06):**  And at the time, he was one of only a handful on the whole continent that was using the  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:05:11):**  biodynamic preparations and making the biodynamic preparations.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:05:15):**  So I grew up thinking that biodynamics and organic was normal.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:05:21):**  Well, so gardening was a big part of my growing up.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:05:27):**  Well then all this economic crises hit, dad's unemployed for long periods of time.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:05:32):**  Then the whole 1974 oil embargo kind of hit.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:05:39):**  And in the background of this, remember we're in this crumbling industrial wasteland, all  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:05:43):**  the factories and smokestacks along the river.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:05:46):**  And the river was quite spectacular because the big game every day when we got into the  
**[0:05:51-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:05:51):**  car was to guess what color the river is today.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:05:53):**  It'd be blue, it'd be green, it'd be red, it'd be yellow, it'd be orange, it'd be on  
**[0:05:56-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:05:56):**  fire.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:05:58):**  And it was in 1975, I think, when the Cuyahoga River in Ohio caught on fire.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:06:04):**  I kind of tug on my mom's shirt and say, hey mom, why did the Cuyahoga River make the news  
**[0:06:09-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:06:09):**  when our river catches on fire once every other week or so?  
**[0:06:13-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:06:13):**  Isn't that what rivers do?  
**[0:06:14-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:06:14):**  Now it was kind of like a wake up call that no, rivers aren't supposed to do that.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:06:20):**  They're supposed to flow clear with water and there's fish in them.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:06:24):**  What a concept.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:06:26):**  Yeah, right.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:06:28):**  The oil embargo hit and my dad started gardening in earnest, which meant that the oldest boy  
**[0:06:35-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:06:35):**  had to be the most responsible.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:06:37):**  And so here I was out in the garden slaving the arse off to grow some tomatoes and cucumbers  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:06:43):**  and carrots and broccolis and all that kind of stuff that really didn't feed us.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:06:48):**  It was our vitamins and minerals and all that, but we still had to go to the store to buy  
**[0:06:51-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:06:51):**  our staple foods, our meat and pasta and bread.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:06:57):**  And then of course, because of the oil embargo, we also got a wood stove because we had about  
**[0:07:02-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:07:02):**  10 acres of woods.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:07:03):**  Nowadays it would be considered a farmette, I guess.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:07:07):**  And so my job being the oldest, of course, was to go down in the woods and cut firewood.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:07:13):**  Well while I was out in the woods I could harvest grapes and blueberries and wintergreen  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:07:17):**  berries and all kinds of greens and hickory nuts and hazelnuts.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:07:22):**  And it just was a head scratcher to me.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:07:25):**  Why on earth are we working our arses off in a garden for just a couple of carrots that  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:07:31):**  swim in the soup when we can go out in the woods and not have to like plant anything,  
**[0:07:35-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:07:35):**  hoe anything, weed control, mulch making compost.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:07:38):**  Oh my gosh, the compost I turned in my life as a kid was just not funny.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:07:43):**  And so there was this huge contrast.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:07:46):**  I couldn't really make sense of it until I read the book Tree Crops by J. Russell Smith,  
**[0:07:54-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:07:54):**  originally written in 1926.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:07:57):**  And that really got me to thinking, it's like, well yeah, let's grow our animal feeds, because  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:08:01):**  in his day about 50% of all the annual crops were fed the livestock.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:08:06):**  Let's grow our animal feed in trees because a pig doesn't care if it's eaten an acorn  
**[0:08:11-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:08:11):**  or a corn kernel.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:08:13):**  And then let's grow our crops in the flat land underneath the trees.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:08:18):**  And that was the first place that I ever saw the words permanent agriculture put together,  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:08:23):**  because the book's title was Tree Crops, a Permanent Agriculture.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:08:27):**  And throughout the whole book he starts talking about permanent agriculture, the collapses  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:08:32):**  of civilization, soil erosion, on and on and on.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:08:36):**  So I was pre-loaded for the idea of permanent agriculture, permaculture, when it actually  
**[0:08:45-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:08:45):**  finally did come along later on.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:08:48):**  I think I first heard about it maybe I was in my teens, late teens, thereabouts.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:08:54):**  So let's move forward to the present day.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:08:57):**  Your iconic property, New Forest Farm, in Viola, Wisconsin is an inspiring example of  
**[0:09:01-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:09:01):**  multiple agricultural and land management techniques such as silvopasture, keyline systems,  
**[0:09:08-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:09:08):**  permaculture methods and others.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:09:09):**  Could you give a few examples of how these techniques work together to create multiple  
**[0:09:13-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:09:13):**  enterprises that work in sync?  
**[0:09:16-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:09:16):**  Boy, it sounds like a simple question, but I'm sure if anybody actually listens to the  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:09:22):**  question that you asked there's like 55 million things in there.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:09:26):**  We can break them down, we can take them piece by piece.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:09:29):**  Yeah, well, kind of, so we'll continue a little bit on the biography first because it leads  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:09:34):**  into how this turned into what it did.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:09:40):**  In high school I graduated, went to school for mechanical engineering because I got a  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:09:46):**  scholarship to go to that school and they had a great wrestling team and that's what  
**[0:09:50-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:09:50):**  I wanted to do.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:09:52):**  I got out, got an engineering job, I failed to thrive, I hated it, I worked there for  
**[0:09:57-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:09:57):**  about a year and I quit and I went back to school for ecology at Unity College in Maine.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:10:08):**  While I was there I'm studying all about natural plant communities and forest succession and  
**[0:10:14-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:10:14):**  soil development, all these basic terrestrial ecological understanding and then it was time  
**[0:10:25-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:10:25):**  for me to decide whether I should actually continue my education or I read this little  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:10:34):**  article in Yankee Magazine that talked about the closing of the Homestead Act forever up  
**[0:10:39-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:10:39):**  in Alaska and I figured that if I didn't stick out my thumb and give it a try I'd probably  
**[0:10:46-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:10:46):**  regret it for the rest of my life and so I took off to Alaska and claimed land about  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:10:53):**  300 miles northeast of Anchorage, 5 miles off the nearest road, 6 hour drive to town  
**[0:10:58-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:10:58):**  once I got there, 3500 feet up the side of the mountain and all of a sudden I found myself  
**[0:11:04-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:11:04):**  broke and cold in the sub-Arctic alpine zone and said alright, how do I feed myself without  
**[0:11:13-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:11:13):**  destroying this place?  
**[0:11:15-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:11:15):**  I drew upon a lot of my ecological education, a lot of observation because I was out in  
**[0:11:23-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:11:23):**  the middle of it and then some study of what the native cultures had done for subsistence  
**[0:11:31-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:11:31):**  while they were there and I started to interact with my environment and treat the whole entire  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:11:39):**  environment as instead of being a hunter-gatherer that goes over here to harvest these berries  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:11:44):**  and over there to get this, I'd plant them all in relationship with one another and I  
**[0:11:49-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:11:49):**  started writing notes about it and I brought those notes to a friend of mine and he said  
**[0:11:53-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:11:53):**  oh that book's already been written, it's called Permaculture and so I got all the books  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:11:59):**  at the time that had been written on Permaculture which was Permaculture 1 and Permaculture  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:12:03):**  2, the hardcover edition of the designer's manual hadn't even been printed yet and I  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:12:09):**  realized that Mollison was onto something with this designing ecosystems was just a  
**[0:12:14-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:12:14):**  great idea and so I of course continued my education reading, eventually got the hardcover  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:12:22):**  Permaculture book, went through that millions of times cover to cover trying to understand  
**[0:12:27-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:12:27):**  it and the thing was I was living in my environment and absolutely applying everything that I  
**[0:12:33-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:12:33):**  possibly could at the time.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:12:36):**  So after I kind of, you know, I had this notion that I'd kind of figured it out and one of  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:12:44):**  the keys to quote unquote figuring it out is one of the first things that Bill Mollison  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:12:50):**  recommends in the Permaculture designer's manual, one of the first things that David  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:12:54):**  Holmgren mentions in Permaculture Pathways Beyond Sustainability or whatever that book  
**[0:12:59-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:12:59):**  was, is to observe nature, to imitate nature, then to interact with that, accept feedback  
**[0:13:09-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:13:09):**  and adapt and it was at that time I started to go to Permaculture meetings and workshops  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:13:18):**  and all that kind of stuff and I realized that people were drastically missing point  
**[0:13:23-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:13:23):**  number one as far as observing nature was concerned and it's continued to this day that  
**[0:13:31-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:13:31):**  Permaculture has continued to miss the boat of observing nature and interacting with it  
**[0:13:38-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:13:38):**  and designing after nature.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:13:41):**  So when I finally decided that instead of just doing a cute little Permaculture backyard  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:13:49):**  with a couple of berry bushes and a nut shrub and all that stuff, let's do this, let's design  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:13:54):**  a property so that it actually has enough of a product that you can harvest.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:14:00):**  It is enough of a product to justify the investment in the equipment to harvest it, storage facilities,  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:14:07):**  processing facilities and you can get it on a truck and actually pay your bills that way.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:14:12):**  So that requires a certain scale.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:14:15):**  So when we moved to Southwest Wisconsin, the very first thing I did is like, alright, observe  
**[0:14:21-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:14:21):**  nature, all the different textbooks and pre-settlement vegetation maps and stuff like that and where  
**[0:14:29-0:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:14:29):**  we are is right at the boundary between three different fairly distinct habitat types.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:14:36):**  One is the oak savanna, another is the big woods region which is sugar maple basswood,  
**[0:14:42-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:14:42):**  primarily sugar maple basswood and then the other is further north into pine, mixed pine  
**[0:14:51-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:14:51):**  northern hardwoods.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:14:53):**  And so what you do is you go to any place online, you just do a search for your state,  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:14:59):**  go to Michigan natural plant communities and then you look at these different natural plant  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:15:04):**  communities and you look at the species list and you cherry pick the ones that will produce  
**[0:15:10-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:15:10):**  food, fuels, medicines, fibers or things that you can sell.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:15:14):**  And so the oak savanna right where we are right here, the highest layer, the canopy  
**[0:15:22-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:15:22):**  layer would be phagases which are oak, chestnut or beech.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:15:25):**  They have big nuts, all three of them.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:15:28):**  An understory or kind of a sharing that canopy story would be cherries.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:15:33):**  The prunuses are cherries, apricots, plums, etc.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:15:37):**  They're represented in all the different layers, everything from ground growing prunuses to  
**[0:15:43-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:15:43):**  full size tree size prunuses.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:15:45):**  Then under that was a layer of apples and critagas, hawthorn and apples.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:15:55):**  The dominant shrub in this region was hazelnut.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:15:59):**  Cane fruits were raspberries and blackberries.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:16:02):**  Vines were grapes.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:16:04):**  Of course there was grass all over the place and the grass was managed by livestock that  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:16:09):**  wandered around.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:16:13):**  That sounds like, of course there's all this biomass that's going to decay so there's fungus  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:16:17):**  decaying all this biomass.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:16:19):**  Now if you just listen to all the things I listed, chestnuts, cherries, apples, hazelnuts,  
**[0:16:26-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:16:26):**  grapes, raspberries, blackberries, currants in the shade, fungus, grass and animals.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:16:33):**  Which one of those is an annual plant that you have to plow the ground and plant it every  
**[0:16:38-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:16:38):**  single year?  
**[0:16:39-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:16:39):**  Not a single one, yeah.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:16:41):**  100% perennial system.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:16:43):**  All around the world, every biome has perennial plant communities that thrive under those  
**[0:16:50-0:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:16:50):**  conditions and every habitat around the world has the plant communities that will support  
**[0:16:57-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:16:57):**  human societies if we observe nature, imitate what nature has for us in a pattern and then  
**[0:17:04-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:17:04):**  interact with it and manage that and how we manage it mostly is by harvesting yields.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:17:11):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:17:13):**  And within that diversity that you've listed, you've got quite a few different management  
**[0:17:18-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:17:18):**  styles to keep them rotating and in full production for as much of the year as possible.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:17:25):**  How do those work in conjunction with one another for the benefit of the entire system?  
**[0:17:30-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:17:30):**  Well keeping it in production for as long as possible isn't necessarily the objective  
**[0:17:38-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:17:38):**  here.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:17:39):**  The objective here is for me to have a livelihood to be able to pay my bills and feed myself  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:17:43):**  and my family and friends and that kind of stuff, have a reasonable economy.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:17:48):**  Well the most cost effective way to manage a natural system, now if you understand what  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:17:56):**  we did is we created a mimicked oak savanna, that's the majority of what we've got.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:18:02):**  We've got other plant community types too but I'll just focus on the oak savanna one.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:18:07):**  The natural management tools and techniques that managed oak savannas for the millennia  
**[0:18:15-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:18:15):**  that they've been around, for the zillions of years that they've been around has been  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:18:18):**  fire, wind and animals, browsing and grazing.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:18:23):**  So wind typically knocks woody plants over, the roots pull up either completely or partially  
**[0:18:32-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:18:32):**  from the soil.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:18:34):**  So that means that now you have a depression, that's the pit, and then this mound which  
**[0:18:40-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:18:40):**  is the roots mixed with mineral soil.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:18:42):**  So what you have is you have an excavated pit and you have a mound where you've got  
**[0:18:48-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:18:48):**  mixed wood and organic matter.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:18:51):**  So wait a minute, that sounds a little bit like plowing to a certain extent that we mix  
**[0:18:56-0:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:18:56):**  the organic matter with the mineral soil.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:18:58):**  And actually it sounds a lot to me like making a swale.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:19:02):**  You make an excavated depression here and then a mound over there and guess what happens  
**[0:19:07-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:19:07):**  in the depression?  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:19:09):**  Water will accumulate there, leaves will blow in, rabbit turds blow in, you'll get this  
**[0:19:13-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:19:13):**  little microclimate going on of more hyper fertile soil going on in there, moisture soil  
**[0:19:19-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:19:19):**  going on in there, and things will grow better.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:19:22):**  So we imitate wind by pushing stuff over.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:19:27):**  I regularly go by with my front end loader and trees that are not performing the way  
**[0:19:32-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:19:32):**  I want, let's say hazelnut bushes that aren't producing the quantities of hazelnuts that  
**[0:19:39-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:19:39):**  I want.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:19:40):**  I'll drive by with my front end loader and I just jam into the base of it and it like  
**[0:19:45-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:19:45):**  rips them up out of the ground.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:19:47):**  That's a perfect mimic of wind that knocked this plant over and the roots get torn up  
**[0:19:53-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:19:53):**  out of the ground.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:19:54):**  Yeah, you just get to be more selective with it.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:19:57):**  I can be very precisely selective and that's the beauty of it.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:20:01):**  Then as far as the mimicking, the effects of fire is concerned, I've done some experimenting  
**[0:20:07-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:20:07):**  with burning, but fire, if you can imagine going through a wooded area, often times will  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:20:14):**  destroy the tops of trees.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:20:18):**  Sometimes in a very intense fire, it completely eliminates the top of the tree.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:20:23):**  It's gone.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:20:24):**  That biomass is removed from the site.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:20:26):**  All the nutrients that were in that tree have been oxidized and removed from the site.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:20:30):**  That sounds to me like a harvest.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:20:33):**  If we go in and we harvest all that biomass, we'll take the branches and we'll put them  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:20:38):**  right on the ground for chipping later with a flail chopper that we inoculate with stropheria  
**[0:20:44-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:20:44):**  mushrooms so we'll have edible mushrooms.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:20:47):**  We'll take the wood that's in the middle, the smallest diameter material we'll use for  
**[0:20:51-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:20:51):**  firewood.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:20:52):**  We'll use medium diameter material for mushroom logs.  
**[0:20:57-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:20:57):**  Larger diameter material gets milled into boards.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:20:59):**  I'm actually sitting in a close to 60 by 80 building right now that all the framing and  
**[0:21:07-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:21:07):**  the inside paneling in this is made out of boards milled from trees that I planted.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:21:15):**  So we utilize that biomass, so we'll go through and we'll imitate a fire, for example, and  
**[0:21:20-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:21:20):**  go through and just get rid of all the tops of all that material.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:21:23):**  We get all the organic matter down on the ground where it can start the decomposition  
**[0:21:28-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:21:28):**  cycle.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:21:29):**  We'll put our own preferred varieties of decomposers in there.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:21:32):**  Now it all sounds really cool and complex.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:21:36):**  It's simple, simple, simple.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:21:39):**  And there are people over and over again that keep on wanting me to explain how to do this  
**[0:21:48-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:21:48):**  and make zillions of dollars a minute doing this.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:21:52):**  Well I don't.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:21:55):**  I earn a decent livelihood.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:21:58):**  I've fed my family here, raised kids and they're all off on their own by now.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:22:03):**  I have a modest nest and egg set up and I can pay my bills.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:22:10):**  I haven't really had to buy food in 20 plus years and I eat really, really well.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:22:18):**  The trick is you have to have enough of a quantity to be able to get that product to  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:22:24):**  market and all the processing that I mentioned earlier.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:22:29):**  So there has to be enough of it first and then you also have to know when is enough  
**[0:22:36-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:22:36):**  and what to focus on more or less.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:22:39):**  And instead of getting excited by the sparkling things that are really cool and groovy, go  
**[0:22:43-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:22:43):**  with something that's steady, eddy and reliable and super easy and cheap.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:22:49):**  Because way back before I started this ramble, you remember what I said, that the least expensive  
**[0:22:57-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:22:57):**  way to manage a natural system is the way nature does it.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:23:01):**  You can take a piece of ground, set up a plant community and walk away from it and never  
**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:23:06):**  do anything to it at all.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:23:09):**  Natural forces, I'll put forces in quotes, will take care of that and there will be things  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:23:15):**  in there that will feed you, heat your house, you could build out of it, make mushrooms,  
**[0:23:19-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:23:19):**  and all that kind of stuff, you can sell them.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:23:22):**  So what we do is we try to figure out how little work we can actually do in order to  
**[0:23:32-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:23:32):**  get the yields that we want.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:23:34):**  We don't try to, I'm not trying to beat anybody's yields on anything, I'm interested in spending  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:23:41):**  less money on doing things.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:23:46):**  Why should I gather up all kinds of biomass, which we have plenty of, put it in a special  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:23:51):**  controlled environment to burn it without oxygen, to crush it up to apply it as biochar?  
**[0:23:57-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:23:57):**  Why would I go through all of that work, why would I waste the energy in wood, turning  
**[0:24:03-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:24:03):**  it into heat, when I could take all that energy in wood and turn it into life in the form  
**[0:24:09-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:24:09):**  of mushrooms and soil life and so on and so on.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:24:13):**  Closing the loop on all of your systems so that the waste products of one system get  
**[0:24:18-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:24:18):**  used as the feed products of another.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:24:21):**  If I need to buy a new piece of equipment or hire somebody to do something on the farm,  
**[0:24:25-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:24:25):**  I'm not likely to do it because why bother?  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:24:28):**  Yeah, I mean you have to put it through a certain level of arbitrage to see whether  
**[0:24:32-0:24:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:24:32):**  it's actually necessary for the inputs and the extra effort required I'd imagine.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:24:39):**  And that's actually one of the things that I've been a control site in a number of different  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:24:44):**  experiments that like Department of Natural Resources done with tree establishment and  
**[0:24:49-0:24:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:24:49):**  direct seeding of trees and tree tubes and all these different other things.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:24:52):**  And in a control is you basically do nothing.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:24:55):**  So I'm happy to do nothing, no weed control, no water, no fertilizer, no nothing.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:25:01):**  And we actually get results.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:25:04):**  Do we get the same percentage survival as if you had done all the bells and whistles  
**[0:25:09-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:25:09):**  that you're supposed to?  
**[0:25:11-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:25:11):**  No we don't.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:25:12):**  However because we planted enough we can get a lower rate of survival and we still have  
**[0:25:18-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:25:18):**  stuff and we didn't do anything to it other than keep it alive for the first few months  
**[0:25:25-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:25:25):**  of its life.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:25:26):**  And a great example is with chestnuts.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:25:29):**  Go do a search online for Michigan State University chestnut enterprise budget and you're out  
**[0:25:36-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:25:36):**  close to $150,000 before year seven hits and you have yet to harvest a single chestnut.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:25:44):**  Well starting the very first year while planting chestnuts I'm making money on every acre not  
**[0:25:53-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:25:53):**  from the chestnuts.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:25:54):**  It's from all the other parts of the system.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:25:55):**  So it's all the parts of the system add up together in order to be enough to pay the  
**[0:26:02-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:26:02):**  bills.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:26:03):**  And I wasn't out $180,000 or $150,000 by year seven.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:26:08):**  I'd actually made a little money.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:26:10):**  Yeah and so it's that resilience of having multiple systems working in synchronicity  
**[0:26:15-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:26:15):**  with one another.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:26:17):**  Neither one of them individually is paying the bills but they also aren't you know sort  
**[0:26:23-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:26:23):**  of that linchpin that if it fails everything goes under either.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:26:26):**  Yeah you've said a phrase that there was one time that a journalist intentionally quoted  
**[0:26:34-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:26:34):**  me and clipped the quote and didn't take the whole thing and you know they did it because  
**[0:26:38-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:26:38):**  they wanted to poo poo the kind of stuff that I do.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:26:41):**  I said there's not any one thing that I do on this farm that's profitable by itself and  
**[0:26:47-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:26:47):**  they stopped the quote at there's not anything that I do on this farm that's profitable.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:26:53):**  Yeah that's sneaky.  
**[0:26:54-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:26:54):**  There's no single thing here will take care of it all.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:27:00):**  Likewise there's no single thing if I'm a corn farmer and I got a failure of corn crop  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:27:05):**  I'm out for the year I've got to have you know federal subsidies and crop insurance  
**[0:27:09-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:27:09):**  and all that kind of stuff.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:27:11):**  We didn't raise any livestock this year.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:27:13):**  I got five freezers full of meat.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:27:14):**  What do I need animals for you know.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:27:17):**  I have all that extra effort when I can go you know canoeing in the boundary waters or  
**[0:27:23-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:27:23):**  something.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:27:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:27:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:27:26):**  So hey so I know that in your case as with nearly everybody starting out in agriculture  
**[0:27:30-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:27:30):**  it took many years for your systems and operations to mature and develop.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:27:34):**  So could you tell me about how you planned ahead for this this gradual development and  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:27:38):**  how you manage those progressive stages until you were able to start collecting more of  
**[0:27:43-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:27:43):**  a yield on these perennial systems.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:27:45):**  Right well the.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:27:46):**  You know once again that that answer right there comes from imitating nature and natural  
**[0:27:52-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:27:52):**  plant communities because the the successional pathway how long it takes for a oak savannah  
**[0:27:59-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:27:59):**  to reach a certain phase of maturity is fairly well known in the stages are known what vegetation  
**[0:28:06-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:28:06):**  stages go through on their way to becoming this you know somewhat mature savannah type  
**[0:28:13-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:28:13):**  system.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:28:14):**  And so we were able to have that as some knowledge that we worked with and in the early years  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:28:20):**  what we did is some of the agroforestry techniques we're still doing you know the agroforestry  
**[0:28:25-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:28:25):**  techniques where we would plant a row of trees and then have an alley with a cash crop.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:28:31):**  And in the early years just like in a disturbed system let's go to a landslide or a volcano  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:28:36):**  eruption or or silt deposited from a flood is bare dirt.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:28:42):**  Nature goes through this phase the first phase is typically a lot of the rank annual reads  
**[0:28:47-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:28:47):**  their job weeds their job is to hold down that soil get some carbon in there live for  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:28:53):**  a season put out a prodigious amount of seeds then die and contribute your body to the to  
**[0:28:58-0:29:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:28:58):**  the whole growing soil food web.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:29:01):**  Then over time the perennials come in grasses etc. and eventually as the the shrubs and  
**[0:29:08-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:29:08):**  vines and trees grow and mature you can get away completely from the annuals.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:29:15):**  So once upon a time I was doing maybe 12 to 16 acres of certified organic produce.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:29:24):**  And for for people who who grow produce commercially if if you wake up in the morning and you got  
**[0:29:34-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:29:34):**  work to do out in your produce patch and if the first thing that you grab is a hand tool  
**[0:29:41-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:29:41):**  that's what I call gardening.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:29:42):**  This is not meant to be offensive or anything this is just a it's a it's a radical difference  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:29:48):**  in a set of techniques to grow vegetables.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:29:52):**  Most vegetables that human beings eat in the United States of America are grown on farms  
**[0:29:58-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:29:58):**  are there planted into soil prepared by a machine planted with a machine managed with  
**[0:30:06-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:30:06):**  a machine harvest with a machine of course oftentimes using chemicals.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:30:11):**  Very little hand labor and if you can just imagine the iconic CSA with 120 different  
**[0:30:17-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:30:17):**  varieties of produce 50 volunteers three times a week and all the craziness on harvest days  
**[0:30:24-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:30:24):**  of these crazy diverse boxes if you're going to be doing a wide diversity of produce every  
**[0:30:30-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:30:30):**  time you switch between bundling radishes to bundling Swiss chard to bundling cilantro  
**[0:30:36-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:30:36):**  to you know so on and so on you're losing efficiencies whereas if you still have a certain  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:30:42):**  amount of diversity in your produce like three or four vegetable crops but you grow them  
**[0:30:46-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:30:46):**  at scale.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:30:48):**  When I'm harvesting green peppers I know I get up in the morning I got this size box  
**[0:30:52-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:30:52):**  this size field tote I'm feeling for this size pepper I snap it this way trim the stem  
**[0:30:58-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:30:58):**  put it in the box and I don't look up until I'm done at the end of the day that's very  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:31:04):**  efficient you don't have all those breaks in time you don't have to switch boxes and  
**[0:31:09-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:31:09):**  I sell wholesale I'm not I'm not selling at farmers market no CSA so the price per unit  
**[0:31:20-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:31:20):**  is probably one third of what you would get at farmers market or CSA and a lot of people  
**[0:31:27-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:31:27):**  will come out here and they'll be doing asparagus for example and just flip out that I'm only  
**[0:31:33-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:31:33):**  getting 350 a pound for asparagus that's insane you go down to the you know you go down to  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:31:39):**  farmers market seven bucks a pound for that stuff well okay take your asparagus down to  
**[0:31:44-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:31:44):**  farmers market and sell it for seven bucks a pound maybe sell 15, 20, 30 pounds of asparagus  
**[0:31:51-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:31:51):**  is that a business are you going to be able to pay your bills with that where whereas  
**[0:31:56-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:31:56):**  in my case I got two acres of asparagus the reason why I've got two acres of asparagus  
**[0:32:02-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:32:02):**  is because one human being getting up at five in the morning and and working for about eight  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:32:08):**  hours a day can pick two acres asparagus you pick it you bundle it pack it weigh it put  
**[0:32:13-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:32:13):**  it in boxes put it in the cooler in before two o'clock in the afternoon then you got  
**[0:32:18-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:32:18):**  the rest of day to get something done and back to yields and how this this relates you  
**[0:32:24-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:32:24):**  have to have enough to go wholesale because we're just marginally large enough to really  
**[0:32:31-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:32:31):**  get on a wholesale truck that's where the whole get bigger get out thing the economies  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:32:38):**  of scale is a little bit bizarre and so how we've coped with that is by being part of  
**[0:32:43-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:32:43):**  a cooperative grow remember the organic Valley cooperative on the in the produce program  
**[0:32:51-0:32:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:32:51):**  and say there's a dozen of us growing asparagus I only end up with about a ton of asparagus  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:32:58):**  in the course of one year I challenge you to sell a ton of asparagus at farmers market  
**[0:33:03-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:33:03):**  but a ton of asparagus in the course of a year on two acres it's a quick little six  
**[0:33:09-0:33:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:33:09):**  week season I bring my asparagus put it on the same pallet with all the other growers  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:33:14):**  and then it goes on the trucks you know like half a truckload or a full truckload of produce  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:33:19):**  at a time sure how many really how how many acres do you have again of asparagus no no  
**[0:33:24-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:33:24):**  to two of asparagus but as the whole farm it's a hundred and ten hundred ten okay yeah  
**[0:33:30-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:33:30):**  to give us an idea what relates what relates to the hundred and ten it also relates the  
**[0:33:34-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:33:34):**  asparagus and in earlier comments I made typically I get lower yields across the board of every  
**[0:33:43-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:33:43):**  single thing that I grow I get lower yields of chestnut lower yields of you know hazelnuts  
**[0:33:48-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:33:48):**  lower yields of asparagus lower yields of produce lower yields on on you know amount  
**[0:33:53-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:33:53):**  of beef or pork gain per acre and that's okay I may be getting a lower yield but I get multiple  
**[0:34:00-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:34:00):**  yields per acre and my my costs are virtually you know non-existent they really they really  
**[0:34:09-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:34:09):**  almost disappear yeah that's a big thing that so many of the other regenerative agriculture  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:34:15):**  list that I've interviewed like Joel Salatin and Richard Perkins really harp on is the  
**[0:34:20-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:34:20):**  profit is not always in increasing the yield or upping the scale at which you're producing  
**[0:34:25-0:34:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:34:25):**  things but if you can maximize efficiency and get your overhead down to a minimum that's  
**[0:34:31-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:34:31):**  really where it becomes a sustainable business practice well don't get me going because at  
**[0:34:37-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:34:37):**  least one of the people in the sustainable regenerative movement you know basically lowers  
**[0:34:43-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:34:43):**  his overhead by not paying anybody anything as a matter of fact charges people they have  
**[0:34:48-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:34:48):**  to pay him in order to work for him that seems to me a lot like what I call that slavery  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:34:54):**  anyway you know so that's I'm not going to do that that's I don't think that's right  
**[0:34:59-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:34:59):**  yeah it's also not typical of most people who are running these things there are a couple  
**[0:35:05-0:35:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:35:05):**  of people who've gotten famous off the image in the way that they teach that have access  
**[0:35:09-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:35:09):**  to that type of pedagogy or attraction to the workforce but it's not representative  
**[0:35:15-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:35:15):**  of the larger movement well good I hope not I see it I see it all too often I really do  
**[0:35:23-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:35:23):**  as you know especially in the CSA model it really bums me out because there's a lot of  
**[0:35:29-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:35:29):**  produce being produced out there in the world high quality stuff really good stuff by really  
**[0:35:34-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:35:34):**  excellent expert craftsmen farmers but it's not a profitable business because they have  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:35:39):**  to depend on free labor to harvest it that you know there's there's there's something  
**[0:35:45-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:35:45):**  wrong with our economy I'm not going to necessarily blame them there's something wrong with our  
**[0:35:49-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:35:49):**  economy that we have to have slaves in order for our business to be viable yeah that could  
**[0:35:56-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:35:56):**  be said of a lot of different business models though too right internships think about that  
**[0:36:00-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:36:00):**  you're interned oh my goodness that is one good way to look at it well hey so you're  
**[0:36:07-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:36:07):**  known for giving very honest and practical advice to help people come to terms with the  
**[0:36:11-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:36:11):**  reality of regenerative farming which is exactly what you're talking about right now it's a  
**[0:36:16-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:36:16):**  good transition so I mean it's one of the reasons why I've been such a big fan of your  
**[0:36:20-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:36:20):**  cinema NARS your online videos and of course the book restorative agriculture what are  
**[0:36:26-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:36:26):**  some of the other pivotal concepts other than the ones you just mentioned already that permaculture  
**[0:36:32-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:36:32):**  lists really need to grasp if they want to make a successful enterprise out of farming  
**[0:36:38-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:36:38):**  right just just as a non aside the title of the book is restoration agriculture I intentionally  
**[0:36:44-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:36:44):**  chose that because by by observing nature imitating the natural plant communities we  
**[0:36:49-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:36:49):**  are doing genuine ecological restoration absolutely we're doing it simultaneously with food production  
**[0:36:56-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:36:56):**  which is agriculture and we're using the cash flow from the agriculture to accomplish ecological  
**[0:37:01-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:37:01):**  restoration so it's it's talking to the ecological restoration folks and it's talking to the  
**[0:37:07-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:37:07):**  agricultural folks and one of the things that that absolutely needs to be addressed somebody  
**[0:37:14-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:37:14):**  just sent me an article lately about you know somebody's bashing permaculture because it's  
**[0:37:18-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:37:18):**  just a cult of this and that and the other thing well I he wanted me to rebut the article  
**[0:37:24-0:37:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:37:24):**  everything that was said in that article was true that the biggest thing I think that that  
**[0:37:30-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:37:30):**  permaculturists have to to understand is that if you want this to actually take off and  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:37:39):**  be something more than a really cool fun social movement for people who have extra time in  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:37:44):**  the capital to be able to do this and aren't like hungry and looking for the next you know  
**[0:37:48-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:37:48):**  two liter bottle of soda pop and a bag of Cheetos it has to be an economically viable  
**[0:37:58-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:37:58):**  enterprise part of what that will require is a certain scale well then permies go right  
**[0:38:05-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:38:05):**  to the thing oh but the changes are supposed to be small everything's supposed to be small  
**[0:38:11-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:38:11):**  it's like well use small and incremental changes here's one small incremental change that I  
**[0:38:20-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:38:20):**  would like to implement across the USA let's take all of the annual crop land and do one  
**[0:38:28-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:38:28):**  small change and begin the transition back toward the natural plant community types that  
**[0:38:34-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:38:34):**  it was before European settlers got here that's a small change and yet it covers hundreds  
**[0:38:40-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:38:40):**  of millions of acres square miles of land and it would be ecologically huge so I think  
**[0:38:50-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:38:50):**  that that you know the small incremental changes principle has been misinterpreted to the detriment  
**[0:39:00-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:39:00):**  of permaculture yeah I completely agree with that it's one of the reasons why I really  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:39:06):**  gravitated towards your teachings as well is like you said small and incremental changes  
**[0:39:11-0:39:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:39:11):**  but it needs to be done on a scale where it actually has an impact and no one's going  
**[0:39:15-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:39:15):**  to continue to follow these models if it's not economically viable moving forward and  
**[0:39:20-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:39:20):**  even if it's not and this is actually what's fascinating you know I mentioned my growing  
**[0:39:24-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:39:24):**  up well we were basically suburban homesteaders the homesteader trip what a beautiful lifestyle  
**[0:39:31-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:39:31):**  that is however what an economic piece of crap it is because you got to work all day  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:39:38):**  at your job just in order to have enough money to pay your bills in order to get by well  
**[0:39:43-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:39:43):**  then as soon as you get home you got to go out and you know you know say milk the goats  
**[0:39:48-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:39:48):**  or you know milk the chickens or whoever you're milking and then take care of this produce  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:39:52):**  and that produce and butcher this and process that and yet it's not enough of any of that  
**[0:39:57-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:39:57):**  to make any money at except on Saturday make 30 bucks at farmers market or whatever and  
**[0:40:03-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:40:03):**  most most of the suburban urban homesteader permie types aren't feeding themselves so  
**[0:40:11-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:40:11):**  if you can't feed yourself how are you supposed to have surplus to share with others if it's  
**[0:40:17-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:40:17):**  if it's going to be fair share well then how about having enough to share but this take  
**[0:40:21-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:40:21):**  care of yourself first and can you feed yourself and and one of the things I think that the  
**[0:40:27-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:40:27):**  urban suburban permaculturists should at least look at more closely I'm not trying to like  
**[0:40:34-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:40:34):**  you know do any kind of serious smackdown here show me one example one example of somebody  
**[0:40:42-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:40:42):**  growing all of their food in their yard permaculturally one example grow your food you know how much  
**[0:40:49-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:40:49):**  food 200 just take Paul Wheaton Paul Wheaton is not a small animal he's one no he's not  
**[0:40:57-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:40:57):**  neither in size or in personality he's not exactly skinny either that boy takes a lot  
**[0:41:04-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:41:04):**  of calories a lot of carbohydrates proteins and oils to keep that body going and to feed  
**[0:41:10-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:41:10):**  that thing it's going to take more than a berry bush in your backyard and a mud oven  
**[0:41:16-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:41:16):**  has never fed anybody a mud oven might cook some pizza but it's not feeding anybody so  
**[0:41:21-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:41:21):**  let's get these things to the scale where we're actually solving real problems for real  
**[0:41:28-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:41:28):**  and feeding people and having a surplus to exchange with others however we feel like  
**[0:41:33-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:41:33):**  it if you want to give it away give it away if you want to charge way too much and rip  
**[0:41:37-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:41:37):**  people off do that we want to have surplus produced in ecological systems.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:41:42):**  There you go now that leads me to one of the sticking points that a lot of people who are  
**[0:41:47-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:41:47):**  looking to scale up their enterprises often end up in and I know you've done something  
**[0:41:52-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:41:52):**  that pretty much every permaculture practitioner I know aspires to and that's owning your own  
**[0:41:57-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:41:57):**  land or farm.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:41:59):**  So in your case you're able to do it without any inheritance savings grants or gifts.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:42:04):**  Can you help to explain the systems that you use and that anyone in the U.S. at least can  
**[0:42:08-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:42:08):**  use to acquire their own land.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:42:11):**  Yeah one is it's called borrowing money it's called getting a mortgage.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:42:15):**  And so all of a sudden you bump right into the scale thing right off the bat it's like  
**[0:42:19-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:42:19):**  oh my gosh let's just use here as an example fairly reasonably priced land three thousand  
**[0:42:26-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:42:26):**  dollars an acre a hundred acre farm that's three hundred thousand dollars there's three  
**[0:42:31-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:42:31):**  thousand dollar a month payments.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:42:33):**  Okay how do I earn three thousand dollars a month I need to you know you divide that  
**[0:42:38-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:42:38):**  up however you want to divide that up.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:42:42):**  That's a math problem.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:42:43):**  Well one of the things that you can do is start today.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:42:48):**  I started with haircuts because I had done a brief stint sailing on the oceans in grey  
**[0:42:54-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:42:54):**  boats for the federal government and I had to get a haircut every two weeks and it cost  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:43:00):**  me money out of my paycheck to get my haircut or else I'd fail inspection.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:43:05):**  So what I did as soon as I got out as I said I you know I'm not going to live in an industrial  
**[0:43:10-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:43:10):**  wasteland city anymore I'm going to get a piece of land somewhere out in the country  
**[0:43:16-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:43:16):**  so I have to start saving my money for a down payment.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:43:21):**  And so every time I needed a haircut I took the equivalent amount of money and I put it  
**[0:43:26-0:43:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:43:26):**  in into an investment vehicle that you can do really really small and you can't touch  
**[0:43:33-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:43:33):**  it for five years.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:43:35):**  And it's a pathetic return on investment but that wasn't the point.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:43:39):**  The point was to discipline myself to put money away that I can't touch and those were  
**[0:43:44-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:43:44):**  US savings bonds, double E savings bonds.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:43:47):**  You can put them wherever you want to put in a money market CDs savings account but  
**[0:43:52-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:43:52):**  you've got to have the discipline to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or that  
**[0:43:55-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:43:55):**  money will never pile up.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:43:57):**  Another easy way to do it is to go ahead and not have a double over under frappuccino from  
**[0:44:05-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:44:05):**  buck starts shade grown and all that kind of stuff don't have that.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:44:09):**  Go get a dollar cup of rot gut at the you know Mr. Donut or Horton Tim's or whoever  
**[0:44:18-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:44:18):**  you go to and take that extra two bucks that you would have spent on a fancy drink put  
**[0:44:23-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:44:23):**  it away save it.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:44:25):**  Then after a period of years go by forget how many years it was probably was it was  
**[0:44:31-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:44:31):**  probably four or five years of putting my haircut money away and coffee money away on  
**[0:44:37-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:44:37):**  that had a reasonable amount of money saved up.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:44:40):**  You don't need all the money for to buy a piece of land you just need enough money for  
**[0:44:45-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:44:45):**  the down payment.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:44:47):**  One of the things that I had also done was exercise my credit worthiness by flexing my  
**[0:44:55-0:44:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:44:55):**  credit cards and I got as many credit cards as I possibly could any offer I got in the  
**[0:44:59-0:45:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:44:59):**  mail I said yes and then what I would do is on my day to day spending if I needed to buy  
**[0:45:07-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:45:07):**  a hat I would put it on my credit cards then immediately pay off the credit card bill with  
**[0:45:14-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:45:14):**  money from my checking account and what that did is that you would get that credit being  
**[0:45:20-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:45:20):**  that you borrowed money from your credit card but then you paid it off before it generated  
**[0:45:26-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:45:26):**  interest.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:45:28):**  So by exercising your skill at borrowing and paying it off now don't be buying stupid stuff  
**[0:45:36-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:45:36):**  like flat screen TVs and racking up credit at the bar on Friday nights and all that kind  
**[0:45:41-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:45:41):**  of stuff use it for your day to day expenses and pay it off before it generates interest.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:45:48):**  Then what will happen is you now have saved some money and you now have a proven track  
**[0:45:55-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:45:55):**  record of borrowing then it's quite likely that you can maybe if you can't get it from  
**[0:46:03-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:46:03):**  a bank or credit union you can convince a person who's selling land to sell you the  
**[0:46:10-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:46:10):**  land on what's called a land contract other people call it the seller takes back some  
**[0:46:17-0:46:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:46:17):**  paper which means it's an owner financed deal.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:46:20):**  And so that's how I got started was 100% borrowed money buying a clear cut up in Maine.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:46:29):**  Why would I buy a clear cut?  
**[0:46:30-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:46:30):**  Well because the value add for the improvement is going to be even more so if I'd bought  
**[0:46:36-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:46:36):**  a piece of paradise one I wouldn't be able to afford it and two how much value can you  
**[0:46:41-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:46:41):**  add to it it's already doing really really well but if you got a place that looks like  
**[0:46:46-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:46:46):**  you know somebody dropped bombs on it you can turn that around real quick with a little  
**[0:46:51-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:46:51):**  bit of work and so what you do is you go out there with your you know chainsaw or handsaw  
**[0:46:57-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:46:57):**  whatever it is you make a recreational cabin and have everything permitted and legal according  
**[0:47:03-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:47:03):**  to the local codes don't try to do anything crazy and far out because you're a cool permie  
**[0:47:08-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:47:08):**  and all that stuff what we're doing here is we're trying to earn a livelihood and make  
**[0:47:12-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:47:12):**  a living and not get the law after us.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:47:15):**  So after you build your nice little recreational cabin plant all these trees you know chestnuts  
**[0:47:20-0:47:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:47:20):**  and hazelnuts hickory nuts and butternuts and walnuts and all that stuff then you hire  
**[0:47:25-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:47:25):**  an appraiser to come and look at the land and say hey you put a recreational cabin on  
**[0:47:32-0:47:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:47:32):**  it that land is now worth this much more.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:47:35):**  Well when you get an appraisal from an appraiser you take it to a bank the bank will loan you  
**[0:47:39-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:47:39):**  up to 80% of that appraised value they will they know that if you don't make a payment  
**[0:47:45-0:47:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:47:45):**  they just take the land and it's worth that much and they'll just sell it to somebody  
**[0:47:48-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:47:48):**  else so you use that money that you borrow up to the 80% of the of the property value  
**[0:47:54-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:47:54):**  to buy the next one and so basically I've been a non non selling flipper for the past  
**[0:48:02-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:48:02):**  30 years I've had to flip two properties you know for cash flow purposes but you buy a  
**[0:48:10-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:48:10):**  piece of property you improve on it ecologically using permaculture design principles agro  
**[0:48:15-0:48:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:48:15):**  forestry techniques build a little recreational shelter you know it qualifies as a recreational  
**[0:48:20-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:48:20):**  cabin to me it's a castle and you're you're creating real value we are real estate investors  
**[0:48:28-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:48:28):**  and if you just look around you the degraded land available on this planet is is astronomically  
**[0:48:35-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:48:35):**  huge we can buy garbage cheap junk land that nobody wants ecologically rehabilitate it  
**[0:48:41-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:48:41):**  and we get the added value because we did the work.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:48:45):**  That's right and like you said that inherent value that you add to a space too is finally  
**[0:48:49-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:48:49):**  being valued correctly and I mean aside from all the ecological advice in that that's just  
**[0:48:56-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:48:56):**  good sound financial advice for anyone trying to accrue equity.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:49:02):**  Right and then what was interesting is you noticed that I said that you know you increase  
**[0:49:06-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:49:06):**  the validus property to borrow more money and then buy the next one well that means  
**[0:49:10-0:49:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:49:10):**  the next one's mortgage and then you increase the value of that you pay off the first you  
**[0:49:15-0:49:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:49:15):**  buy the third you pay off the second you buy the fourth and so on and so on you always  
**[0:49:19-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:49:19):**  have this pile of debt and have you ever heard of politicians referring to the phrase to  
**[0:49:26-0:49:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:49:26):**  kick the can down the road?  
**[0:49:28-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:49:28):**  Yep.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:49:29):**  Well that's what we're doing that's called the economy the planetary economy works this  
**[0:49:35-0:49:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:49:35):**  way it just does okay so it's evil big deal are you using it to create earth care people  
**[0:49:41-0:49:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:49:41):**  care and some sort of equitable system for humanity and all the other life that we share  
**[0:49:47-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:49:47):**  on this on this incredible planet are you using the twisted warped economic system that  
**[0:49:54-0:50:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:49:54):**  we have in order to feed yourself your friends your family and to pass down a place that  
**[0:50:01-0:50:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:50:01):**  will benefit the future in perpetuity.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:50:04):**  Now let's think about I've got one property that has a mortgage on it and if I miss too  
**[0:50:10-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:50:10):**  many payments are they're going to take it away well then what happens I go back to the  
**[0:50:17-0:50:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:50:17):**  previous one and what was planted there it's a it's a I hate the phrase food forest but  
**[0:50:23-0:50:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:50:23):**  there's there's a food ecosystem has been planted there and there's a place for me to  
**[0:50:28-0:50:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:50:28):**  live and it's paid for free and clear and it has an account that pays the taxes and  
**[0:50:34-0:50:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:50:34):**  it's all done with borrowing and improving the value of the property and it's a good  
**[0:50:41-0:50:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:50:41):**  way of flipping this on its head because like like you said a lot of people are somewhat  
**[0:50:44-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:50:44):**  allergic to the concept of borrowing especially of getting into debt it seems contrary to  
**[0:50:50-0:50:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:50:50):**  many of the principles that they're trying to promote but from this angle if it's done  
**[0:50:54-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:50:54):**  for the right reasons and if you really have a plan starting out it's one of the most legitimate  
**[0:50:59-0:51:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:50:59):**  ways to really start building towards something larger and making a real impact rather than  
**[0:51:03-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:51:03):**  just fooling around with small gardens.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:51:06):**  And for me what makes a big difference there is that what you're not doing is buying a  
**[0:51:12-0:51:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:51:12):**  cardboard condo in Florida in order to paint it white and then flip it for you know ten  
**[0:51:18-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:51:18):**  thousand dollars more to me there's no real value been added to the human race or to the  
**[0:51:23-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:51:23):**  planet it's just more toxic crap and it's going to blow away in the first hurricane  
**[0:51:27-0:51:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:51:27):**  whereas if I go to a piece of degraded real estate a sand pit a quarry a clear cut you  
**[0:51:32-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:51:32):**  know a mudslide landslide and I rehabilitate that ecologically it's a better home for wildlife  
**[0:51:38-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:51:38):**  is producing air clean air clean water and if I stack it heavily with the food and the  
**[0:51:44-0:51:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:51:44):**  medicine plants and I build a shelter for me to live on a simple little shelter that's  
**[0:51:49-0:51:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:51:49):**  made with renewable materials far too little attention in the whole permaculture world  
**[0:51:54-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:51:54):**  is spent on talking about wood logs cordwood vertical logs horizontal logs.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:52:01):**  I'm so glad you said that.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:52:04):**  And stone.  
**[0:52:05-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:52:05):**  Hello what about stone.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:52:07):**  You know this bill out of stone.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:52:09):**  And that's my whole kick.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:52:10):**  My whole kick is putting permaculture through the lens of the built environment and just  
**[0:52:14-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:52:14):**  how wasteful it is and how that can be turned on its head to actually make regenerative  
**[0:52:19-0:52:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:52:19):**  living environments so I'm really glad you brought that up.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:52:22):**  Yay.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:52:23):**  Excellent.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:52:24):**  Yeah we'll definitely have to brainstorm some ideas for promoting those concepts sometime  
**[0:52:29-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:52:29):**  soon but yeah go on.  
**[0:52:31-0:52:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:52:31):**  Oh you just derailed me it's not a problem.  
**[0:52:34-0:52:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:52:34):**  You'll start me up again.  
**[0:52:35-0:52:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:52:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:36-0:52:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:52:36):**  So anyways if I miss a payment and they take you know and it's stressful.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:52:39):**  So back to the hard work.  
**[0:52:42-0:52:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:52:42):**  It's going to take some work.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:52:43):**  You know you can't just lay around till the crack of noon and get up and dance around  
**[0:52:47-0:52:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:52:47):**  the garden with a purple hanky and say everything's wonderful we're permaculturists.  
**[0:52:51-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:52:51):**  All right.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:52:52):**  Feed yourself.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:52:53):**  Period.  
**[0:52:54-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:52:54):**  And if and this is all the support networks all of the infrastructure that's otherwise  
**[0:52:58-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:52:58):**  your safety net and can you still take care of yourself.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:53:02):**  A lot of people don't meet that criteria.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:53:04):**  This is a challenge to you right now is starting tomorrow eat nothing unless it was grown in  
**[0:53:11-0:53:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:53:11):**  a permaculture system somewhere.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:53:13):**  OK.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:53:14):**  And keep doing that day after day after day until you cry uncle and come visit me.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:53:22):**  And one of the things about the systems that I've just explained if we're going to imitate  
**[0:53:25-0:53:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:53:25):**  a natural ecosystem what happens if the dinosaur juice doesn't flow anymore the electric robot  
**[0:53:33-0:53:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:53:33):**  cars don't work anymore or you know whatever happens in the zombies start coming.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:53:39):**  Nature is going to still work and if we've set up a natural system we can interact with  
**[0:53:44-0:53:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:53:44):**  that with no more technology more advanced than a stick and a stone.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:53:51):**  Absolutely yeah that's that's one of the things I harp on to people who are total survivalists  
**[0:53:55-0:54:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:53:55):**  and emergency responders and they're hoarding you know cheap canned goods and stuff and  
**[0:54:00-0:54:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:54:00):**  like that's not a real solution.  
**[0:54:03-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:54:03):**  You still at some point need to produce the things that you're going to want to consume  
**[0:54:08-0:54:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:54:08):**  and yeah everything you're talking about is the only viable way to put that to scale.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:54:14):**  The last the last survivalist expo I went to I couldn't believe it.  
**[0:54:18-0:54:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:54:18):**  There were people all over this one booth.  
**[0:54:20-0:54:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:54:20):**  It's a shipping container and it's full of a 20 years supply of 12 ounce aluminum cans  
**[0:54:27-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:54:27):**  of sterilized water.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:54:29):**  And you just go up to it take out your can and it'll keep feeding you cans for 20 years.  
**[0:54:36-0:54:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:54:36):**  It's like what the heck.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:54:38):**  And people are spending big bucks on this it's like ah.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:54:42):**  There's so many better ways.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:54:45):**  And yet and yet they will they won't think about planting a diverse food producing ecosystem  
**[0:54:52-0:54:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:54:52):**  and it won't think about managing it with animals such as like a couple of cows.  
**[0:54:57-0:54:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:54:57):**  No clearly that's insane.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:54:59):**  Yeah totally.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:55:00):**  But canning your water for the next two decades.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:55:02):**  That's a viable option.  
**[0:55:04-0:55:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:55:04):**  There we go.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:55:07):**  Fantastic well OK so let's let's move on just for a second here.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:55:11):**  With so many diverse enterprises going on all at once on your farm how do you keep everything  
**[0:55:16-0:55:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:55:16):**  organized and how do you ensure that any given effort is pulling its own weight in the system.  
**[0:55:21-0:55:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:55:21):**  Because like you mentioned before when it comes to bringing in more machinery or hiring  
**[0:55:25-0:55:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:55:25):**  more people to do things you just don't bother it's not worth the effort for you.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:55:29):**  So how do you sort of make those decisions and cut elements of the system that aren't  
**[0:55:34-0:55:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:55:34):**  pulling their own weight.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:55:36):**  Because if it's not pulling its own weight you know you know it because it's it's dragging  
**[0:55:40-0:55:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:55:40):**  you down you're working your ass off it's no fun and it's not paying any money you know  
**[0:55:44-0:55:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:55:44):**  to get by.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:55:46):**  One of the things that is interesting with all the different things that I've done through  
**[0:55:50-0:55:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:55:50):**  the years and it's different almost every single year there have been people who've  
**[0:55:54-0:55:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:55:54):**  gotten upset.  
**[0:55:55-0:55:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:55:55):**  It's like but you told me you did this.  
**[0:55:56-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:55:56):**  It's like well yeah I did do that for a while until something else was doing better at that  
**[0:56:01-0:56:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:56:01):**  time.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:56:02):**  So one of the things is how many how many balls can you keep in the air while juggling  
**[0:56:07-0:56:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:56:07):**  right.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:56:08):**  What I've kind of noticed is I can basically handle about five above ground plant crop  
**[0:56:15-0:56:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:56:15):**  kind of things and still do a decent job at it.  
**[0:56:19-0:56:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:56:19):**  And I can handle two maybe three types of livestock at any point in time without going  
**[0:56:25-0:56:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:56:25):**  too crazy.  
**[0:56:27-0:56:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:56:27):**  And another thing that we have to understand is it's no crime to fail at something.  
**[0:56:35-0:56:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:56:35):**  So I'm going to do this and you get started and you go at it and you realize after you  
**[0:56:41-0:56:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:56:41):**  know six months a year two years whatever is like wow this ain't working.  
**[0:56:45-0:56:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:56:45):**  Drop it like a stone.  
**[0:56:47-0:56:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:56:47):**  Forget it.  
**[0:56:48-0:56:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:56:48):**  It's like well yeah but all the stuff I got invested in it.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:56:50):**  Well yup you had invested into it and all that time you put into it move on to something  
**[0:56:54-0:56:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:56:54):**  that works.  
**[0:56:55-0:56:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:56:55):**  Let it go.  
**[0:56:56-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:56:56):**  Cut the losses.  
**[0:56:57-0:57:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:56:57):**  Unless you're unless you're trying stuff nothing's going to happen.  
**[0:57:02-0:57:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:57:02):**  And if you try stuff and it doesn't work well stop doing it.  
**[0:57:06-0:57:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:57:06):**  I don't know if that makes any sense at all.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:57:09):**  It does.  
**[0:57:10-0:57:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:57:10):**  Yeah I mean I often get very sentimental when I've put a lot of effort into something and  
**[0:57:14-0:57:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:57:14):**  I don't want to see it fail or at least want to see it through to the bitter end.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:57:19):**  But I have also learned that there does come a point where you do need to cut your losses  
**[0:57:22-0:57:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:57:22):**  and focus on the things that are working.  
**[0:57:25-0:57:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:57:25):**  So I'm actually working with a client right now and I hope he's not listening to this  
**[0:57:29-0:57:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:57:29):**  because I'm not talking about him.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:57:31):**  There's this theoretical person who is running these fancy dancy cattle that they spent big  
**[0:57:41-0:57:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:57:41):**  bucks for because it's the best genetics.  
**[0:57:43-0:57:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:57:43):**  They gain the best on grass and yada yada yada.  
**[0:57:47-0:57:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:57:47):**  And you've got to keep them through the winter so they're in a place that has winter so they  
**[0:57:51-0:57:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:57:51):**  have to cut hay in the summer.  
**[0:57:53-0:57:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:57:53):**  Well if you're cutting hay in the summertime and it rains on the hay it's now poor quality  
**[0:57:57-0:57:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:57:57):**  hay.  
**[0:57:58-0:58:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:57:58):**  So he's got expensive genetics and then through the wintertime he's feeding them cheap garbage  
**[0:58:03-0:58:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:58:03):**  hay because his hay got rained on.  
**[0:58:05-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:58:05):**  Look at all the work that got embedded into that system and all of the losses that he  
**[0:58:11-0:58:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:58:11):**  wired into that system.  
**[0:58:14-0:58:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:58:14):**  First of all he spent 15 grand on one animal for these hyper genetics which is supposedly  
**[0:58:21-0:58:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:58:21):**  the best genetics on grass.  
**[0:58:23-0:58:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:58:23):**  Then he's got to have all the haying equipment that he possibly needs and just look at how  
**[0:58:27-0:58:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:58:27):**  expensive tractor, hay bind, rakes, balers, now a place to store all the hay so now you've  
**[0:58:35-0:58:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:58:35):**  got to have some kind of dry sheds and barns and yada yada yada.  
**[0:58:39-0:58:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:58:39):**  And then of course you're feeding your animals garbage hay because it got rained on.  
**[0:58:44-0:58:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:58:44):**  Well if you all of a sudden said alright I'm not going to do that what I'm going to do  
**[0:58:48-0:58:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:58:48):**  is I'm going to go buy cheap stocker cattle, a one year old calf, a 500 pound animal in  
**[0:58:56-0:58:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:58:56):**  the spring when the grass is green.  
**[0:58:59-0:59:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:58:59):**  Around here they're around a buck, buck fifty a pound usually it varies so let's say it's  
**[0:59:02-0:59:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:59:02):**  a dollar a pound because I could do that math.  
**[0:59:04-0:59:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:59:04):**  It costs you 500 bucks for that animal.  
**[0:59:07-0:59:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:59:07):**  You just run it around on portable electric fence so you've got some, I got to hang on  
**[0:59:13-0:59:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:59:13):**  a second, that's an important call.  
**[0:59:17-0:59:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:59:17):**  Sounded like it.  
**[0:59:18-0:59:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:59:18):**  It's not like something from one of those Ten Commandments movies.  
**[0:59:22-0:59:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:59:22):**  It's the Huntsman or whatever it is.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:59:27):**  So all of a sudden if you just buy that stocker cattle in the spring, you've got your portable  
**[0:59:30-0:59:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:59:30):**  electric fence into it, well then you just eat grass and a cow will gain two to three  
**[0:59:37-0:59:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:59:37):**  pounds a day.  
**[0:59:39-0:59:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:59:39):**  Any old shit, that could be a dairy animal okay, it's going to gain two to three pounds  
**[0:59:43-0:59:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:59:43):**  a day.  
**[0:59:44-0:59:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:59:44):**  Then you sell it in the fall after it's gained 300 pounds in the course of the summertime.  
**[0:59:49-0:59:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:59:49):**  If you paid 500 bucks for it, you sell it same buck a pound in the fall, you sell it  
**[0:59:54-1:00:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=0:59:54):**  for $800, you've just made 60% return on your investment but since it was only six months  
**[1:00:02-1:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:00:02):**  that means it was actually 120% return on your investment.  
**[1:00:05-1:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:00:05):**  What's wrong with that?  
**[1:00:07-1:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:00:07):**  You had all this, oh there's no hay, you don't have to cut hay.  
**[1:00:10-1:00:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:00:10):**  If you need hay, you buy hay, that's a cost but you're buying the top quality, the best  
**[1:00:15-1:00:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:00:15):**  feed that somebody else cut somewhere else and they had all the investments involved  
**[1:00:19-1:00:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:00:19):**  in it.  
**[1:00:20-1:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:00:20):**  Then over the wintertime, you're not trying to keep waterers from breaking, you're not  
**[1:00:23-1:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:00:23):**  trying to get the hay out there through the snow, you don't have to have any kind of shelter  
**[1:00:28-1:00:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:00:28):**  for the animals because they're just out there in the summertime.  
**[1:00:32-1:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:00:32):**  They're not the highfalutin fancy dancy genetics.  
**[1:00:34-1:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:00:34):**  Well alright, that was just a simple buy it at the sale bar and sell it at the sale bar.  
**[1:00:39-1:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:00:39):**  Let's just buy 10 animals, so instead of 500 bucks it's now $5000 and then let's sell them  
**[1:00:47-1:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:00:47):**  to friends at $3 a pound.  
**[1:00:50-1:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:00:50):**  Could you imagine having beef that was grazed on a certified organic farm and you can get  
**[1:00:56-1:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:00:56):**  this animal for only 3 bucks a pound?  
**[1:00:59-1:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:00:59):**  So now if I sell this 800 pound animal in the fall at 3 bucks a pound, that's $2400,  
**[1:01:04-1:01:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:01:04):**  I only got 500 bucks into each animal in the course of the summer, that's in the thousands  
**[1:01:09-1:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:01:09):**  of percent return on your investment.  
**[1:01:11-1:01:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:01:11):**  Why do I need all of that infrastructure investment?  
**[1:01:15-1:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:01:15):**  Yeah, and it's keys like this that really get people rolling so that they can do either  
**[1:01:20-1:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:01:20):**  other enterprises in the future, but at least have enough to securely pay their bills and  
**[1:01:26-1:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:01:26):**  make sure that they have a bit of a safety net while they try other enterprises that  
**[1:01:30-1:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:01:30):**  maybe take a little bit longer to mature or to turn over.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:01:34):**  Let's take the cows for example too.  
**[1:01:37-1:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:01:37):**  Let's get 5 animals and if I'm making a 120% return on my investment, what if I put one  
**[1:01:45-1:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:01:45):**  of them in the freezer, that's 20% of my profits.  
**[1:01:47-1:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:01:47):**  Oh no, now I'm only making 100% return on my investment, crap.  
**[1:01:51-1:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:01:51):**  And I get free beef which if you go to the local food co-op, you're paying sometimes  
**[1:01:57-1:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:01:57):**  like 18 to 24 bucks a pound for ribeyes and t-bones, 6 bucks, 7 bucks a pound just for  
**[1:02:04-1:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:02:04):**  ground beef.  
**[1:02:06-1:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:02:06):**  And so the use value that you're getting out of that and if you don't eat animals, well  
**[1:02:11-1:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:02:11):**  fine.  
**[1:02:13-1:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:02:13):**  Don't eat animals, eat chestnuts and hazelnuts.  
**[1:02:16-1:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:02:16):**  How many pounds of chestnuts and hazelnuts is Paul Wheaton going to eat in the course  
**[1:02:20-1:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:02:20):**  of a year?  
**[1:02:22-1:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:02:22):**  Probably 600 to 1,000 pounds in the course of a year, that's a lot of trees and that's  
**[1:02:29-1:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:02:29):**  a lot of work to pick up those nuts and a lot of work to process those nuts and clean  
**[1:02:34-1:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:02:34):**  those nuts, but it's enough, it'll feed you.  
**[1:02:37-1:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:02:37):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[1:02:39-1:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:02:39):**  Now let's flip that around and talk about some of the various enterprises over the years  
**[1:02:43-1:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:02:43):**  that you have found worth your while because you have a large variety of connected enterprises  
**[1:02:49-1:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:02:49):**  within your farm and counting your expertise as well.  
**[1:02:53-1:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:02:53):**  You give seminars, you sell nursery stock, animals, educational courses.  
**[1:02:57-1:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:02:57):**  How did you eventually decide which of these to put your time and efforts into and what  
**[1:03:02-1:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:03:02):**  are some of the examples of things that didn't quite make the cut?  
**[1:03:07-1:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:03:07):**  Well geesh, we started with the farm.  
**[1:03:12-1:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:03:12):**  The farm is not the real estate.  
**[1:03:14-1:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:03:14):**  The real estate is a real estate investment that's held differently.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:03:17):**  The farm is an LLC.  
**[1:03:19-1:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:03:19):**  It grows agricultural products for sale and so it started with certified organic produce,  
**[1:03:29-1:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:03:29):**  cattle and pigs.  
**[1:03:32-1:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:03:32):**  And the pigs, they don't make as much money I think mostly because the feeder pigs cost  
**[1:03:41-1:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:03:41):**  more relatively speaking than like stocker cattle do.  
**[1:03:47-1:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:03:47):**  And so that's how I started with the produce side of things.  
**[1:03:49-1:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:03:49):**  Well now I wanted to plant all these trees and I realized in a hurry that if I ordered  
**[1:03:57-1:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:03:57):**  a thousand trees I got a per tree cost that was a lot less than if I had bought the hundred  
**[1:04:04-1:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:04:04):**  trees that I really needed.  
**[1:04:06-1:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:04:06):**  So I go buy the thousand trees and sell the other 900 at a modest profit just to cover  
**[1:04:13-1:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:04:13):**  my expenses.  
**[1:04:14-1:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:04:14):**  So then the tree and shrub nursery started working well in real short order because I've  
**[1:04:19-1:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:04:19):**  started from the get-go genetically selecting for fast to reproduce woody plant genetics.  
**[1:04:29-1:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:04:29):**  I had my own seed and I'll think about the tree and shrub nursery industry.  
**[1:04:35-1:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:04:35):**  Do I have to have all these pots and irrigation systems?  
**[1:04:38-1:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:04:38):**  It's like no you don't.  
**[1:04:40-1:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:04:40):**  You just need a little patch of ground, you scratch it up, you protect it from rodents  
**[1:04:45-1:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:04:45):**  and you put in a gazillion seeds.  
**[1:04:48-1:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:04:48):**  And not all of them will sprout.  
**[1:04:50-1:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:04:50):**  Not all of them will be high quality nursery stock.  
**[1:04:53-1:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:04:53):**  So high quality nursery stock you can you know gray it out and you sell that and then  
**[1:04:57-1:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:04:57):**  you have all of this other nursery stock that's been subsidized by sales of stuff that was  
**[1:05:02-1:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:05:02):**  grown from your own seed.  
**[1:05:04-1:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:05:04):**  And so that's worked really well throughout the years.  
**[1:05:08-1:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:05:08):**  A lot of people you know look around now and they say oh yeah you're doing all the speaking  
**[1:05:12-1:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:05:12):**  and teaching and seminars and books and well that's a recent phenomenon.  
**[1:05:17-1:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:05:17):**  I've been at this for 30 years okay and I've only been really out there since 2013 and  
**[1:05:25-1:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:05:25):**  because I'm semi-retired now.  
**[1:05:27-1:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:05:27):**  I've done this for a career.  
**[1:05:30-1:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:05:30):**  And so that's something that has been recent and what it supplanted is in our processing  
**[1:05:37-1:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:05:37):**  building started setting up the hazelnut processing equipment because the hazelnuts need to be  
**[1:05:42-1:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:05:42):**  rubbed out of the husk.  
**[1:05:43-1:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:05:43):**  They need to be cracked, they need to be sorted and separated, pressed for oil.  
**[1:05:48-1:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:05:48):**  So as I was piecing together the processing line for hazelnuts I was also piecing together  
**[1:05:53-1:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:05:53):**  all of the equipment for producing apple cider because we got a couple thousand apple trees  
**[1:06:00-1:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:06:00):**  out there.  
**[1:06:02-1:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:06:02):**  And we licensed as a winery I think it's 10 years now, 10 years ago that we had licensed  
**[1:06:07-1:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:06:07):**  and started making hard cider just prior to the big cider boom.  
**[1:06:17-1:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:06:17):**  And it was going okay.  
**[1:06:20-1:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:06:20):**  It was a heck of a lot of work, a lot of investment in equipment that doesn't have secondary uses.  
**[1:06:27-1:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:06:27):**  Basically an alcohol fermenter or a carbonation tank can only be an alcohol fermenter or a  
**[1:06:32-1:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:06:32):**  carbonation tank and so it was a struggle getting it going.  
**[1:06:38-1:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:06:38):**  Well then we had a new political regime take over and then they campaigned on the promise  
**[1:06:45-1:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:06:45):**  of eliminating stupid regulations so business could flourish, leveling the playing field  
**[1:06:51-1:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:06:51):**  and so what they did is they leveled the playing field and mandated that small scale breweries  
**[1:07:00-1:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:07:00):**  and wineries had to go through a distributor.  
**[1:07:03-1:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:07:03):**  And so what that did is that all of a sudden made the economics suck really bad for doing  
**[1:07:11-1:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:07:11):**  the cider at our scale.  
**[1:07:13-1:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:07:13):**  We could have upscaled and started a factory and kept going.  
**[1:07:17-1:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:07:17):**  Sales were alright, it would have been okay.  
**[1:07:19-1:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:07:19):**  Not the best business manager in the world but it was getting by and our label was getting  
**[1:07:24-1:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:07:24):**  out there and it was right at the cider boom.  
**[1:07:28-1:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:07:28):**  So if we had decided to go ahead and build a factory instead of just having run it out  
**[1:07:33-1:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:07:33):**  of the shop, that would have been a different course we were on.  
**[1:07:39-1:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:07:39):**  So that was a little bit of overwork, underpaid, regulations change and it's like forget it,  
**[1:07:45-1:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:07:45):**  just walk away, just walk away.  
**[1:07:47-1:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:07:47):**  If we were in New York, California or Michigan, we'd be having one heck of a cider house going  
**[1:07:54-1:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:07:54):**  on here because those laws are really favorable to small scale fermentaries.  
**[1:08:00-1:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:08:00):**  And you think about what they shut down during the depression is they wanted to shut down  
**[1:08:06-1:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:08:06):**  the local rural population, they want to be impoverished so they come to town, you work  
**[1:08:11-1:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:08:11):**  in the factories, you make a lot of money off the backs of these people hard working  
**[1:08:15-1:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:08:15):**  and live autonomous, economically independent lives and they won't be dependent on all of  
**[1:08:19-1:08:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:08:19):**  your different systems.  
**[1:08:22-1:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:08:22):**  So that's one that I dropped.  
**[1:08:27-1:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:08:27):**  Right now that's the only one because I'm sitting in my cidery looking at bottles and  
**[1:08:31-1:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:08:31):**  labels and all the knick knacks on the wall.  
**[1:08:35-1:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:08:35):**  A nice little kegerator.  
**[1:08:36-1:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:08:36):**  All the surplus merchandise, yeah.  
**[1:08:38-1:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:08:38):**  Yeah, surplus merchandise.  
**[1:08:40-1:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:08:40):**  Unfortunately there's hundreds of gallons of cider sitting around, ice cold and ready  
**[1:08:44-1:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:08:44):**  to go.  
**[1:08:47-1:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:08:47):**  What a shame to have a surplus of that.  
**[1:08:49-1:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:08:49):**  Terrible.  
**[1:08:50-1:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:08:50):**  Terrible.  
**[1:08:51-1:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:08:51):**  Well, hey Mark, you've been really generous with your time so far, but before I let you  
**[1:08:55-1:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:08:55):**  go, how can listeners get involved with Restoration Agriculture and find out more about your work?  
**[1:09:01-1:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:09:01):**  Well, like I mentioned, you can read the book Restoration Agriculture.  
**[1:09:07-1:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:09:07):**  It's published by Acres USA.  
**[1:09:08-1:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:09:08):**  It's available in Kindle format or regular paperback.  
**[1:09:13-1:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:09:13):**  Yeah, I highly recommend that as well.  
**[1:09:15-1:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:09:15):**  One of my favorites.  
**[1:09:18-1:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:09:18):**  In the Edible Woody Tree Crops nursery, what we are is we're a networked nursery.  
**[1:09:26-1:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:09:26):**  We work with other growers who are doing the breeding work like we are doing it.  
**[1:09:33-1:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:09:33):**  So we specialize in crops that are hyper precocious, meaning they're early to produce, early in  
**[1:09:41-1:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:09:41):**  their life.  
**[1:09:42-1:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:09:42):**  They're pest and disease free with sheer total utter neglect with no fertilizers, herbicides,  
**[1:09:48-1:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:09:48):**  fungicides, etc.  
**[1:09:51-1:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:09:51):**  They're designed, we're genetically selecting on purpose for low input systems.  
**[1:09:57-1:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:09:57):**  So that's forestag.com.  
**[1:10:00-1:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:10:00):**  And then for workshops and or consultation, do a lot of water management systems, aquaculture  
**[1:10:13-1:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:10:13):**  systems, go to restorationag.com.  
**[1:10:17-1:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:10:17):**  Then for regular ongoing training, matter of fact, tonight, this is Wednesday night,  
**[1:10:25-1:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:10:25):**  there will be a session, I'll be doing a session at 6.30 p.m. central.  
**[1:10:30-1:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:10:30):**  We have what we call the Eat Community.  
**[1:10:32-1:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:10:32):**  It's eatcommunity.com.  
**[1:10:35-1:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:10:35):**  And I think we have 12, 13 regular teachers every single week and then we bring on guest  
**[1:10:41-1:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:10:41):**  teachers periodically.  
**[1:10:42-1:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:10:42):**  I do a continuous thread on terrestrial ecology and how it applies to restoration agriculture,  
**[1:10:49-1:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:10:49):**  growing agricultural products in restored ecological systems and all the basic ecology  
**[1:10:56-1:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:10:56):**  that goes with that.  
**[1:10:57-1:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:10:57):**  So there's restorationag.com, forestag.com, eatcommunity.com and AcresUSA for the book  
**[1:11:05-1:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:11:05):**  Restoration Agriculture.  
**[1:11:06-1:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:11:06):**  And I do have a water management systems book due to be published spring or summer of 2018.  
**[1:11:15-1:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:11:15):**  Don't exactly know when that will be out.  
**[1:11:16-1:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:11:16):**  That will also be by AcresUSA.  
**[1:11:19-1:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:11:19):**  So keep an eye out on Acres.  
**[1:11:20-1:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:11:20):**  Fantastic.  
**[1:11:21-1:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:11:21):**  I'm definitely going to look forward to that.  
**[1:11:23-1:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:11:23):**  We'll have to do a follow up interview when that book comes out as well.  
**[1:11:26-1:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:11:26):**  That'll be good.  
**[1:11:28-1:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:11:28):**  And yeah, I really recommend for people to get in touch with the Eat Community.  
**[1:11:31-1:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:11:31):**  I've interviewed some of their other instructors, including William Horvath as well, who I'm  
**[1:11:36-1:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:11:36):**  sure would say hi to if he was here with me today.  
**[1:11:39-1:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:11:39):**  He talks about you all the time.  
**[1:11:40-1:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:11:40):**  Fantastic.  
**[1:11:41-1:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:11:41):**  Well, I really appreciate you taking the time today, Mark.  
**[1:11:43-1:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:11:43):**  It's been a pleasure talking to you and hopefully we'll stay in touch.  
**[1:11:47-1:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:11:47):**  And I'm looking forward to your book coming out later in the year.  
**[1:11:50-1:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:11:50):**  All right.  
**[1:11:51-1:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:11:51):**  Thanks for your time, Oliver.  
**[1:11:52-1:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-shepard/#t=1:11:52):**  Thank you.

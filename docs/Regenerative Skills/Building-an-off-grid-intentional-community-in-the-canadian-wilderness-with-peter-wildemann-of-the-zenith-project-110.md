**[0:01:45-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:01:45):**  Continuing now with this month's focus on regenerative community models, I had the pleasure  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:01:48):**  of interviewing Peter Wildman, co-founder of the Zenith Project, an ecovillage slash  
**[0:01:53-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:01:53):**  intentional community in the Canadian wilderness.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:01:56):**  Peter is passionate about supporting people to live their highest purpose in the context  
**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:02:00):**  of a mutually supportive community by creating a new economic paradigm.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:02:05):**  Peter also aims to focus on connecting people in a small community setting where the most  
**[0:02:09-0:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:02:09):**  authentic relationships can be developed.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:02:11):**  In this interview, we talk about what makes a mutually supportive intentional community,  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:02:15):**  how freedom is not the same as ability, and what it means to rewild yourself, how healthy  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:02:20):**  communities can promote the discovery of your highest potential, and so much more.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:02:25):**  Peter also gives advice on how you can take steps to create your own intentional community  
**[0:02:29-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:02:29):**  and the challenges and hurdles that he's faced along the way.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:02:32):**  Since there are so many different configurations of communities and ecovillages around the  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:02:36):**  world, I would love to hear from anyone listening to this episode who lives in a community configuration  
**[0:02:40-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:02:40):**  like this or who has lived in one in the past.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:02:43):**  Now that I'm essentially a free agent looking to find my home in a healthy community somewhere  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:02:47):**  in the world, I'm fascinated by what elements are essential for healthy community creation  
**[0:02:52-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:02:52):**  and growth, so please reach out to me directly in the comments below or at info at abundantedge.com.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:02:58):**  Now I'll turn things over to Peter.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:03:00):**  Hey Peter, thank you so much for taking the time to be with us here today.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:03:04):**  How are you doing and where are you?  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:03:05):**  Hey Oliver, yeah, good to be here with you.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:03:09):**  I am in the mountains in British Columbia, Canada, about two hours north of Whistler  
**[0:03:16-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:03:16):**  and it's a bit of a cloud forecast day today here, but I can see I'm overlooking the beautiful  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:03:23):**  lake looking at mountains a couple thousand meters tall and we're right in the middle  
**[0:03:28-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:03:28):**  of the wilderness.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:03:29):**  Man, that's an incredible vantage point to be calling in from.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:03:33):**  I really want to come up and visit that area again sometime.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:03:37):**  I've only made it up as far as Whistler, but hey, before we get too far into this, what  
**[0:03:42-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:03:42):**  do you say we just jump into the questions because I have a lot to ask you about your  
**[0:03:46-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:03:46):**  personal projects and communal living in general.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:03:49):**  Yeah, that sounds great.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:03:51):**  All right, so could you start us off by telling us a little bit about your personal background?  
**[0:03:55-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:03:55):**  How did you find your way into this style of living and the educational principles that  
**[0:04:00-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:04:00):**  you promote?  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:04:01):**  Well, to be honest with you, I didn't start out this way.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:04:06):**  I started very much being raised on the conventional program of success in life means going to  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:04:14):**  school, getting good marks and getting into a good university and getting a good corporate  
**[0:04:19-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:04:19):**  job and then getting promoted and getting married, having a mortgage and 2.3 children  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:04:26):**  and that story, that was the context I was raised in and the story I was raised in.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:04:32):**  I always felt like there was more to life than that, that this wasn't it.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:04:38):**  That was the program my parents followed and they weren't as happy as I wanted to be in  
**[0:04:43-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:04:43):**  my own life.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:04:45):**  And so I took what I thought was a different to rebellious path back then and decided I'm  
**[0:04:52-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:04:52):**  going to become an entrepreneur.  
**[0:04:54-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:04:54):**  And while that worked out for me from a financial perspective, my friends and family around  
**[0:05:02-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:05:02):**  me said, look to me as a success because I had a successful business and I was making  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:05:09):**  money and that kind of thing deep, deep down within me, I just wasn't fulfilled.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:05:14):**  I wasn't happy.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:05:18):**  The promise of financial success leading to deep and long-term happiness was empty for  
**[0:05:26-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:05:26):**  me and so I started looking at other things and looking at people who really were happy  
**[0:05:30-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:05:30):**  and seeing what their life looked like and ultimately that long up and hold led me to  
**[0:05:38-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:05:38):**  intentional community.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:05:40):**  In your opinion, what does community or intentional community mean?  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:05:44):**  Because there are so many definitions floating out there and I would love to hear from your  
**[0:05:49-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:05:49):**  perspective how that has manifested in your life.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:05:51):**  Yeah, great question because I think intentional community is maybe on the verge of being almost  
**[0:05:57-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:05:57):**  an overused acronym or word at this point, but what it means for us is that we view intentionally  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:06:05):**  and we take intention in how we do things and how we look at things in the culture that  
**[0:06:09-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:06:09):**  were created and so we enjoy being intentional and not just doing something the way that  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:06:17):**  is done in default society because that's the way everyone else does, that's the way  
**[0:06:21-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:06:21):**  it is.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:06:22):**  So we enjoy and see that as the process of examining and being clear about why we're  
**[0:06:32-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:06:32):**  doing things, not just because that's the way it is.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:06:34):**  All right, so let's talk specifically about the Zenith project.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:06:39):**  What makes it a mutually supportive intentional community?  
**[0:06:42-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:06:42):**  I know that's a lot to unpack there.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:06:45):**  What is a new world of what is possible when we drop the assumptions of the default society  
**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:06:50):**  that you were just talking about?  
**[0:06:52-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:06:52):**  Well, what's possible is that it allows us to really and truly see each other and nature  
**[0:07:00-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:07:00):**  and the planet around us.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:07:03):**  When we don't have a default assumption about how we're supposed to relate to each other  
**[0:07:08-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:07:08):**  or the planet, I think what naturally comes up in people is a real natural curiosity and  
**[0:07:16-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:07:16):**  a desire.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:07:17):**  I think our innate human desires are really to help and to support each other.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:07:21):**  Our highest callings and purposes are not to be competitive and to make money and try  
**[0:07:26-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:07:26):**  and be the most successful we can, but success is often determined by the quality of our  
**[0:07:33-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:07:33):**  relationships and how much we can help each other.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:07:36):**  That's where the joy comes from for most people once they're able to drop expectations and  
**[0:07:44-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:07:44):**  assumptions of the default society.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:07:46):**  That's what we've noticed.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:07:47):**  Going back to what makes it a mutually supportive intentional community, what are the support  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:07:54):**  systems that are put in place that help people to thrive and reach their full potential?  
**[0:07:59-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:07:59):**  Yeah, so that's a great question.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:08:02):**  I think one of the big underlying problems with the default society is this notion that  
**[0:08:12-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:08:12):**  to have access to a place to have a home, to be able to grow your own food, the way  
**[0:08:20-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:08:20):**  that that's set up in society right now is you have to pay for that privilege, whether  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:08:24):**  it's buying land, whether it's a mortgage, whether it's rent.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:08:28):**  Humans are the only animals in the entire world that has to do that.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:08:32):**  Any other animal just says, I'm going to live here.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:08:34):**  I'm going to build my burrow or my nest or my den here.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:08:40):**  This is where I'm going to live and they just do it.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:08:41):**  They don't have to pay for that privilege.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:08:45):**  Where everything starts from with us is we set things up so that people that join or  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:08:54):**  are part of this project, they don't pay for the right to exist here.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:08:59):**  They don't pay for a rent or that kind of thing.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:09:03):**  So the first step in freedom and enabling people and being mutually supportive is helping  
**[0:09:09-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:09:09):**  free people of this main constriction or issue, which is what requires us to not have time  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:09:20):**  to be mutually supportive and focus on ourselves and gets us caught up in jobs and other things  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:09:26):**  that we don't love doing.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:09:28):**  And when we free that up, when we create that context, now we have time and energy.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:09:36):**  And what we're naturally called to do, we find, is we want to help and support each  
**[0:09:40-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:09:40):**  other.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:09:41):**  That's where our happiness comes from, is helping make each other's lives better.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:09:45):**  So I certainly see the criticism of having to pay into a system just to merely live and  
**[0:09:52-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:09:52):**  exist.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:09:53):**  But certainly some of the benefits that have come out of that are increased infrastructure,  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:09:58):**  stability and quality of housing, and many other things that require maintenance are  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:10:03):**  the lifestyles that many of us have come to rely on.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:10:07):**  So without that type of monetary investment expected from the community members, how do  
**[0:10:13-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:10:13):**  you continue to grow, develop, and improve the quality of life for everyone involved?  
**[0:10:19-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:10:19):**  And that's a great question.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:10:20):**  So when I say that, I am definitely saying it as a theory.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:10:27):**  We are a fairly new project.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:10:29):**  We've been around two years and we are very much still developing infrastructure.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:10:33):**  And this is experimental in a lot of ways for us as well.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:10:38):**  So what we found is that in the context we've created, people that come here often want  
**[0:10:47-0:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:10:47):**  to, they want to help in some way.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:10:50):**  They're grateful for the opportunity to be able to come here and to be here.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:10:54):**  And that doesn't cost them anything to do so.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:10:59):**  And most people are inspired to, we find, to create something.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:11:03):**  Just a couple of weeks ago, for example, we had a new guy come and spend two or three  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:11:08):**  weeks and he came with this really strong idea that, hey, I'd love to contribute like  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:11:13):**  a proper composting toilet to Zenith because you guys don't have one and you should really  
**[0:11:18-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:11:18):**  have that.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:11:19):**  And we said, yeah, that would be awesome.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:11:21):**  And for him, he just really wanted to give this gift because he wanted to be here.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:11:26):**  He wanted to hang out with us.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:11:28):**  And that was a gift.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:11:29):**  And at the same time, we also recognize that, yes, we're not looking to totally detach from  
**[0:11:34-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:11:34):**  the current economy.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:11:37):**  We're never going to produce our own phones, our own cars.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:11:41):**  And those are things that we're still going to realistically still need and want.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:11:45):**  So not to separate ourselves from money completely, but to take steps towards increasing the amount  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:11:51):**  of people's freedom so that we have more time to devote our highest purposes and spend less  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:11:56):**  time towards being trapped in a system of having a job or doing things that's not our  
**[0:12:02-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:12:02):**  highest calling.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:12:04):**  With that in mind, do you have any other personal experiences of living in communal settings?  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:12:10):**  And if so, or if not, have you identified any of the things that cause friction in communities  
**[0:12:16-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:12:16):**  like this, the points in which people tend to break apart or relationships or connections  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:12:22):**  often start to degrade?  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:12:25):**  And if so, what steps in this new community have you taken to remedy those?  
**[0:12:31-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:12:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:12:32):**  So my favorite example of a community that I've lived in and spent time in is probably  
**[0:12:39-0:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:12:39):**  one of the most well-known intentional communities.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:12:42):**  It's called Tamara in Portugal.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:12:45):**  And we've actually established quite a few of our own ways of being and values and philosophies  
**[0:12:51-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:12:51):**  and ways of doing things based on some successes we've seen there.  
**[0:12:55-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:12:55):**  And with that in mind, though, for every success like Tamara that there is, I think there's  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:13:02):**  a, I've done reading and had it seen it suggested that as high as nine out of 10 intentional  
**[0:13:08-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:13:08):**  community projects fail.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:13:10):**  And most of that does have to do with degradation of relationship like you've identified where  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:13:15):**  people don't stay together or they break apart because of personal conflict.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:13:20):**  And so what we observed going on in Tamara is that they, as opposed to putting any rules  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:13:30):**  or structures or hierarchies in place, there's actually a place of very high freedom.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:13:36):**  And what they really did prioritize though, what people did value and were in agreement  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:13:41):**  there about was that relationships came first.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:13:46):**  So they have a specific practice there they called forum.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:13:49):**  And what essentially that is, is there's a context where they regularly get together  
**[0:13:56-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:13:56):**  and it's a facilitated process where the community gets together and they share their fears,  
**[0:14:02-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:14:02):**  they share their insecurities, they share what's bothering them.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:14:05):**  They share their jealousies.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:14:07):**  They put out in the open and connect with each other over all the problems and uncomforts  
**[0:14:14-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:14:14):**  and insecurities and things that are not going well.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:14:17):**  And that just creates a really, really deep bond and caring and helps them see each other  
**[0:14:22-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:14:22):**  as humans and inspires cooperation and support rather than the urge to break apart or leave  
**[0:14:32-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:14:32):**  over a unresolvable conflict.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:14:35):**  I think that's the secret sauce or glue that's made them so successful.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:14:39):**  That's one of the things that we're trying to emulate here as well is it all comes down  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:14:43):**  to relationships and you've got to focus on that first.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:14:47):**  And so within the relationship structure of this community that you're building, what  
**[0:14:51-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:14:51):**  are some of the ways that you create further connection and collaboration with people who  
**[0:14:58-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:14:58):**  perhaps have differing goals as for the direction of the community, certainly of their own lives?  
**[0:15:04-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:15:04):**  How do you find connection within that?  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:15:06):**  Yeah, that's a great question.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:15:09):**  What we find is that people are attracted to hear by our values, by what we stand for,  
**[0:15:18-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:15:18):**  by what our vision is.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:15:20):**  This vision of, in our case, it's a vision of being free and living more wildly and rewilding,  
**[0:15:28-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:15:28):**  connecting with nature and also doing that in a mutually supportive, collaborative context  
**[0:15:34-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:15:34):**  that supports each other's highest purpose and being abundant.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:15:37):**  And so the social fabric really is based on those values.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:15:42):**  And I think for any community, intentional or otherwise, to be successful, and by successful,  
**[0:15:49-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:15:49):**  I mean that people really get along and they really like each other, is that you've got  
**[0:15:56-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:15:56):**  to have a common goal and purpose and values in mind.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:16:01):**  And that's what you can connect with.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:16:03):**  And when things are not going well, when things are uncomfortable or there is conflict, it's  
**[0:16:07-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:16:07):**  a grounding.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:16:08):**  It's something you can refocus on and go back to like, hey, why are we here?  
**[0:16:13-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:16:13):**  What brought us here in the first place?  
**[0:16:16-0:16:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:16:16):**  What's our common ground?  
**[0:16:17-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:16:17):**  What's our agreement on?  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:16:18):**  And you can go back to focusing on that and it helps reground people and remind them,  
**[0:16:22-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:16:22):**  hey, that's why we're here.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:16:23):**  That's what we're up to.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:16:24):**  Now, you mentioned a second ago that one of the things you aspire to is rewilding.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:16:30):**  Could you explain the concept of rewilding and how it has benefits for our individual  
**[0:16:35-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:16:35):**  lives and a community structure?  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:16:37):**  So I've heard a few different definitions for rewilding and there's numerous books on  
**[0:16:42-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:16:42):**  the topic.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:16:44):**  But for me, what that means is to experience life a little bit more as an animal and as  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:16:52):**  part of nature rather than as separate from nature.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:16:56):**  So to me, any time that you go out and you wildcraft or harvest your own food, wild food  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:17:05):**  out of nature, to me, that would be experience in rewilding.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:17:09):**  You're experiencing life as an animal, as part of nature, as opposed to going to a grocery  
**[0:17:14-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:17:14):**  store and purchasing it.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:17:15):**  That's a more wild experience.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:17:19):**  And the benefit of that is, as most people know, who spend time in nature, the reason  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:17:25):**  you go to nature is you feel more grounded, you feel more connected, you feel a sense  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:17:30):**  of calm.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:17:32):**  And a lot of stresses that you have that are created in our lives, they just tend to drop  
**[0:17:37-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:17:37):**  away.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:17:39):**  And so the more that you can incorporate being in nature and interacting with nature and  
**[0:17:45-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:17:45):**  making that part of your daily life from simple things like how you get your food, then that  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:17:56):**  experience of being in nature and those good feelings that we all associate with that becomes  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:18:02):**  a greater part of your reality and leads to a happier and more fulfilled life and a more  
**[0:18:08-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:18:08):**  connected life.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:18:09):**  Yeah, I can imagine.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:18:11):**  In my own experience, found so much enrichment in reconnecting with the sources of food and  
**[0:18:18-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:18:18):**  water and unity interactions that we've had in our own little small Mayan village in the  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:18:25):**  rural area of Guatemala where we've set up shop.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:18:29):**  And I've also had quite a bit of experience in working out or troubleshooting some of  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:18:33):**  the difficulties of living so closely with your collaborators.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:18:38):**  Can you tell me about some of the challenges that have come up working with others in identifying  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:18:43):**  the direction in which you're headed and how to go about achieving your goals?  
**[0:18:48-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:18:48):**  Yeah, so I'll actually tell you a story of what didn't work.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:18:55):**  So this project was originally founded by five people.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:19:01):**  And we had a meeting on the land and we camped out for a few days.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:19:06):**  We really went into our vision and our goals.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:19:09):**  And I advise anybody who's considering starting an intentional community of their own that  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:19:15):**  that's an essential process is to get clear on that before you even begin.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:19:21):**  And we did that.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:19:22):**  But once we actually began, one of the five people showed up and once we'd actually followed  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:19:30):**  through and been able to purchase this land, one of the five people showed up and started  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:19:35):**  doing things that were different from what we'd all discussed just a few months prior  
**[0:19:40-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:19:40):**  and what we thought we were all agreed on.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:19:43):**  And so we actually spent a couple of weeks just really digging into it and looking into  
**[0:19:49-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:19:49):**  ourselves and saying, hey, what's going on here?  
**[0:19:53-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:19:53):**  And that person ended up leaving the project because it turned out what they actually wanted  
**[0:19:59-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:19:59):**  was not consistent with our vision and what we had agreed on at the start.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:20:03):**  And I'm not saying that that's a success, but I think it's important.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:20:10):**  It brings home the point of any group or any tribe to thrive.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:20:15):**  There has to be a common sense of purpose.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:20:17):**  It can't be all over the place of people wanting divergent things.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:20:20):**  And it's okay sometimes for someone to leave the tribe and go find a place that is more  
**[0:20:25-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:20:25):**  in line with their vision.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:20:26):**  And so because of that person leaving, things actually immediately got better afterwards.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:20:33):**  We were more in alignment.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:20:34):**  We were more connected.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:20:36):**  We were not having that influence pulling us away from what we were up to.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:20:41):**  And so in some ways it's always sad to lose someone, but it was also a success at the  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:20:46):**  same time in not going further down a road of separation and differing priorities, especially  
**[0:20:52-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:20:52):**  at the early stages of a project.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:20:54):**  So you mentioned a little while ago about purchasing the land and how you did that as  
**[0:20:58-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:20:58):**  a group.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:20:59):**  Now one of the things that I really harp on on this show is really understanding the context  
**[0:21:05-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:21:05):**  in which you're operating before identifying visions and goals.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:21:09):**  So tell me a little bit about the concept of where your community is located and some  
**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:21:13):**  of the advantages and disadvantages for building a community there.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:21:17):**  Great question.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:21:19):**  So I'll actually start with probably our biggest disadvantage first, which depending on who  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:21:26):**  you ask is sometimes an advantage, sometimes a disadvantage.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:21:30):**  But we're located relatively remotely.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:21:34):**  We are about four hours from the nearest major city and over an hour from the nearest town  
**[0:21:42-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:21:42):**  of any size with any services.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:21:45):**  And we're located on a very mountainous, unpaved road, which is mostly suitable only for four  
**[0:21:52-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:21:52):**  by four vehicles.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:21:53):**  So for people to get here, they have to walk here.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:21:57):**  No one drives by and sees our signs, so to speak.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:22:01):**  And that disadvantage also is part of an advantage in what we're trying to create.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:22:10):**  So we're an experiment in allowing a new culture to emerge in the absence of the default societal  
**[0:22:20-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:22:20):**  culture.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:22:21):**  So being a little bit more remote like that means that it's not easy for someone to leave  
**[0:22:30-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:22:30):**  and to go for the night to a bar or some event in the default society, for example.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:22:37):**  It puts us in a context where we have to create our own culture because there is nothing else.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:22:42):**  And the other advantage of being in such a place is that we're able to select somewhere  
**[0:22:49-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:22:49):**  where land was not so expensive and also a place that is really beautiful and abundant.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:22:57):**  And we're very blessed in Canada to have not such a deep, a dense population density where  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:23:04):**  there still is a lot of places where you can go and you can get clean water, a beautiful  
**[0:23:08-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:23:08):**  environment, a relatively unspoiled nature, and you can be there.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:23:15):**  And then of course, the disadvantage of being with Canada, which you don't have in Guatemala,  
**[0:23:20-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:23:20):**  is that winters are cold here.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:23:22):**  It's very difficult to grow food year round without some sort of artificial climate modification  
**[0:23:27-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:23:27):**  or protection.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:23:28):**  And so a little bit more work and planning is involved in literally, especially living  
**[0:23:36-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:23:36):**  in an off-grid lifestyle to survive the winter and to live well.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:23:42):**  That's something you have to prepare for.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:23:44):**  Yeah, undoubtedly.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:23:46):**  And I would imagine that comes with its own unique challenges being cut off like that.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:23:51):**  I mean, what sort of safety measures or resilience do you have in case of emergency or in case  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:23:58):**  of the failure of one of your key resources, say water?  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:24:02):**  Fortunately, fortunately, the location we've chosen doesn't have an issue with clean water.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:24:08):**  We have multiple abundant sources of that.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:24:11):**  But probably our biggest challenge would be where we could have a major failure would  
**[0:24:18-0:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:24:18):**  be access.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:24:20):**  We currently rely on vehicles to get in and out.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:24:23):**  And if that breaks down, then that's a bit of a challenge.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:24:25):**  Our nearest neighbour is two kilometres away.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:24:29):**  So again, we really enjoy that level of freedom and independence where we can be in a place  
**[0:24:33-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:24:33):**  where we can really do what we want.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:24:37):**  And at the same time, it's also very revealing in that as much as we're a place of freedom  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:24:44):**  and experimentation, looking to see what happens in the absence of default society being present,  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:24:50):**  it also reminds us like, hey, we're still using technologies.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:24:54):**  We're trying to generate our own electricity.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:24:56):**  We're still using vehicles to get here and to leave here.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:25:00):**  We're still very much using technology and have a need for the default society.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:25:06):**  And it reminds us that there still is that relationship there.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:25:11):**  It's beautiful to experiment and create what is possible without it.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:25:16):**  And also reminds us, it makes it very, very clear and makes us appreciate a lot more what  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:25:22):**  technologies and things that we get from society that really make our lives a lot easier and  
**[0:25:27-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:25:27):**  that we benefit from.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:25:28):**  Now, you talked a little bit about developing a new culture.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:25:33):**  Tell me a little bit about how that is built up over the duration of this project.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:25:37):**  How long have you been there to begin with?  
**[0:25:40-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:25:40):**  We've been here almost two years now.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:25:42):**  Yeah, almost two years.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:25:43):**  Okay, so in two years, I would imagine a lot of challenges that perhaps you might not have  
**[0:25:49-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:25:49):**  anticipated.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:25:52):**  And at the same time, I'm sure a lot of things have surpassed your goals or some beautiful  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:25:57):**  aspects of the culture you're trying to create have emerged without having been preplanned.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:26:02):**  Could you talk about some of those things?  
**[0:26:04-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:26:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:26:05):**  So one thing that has come up that we've noticed quite a bit is we weren't expecting there  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:26:13):**  to be so much energy towards retreats.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:26:19):**  So this was originally envisioned as a place for friends and for new friends to get involved  
**[0:26:27-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:26:27):**  and it to be more of a place where people live.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:26:32):**  And we're going to develop our own community.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:26:34):**  And what's really emerged is that because of the remote location and rugged beauty,  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:26:47):**  this is a place that a lot of people want to come and host retreats.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:26:51):**  They want to host events.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:26:54):**  They want to host healing gatherings.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:26:56):**  They want to host permaculture workshops because it's just a very inspiring setting.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:27:02):**  And so a lot of the culture has actually become around, okay, how can we actually turn this  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:27:09):**  into a model?  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:27:13):**  Not just a place for ourselves to live, but a model.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:27:17):**  How can we experiment with different ways of natural building and construction that  
**[0:27:24-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:27:24):**  honor our local environment?  
**[0:27:26-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:27:26):**  How can we do permaculture and plant in ways that honor our local patterns and sunshine  
**[0:27:34-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:27:34):**  and water?  
**[0:27:35-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:27:35):**  And what's emerged is we've become more interested in becoming an example or a model for others  
**[0:27:43-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:27:43):**  that are interested in this kind of thing.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:27:46):**  And some little quirky things as far as culture goes that we've noticed that instead of in  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:27:53):**  the absence of being in a town where you might go up to a restaurant or a bar at night for  
**[0:27:58-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:27:58):**  adventure, we found joy in a lot more simple things, just like having a bonfire on the  
**[0:28:06-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:28:06):**  beach and sharing stories, making your own music, and found that that is just equally,  
**[0:28:13-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:28:13):**  if not more, satisfying and rewarding.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:28:15):**  Yeah, I love some of these ideas that you've brought up here, the change in focus more  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:28:22):**  towards those retreats, as you mentioned, and the culture that's come out of that.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:28:27):**  Now, I've got, I guess, two questions, but we'll just start with one.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:28:31):**  You mentioned a lot about permaculture management and up until this point, it's mostly been  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:28:36):**  referred through the lens of working with the ecology of the site.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:28:40):**  Have you also applied permaculture principles to the formation and the structure of your  
**[0:28:46-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:28:46):**  community?  
**[0:28:47-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:28:47):**  That's actually something that we could improve a lot on, Oliver.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:28:50):**  And most of our training in permaculture has been primarily through the lens of, as you  
**[0:28:58-0:29:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:28:58):**  would say, ecology of through plants and through gardening and through systems.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:29:06):**  And social permaculture is a concept I have some familiarity with.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:29:12):**  And that's something that I'd be really interested in learning, not only learning more about,  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:29:19):**  but that's also a really good opportunity for someone who would like it, who has that  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:29:24):**  skill and has that interest and is looking for a place to apply it.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:29:29):**  That's the sort of person that we would love to welcome to our community, because there's  
**[0:29:35-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:29:35):**  a lot of room for improvement in that area for us.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:29:37):**  That would be a big growth opportunity for us.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:29:39):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:29:40):**  Well, I hope my listeners are hearing that and we'll get in touch with you at the end  
**[0:29:44-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:29:44):**  of this episode after we give your contact information.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:29:46):**  But I definitely have seen a lot of fantastic applications of principles that have mostly  
**[0:29:54-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:29:54):**  been taught through ecological management and landscape management work wonders when  
**[0:30:00-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:30:00):**  you apply it to a different field of study.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:30:03):**  Because what I've found is that when you look at anything holistically, you find micro and  
**[0:30:07-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:30:07):**  macro expressions of it.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:30:09):**  So macro expressions are often manifest in larger ecological systems, say an entire watershed  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:30:16):**  or a microclimate of some type.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:30:20):**  Whereas it can be applied in a similar but slightly shifted in perspective direction  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:30:28):**  to community structures, to businesses, to politics.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:30:32):**  And these are some of the ways that I've been exploring a lot and I definitely have some  
**[0:30:36-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:30:36):**  people to put you in touch with.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:30:37):**  So let's talk a little bit after this episode.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:30:40):**  But that leads me to the second question that I was going to kind of explore with you.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:30:46):**  And that's this idea of freedom culture.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:30:49):**  I know that you're working closely with that organization, which is kind of defined freedom  
**[0:30:55-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:30:55):**  culture through their lens and promoting intentional communities and such.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:31:01):**  What does freedom mean to you in the concept or in the context that you have in your community?  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:31:07):**  And how is it manifesting in your own life with this change in lifestyle?  
**[0:31:12-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:31:12):**  Yeah, so the freedom culture movement is one that's just really inspiring to me.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:31:18):**  I've been to a lot of gatherings and events and retreats in my life where there's a lot  
**[0:31:23-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:31:23):**  of people who have really good intentions, really great ideas.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:31:29):**  But the number of people or the percentage of people who are actually living their life  
**[0:31:35-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:31:35):**  as is and really going after their highest purpose and making that their lifestyle is  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:31:42):**  I've generally found is a lot more sparse and less common.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:31:47):**  And what I love about the freedom culture movement is if you ever go to any of their  
**[0:31:52-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:31:52):**  events or retreats, it's people who are not only looking to make a difference in the world  
**[0:31:59-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:31:59):**  and do so in a regenerative, sustainable way.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:32:02):**  But these people are doing it, these people are the people who are living their life and  
**[0:32:07-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:32:07):**  living as is.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:32:10):**  And they're active in fulfilling and chasing their highest purpose.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:32:14):**  And so that's what we're as a freedom culture affiliated community here at Zenith.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:32:19):**  That's one of the things that we're committed to as well is supporting people in living  
**[0:32:25-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:32:25):**  their highest purpose, in following their passion to help our world.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:32:31):**  We all know that there's a lot of destructive things going on in the world.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:32:36):**  And we do whatever we can here to support like-minded people in breaking away from what  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:32:43):**  I would consider to be the negative aspects of the default society like we talked about  
**[0:32:48-0:32:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:32:48):**  earlier, which is enslavement to a job you don't like just to get by.  
**[0:32:53-0:33:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:32:53):**  So we help people with breaking free of that and support them as much as we can in living  
**[0:33:02-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:33:02):**  their dream of making this world a better place within the context of community.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:33:06):**  I love that, but I'm always sort of hitting up against a little bit of friction with this  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:33:11):**  concept of freedom.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:33:13):**  And it's one of the primary, I would say, challenges or criticisms that I hear from  
**[0:33:19-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:33:19):**  the outside as people wax poetic or idealistic about this idea of freedom.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:33:26):**  And the way I've come to understand it is that freedom is sort of on many different  
**[0:33:31-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:33:31):**  levels.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:33:33):**  And on the lower levels, you're free to do something, but you may not be able to do it.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:33:38):**  Like, man, I'm free to buy an apartment block in New York City and completely regenerate  
**[0:33:43-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:33:43):**  the place, but I lack the ability to do something.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:33:46):**  And in this way, freedom is only as powerful as your ability to express it.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:33:52):**  So there may not be something preventing you from exercising the freedom, but you also  
**[0:33:57-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:33:57):**  lack the ability or the financial resources or any other type of resource to actually  
**[0:34:01-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:34:01):**  make it happen.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:34:03):**  And the criticism that I find in this style of living is that, you know, you may have  
**[0:34:08-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:34:08):**  this ultimate freedom where no one is coming in and checking on you and you can really  
**[0:34:12-0:34:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:34:12):**  do what you want.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:34:13):**  But the way it manifests is that many people are dedicating all of their time just to providing  
**[0:34:18-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:34:18):**  their basic needs because an infrastructure that provides it for them is not there.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:34:22):**  Have you found that to be somewhat of a conundrum in your community model where you are free  
**[0:34:27-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:34:27):**  to do things, but you still find most of your time taken up by creating or providing the  
**[0:34:35-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:34:35):**  necessary ingredients, the necessary resources for living a comfortable and sustainable lifestyle?  
**[0:34:42-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:34:42):**  Yeah, and that's a great point, Oliver.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:34:45):**  And I am very guilty sometimes of waxing poetic and idealistic.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:34:51):**  That's actually one of the criticisms that people in our community give to me sometimes.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:34:58):**  I can be a little bit far in the visionary standpoint.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:35:02):**  And so what you're saying is absolutely true.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:35:05):**  There are days where, you know, especially in Canada where it's like, hey guys, we got  
**[0:35:10-0:35:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:35:10):**  to just chop firewood today.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:35:12):**  You know, we want to be warm this winter.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:35:15):**  And you know, we need to spend a whole day just chopping firewood.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:35:17):**  And that might not be what everyone really wants to do, what they would freely choose  
**[0:35:20-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:35:20):**  to do.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:35:22):**  And so, yes, the reality is, of course, there is compromise.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:35:28):**  Of course, there is.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:35:30):**  Of course, no one actually does just whatever they want all the time.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:35:34):**  But I would also say that the concept of freedom to someone who is newly emerging from the  
**[0:35:42-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:35:42):**  default society is that thought of like, oh, I can just kind of do whatever.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:35:48):**  But I think true freedom is once you realize that, hey, I can just do whatever, most people  
**[0:35:57-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:35:57):**  after they've done that for a little bit realize that ultimately that's not actually fulfilling.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:36:02):**  Doing work that is meaningful, is helpful to your community, and is helpful to others.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:36:09):**  While you know, that can feel like a grind, if you're doing it because you don't want  
**[0:36:15-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:36:15):**  to.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:36:16):**  But there's actually the majority of the time I find when I'm at Zenith here, is that I  
**[0:36:22-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:36:22):**  like building projects, I like working in the gardens.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:36:26):**  I actually really enjoy and freely choose to spend my time doing that because it makes  
**[0:36:31-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:36:31):**  this place better, it makes it more abundant.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:36:34):**  It leads to a better life for the community.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:36:37):**  In my situation of freedom, I could go buy an apartment in wherever and transform into  
**[0:36:44-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:36:44):**  a generative place like you're talking about, but this is what I freely choose to do with  
**[0:36:48-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:36:48):**  my time.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:36:49):**  So yes, of course, there's limitations.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:36:52):**  And at the same time, I also challenge people to consider that meaningful work is actually  
**[0:36:57-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:36:57):**  one of the most fun things that you can do with your time out of your freedom.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:37:02):**  Yeah, I really like that perspective.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:37:05):**  And please don't get me wrong that I'm criticizing anybody for waxing poetic about what they're  
**[0:37:10-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:37:10):**  passionate about.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:37:11):**  Certainly I'm guilty of that as well.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:37:13):**  And I think there's actually a lot of value in creating a meaningful narrative, however  
**[0:37:17-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:37:17):**  idealistic it might be for people to aspire to.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:37:21):**  And if you're constantly giving them only the realistic or kind of compromised version  
**[0:37:27-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:37:27):**  of the ideals, it can disincentivize people to really put in the energy and the effort  
**[0:37:31-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:37:31):**  to reach the ideals that you would otherwise use to inspire them.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:37:35):**  So don't get me wrong on that point.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:37:37):**  I just always like to play devil's advocate because I'm a very logical, somewhat neurotic,  
**[0:37:42-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:37:42):**  holistic design focused person.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:37:47):**  It's like everybody's idea of freedom is different.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:37:51):**  And the ability to express it is also different based on the education we were given, the  
**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:37:57):**  advantages we were given from a young age, the resources and information that we had  
**[0:38:02-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:38:02):**  access to at a later point.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:38:04):**  And so how do you accommodate many different community members idea of freedom in a collaborative  
**[0:38:12-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:38:12):**  like this?  
**[0:38:14-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:38:14):**  Great question.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:38:15):**  And that's one of the, I mentioned Tamara in Portugal earlier in the podcast here.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:38:22):**  And the example I saw there was where we've taken a lot of inspiration from.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:38:29):**  And I still sometimes when I think of it, I am surprised by how beautifully it works  
**[0:38:35-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:38:35):**  out.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:38:36):**  So if you imagine this, they are a community of 170 or so people, plus usually 50 to 60  
**[0:38:43-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:38:43):**  guests visiting at any given time.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:38:45):**  So quite large as far as an intentional community goes.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:38:50):**  And most people would assume, oh, you must have some sort of a system around work or  
**[0:38:55-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:38:55):**  some sort of rules or some sort of structure around it.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:38:58):**  But because they've prioritized relationships and cooperation with each other and they aren't  
**[0:39:07-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:39:07):**  people that are there sharing a common vision, the way, and it still boggles my mind how  
**[0:39:13-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:39:13):**  well it works and it works well here too, is that leaders are not chosen, leaders emerge.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:39:22):**  And leaders emerge out of a combination of what people are inspired for and also the  
**[0:39:27-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:39:27):**  daily grind, what's necessary.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:39:30):**  And so the people who will lead doing the gardening and growing the food are not someone  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:39:37):**  who got elected, but the people who have energy and passion to do it and other people are  
**[0:39:41-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:39:41):**  interested in and willing to follow.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:39:44):**  And so a very common occurrence there, and this is what we do at Zenith as well, is we'll  
**[0:39:50-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:39:50):**  get together in the morning over breakfast and people will say like, okay, here, I think  
**[0:39:55-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:39:55):**  these are our priorities today.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:39:57):**  Here's what I am noticing that needs to be done.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:40:00):**  And then people will share, hey, here's what I'm excited about.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:40:03):**  Here's what I would really love to get to today.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:40:05):**  And then everybody present naturally organizes themselves and says, okay, yeah, I'll do  
**[0:40:11-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:40:11):**  that.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:40:12):**  Okay, I'll do the gardening today.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:40:15):**  I'll make dinner.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:40:16):**  You make breakfast and I'll work on the composting toilet project over there.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:40:22):**  And people naturally organize themselves in an empowered way and everything kind of just  
**[0:40:27-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:40:27):**  works out to get done.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:40:28):**  And usually there's plenty of time left when you make time for it to do what we really  
**[0:40:34-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:40:34):**  want to do, whether that's here, that might be hanging out at the beach or going for a  
**[0:40:39-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:40:39):**  walk or it could be working on our website for our newest project, for our own personal  
**[0:40:46-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:40:46):**  project.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:40:47):**  But the ability of people to self-organize and meet each other's needs and meet the  
**[0:40:53-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:40:53):**  community's needs, even in the absence of any formal structures, I've found is really  
**[0:40:59-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:40:59):**  amazing when you believe in it.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:41:01):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:41:02):**  I like how you pointed out how structures and organizations tend to just form themselves  
**[0:41:08-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:41:08):**  naturally and that leaders emerge rather than are elected in this intimate setting.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:41:14):**  Certainly as you scale up in community size, different forms of organization tend to emerge  
**[0:41:20-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:41:20):**  and that's how governments get created to begin with.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:41:24):**  But I really like this intimate setting and I feel like there's a lot of room even within  
**[0:41:28-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:41:28):**  larger communities for smaller, more intimate communities to take more control of their  
**[0:41:33-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:41:33):**  everyday lives and incentivize collaboration for the benefit of the collective.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:41:40):**  And I guess my question for that is, from what you've seen in the short time that your  
**[0:41:45-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:41:45):**  community has been formed, have you seen much of an ability for each individual to reach  
**[0:41:51-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:41:51):**  their own highest potential, either through support of the group or by making time for  
**[0:41:56-0:42:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:41:56):**  themselves to pursue what it is they're passionate about?  
**[0:42:00-0:42:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:42:00):**  Yeah, great question.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:42:02):**  So what we've noticed is that how much that happens is based on how much we bring that  
**[0:42:10-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:42:10):**  into the conversation.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:42:12):**  And so the more that we bring up in our conversations, the deep purpose of what we're about here,  
**[0:42:20-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:42:20):**  what our vision is and how we're supporting and our vision is to support and enable people  
**[0:42:25-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:42:25):**  to live their highest purpose, then the more that happens.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:42:28):**  So life is created in a conversation.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:42:31):**  First of all, I would say.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:42:34):**  And second of all, yes.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:42:36):**  And it's not overnight, it's a process.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:42:39):**  So for example, one of our community members, she really, really loves art and is really  
**[0:42:48-0:42:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:42:48):**  interested in the intersection of art with also design and construction.  
**[0:42:55-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:42:55):**  And so she's actually been able to incorporate a lot of her dreams of things she wants to  
**[0:43:01-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:43:01):**  experiment with and play with into some of our infrastructure here.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:43:06):**  For her, that's really exciting is examining how can we take the conventional model of  
**[0:43:12-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:43:12):**  a square wall building and how can we turn that design on its heads?  
**[0:43:16-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:43:16):**  What about if we approach it from the perspective of art rather than from the perspective of  
**[0:43:22-0:43:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:43:22):**  engineering and mathematics?  
**[0:43:25-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:43:25):**  And as a result, we've got a couple spaces here, which are, they look more like art than  
**[0:43:32-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:43:32):**  buildings, but they're just a total joy to be in.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:43:35):**  And it brings a lot of positive energy to the community because she's been given space  
**[0:43:40-0:43:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:43:40):**  to just create and just do what inspires her.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:43:43):**  Oh, I love that.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:43:44):**  You're going to put me in touch with that person.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:43:47):**  Those are some of the things that I'm most passionate about as well.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:43:50):**  Maybe we could have a great conversation.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:43:52):**  But hey, look, before we start to wrap things up, I would really love to know from your  
**[0:43:56-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:43:56):**  perspective, your opinion, what advice you would have for people who want to pursue this  
**[0:44:01-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:44:01):**  type of living, perhaps not as drastically as leaving so far off the grid and away from  
**[0:44:07-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:44:07):**  the infrastructure we've come to rely on.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:44:10):**  But how could someone get started in a more, let's say, positive and freedom promoting  
**[0:44:17-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:44:17):**  community structure?  
**[0:44:20-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:44:20):**  So I'm not someone who, as radical as I may be, I'm not someone who actually would say  
**[0:44:27-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:44:27):**  like, hey, you should quit your job tomorrow and just go full in and join intentional communities.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:44:35):**  Because that's going to be a big shock and transition.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:44:38):**  And most people just, that's too much of a shift.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:44:42):**  It just doesn't make sense.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:44:44):**  So I would, to use the analogy of dating, of relationships, getting into a community  
**[0:44:54-0:44:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:44:54):**  is more like dating someone.  
**[0:44:56-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:44:56):**  It's more like a relationship, especially an intentional community that's based on relationships.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:45:01):**  And I would say, keep doing what you're doing, but think of it as like dating a new person.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:45:08):**  Go and visit them and be really curious and get to know them and open yourself to their  
**[0:45:15-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:45:15):**  perspectives and their way of seeing things.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:45:20):**  And start with that.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:45:21):**  And if that's something that you like, and that's something that feels really good to  
**[0:45:25-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:45:25):**  you and inspires you, then that community or that group of people will naturally find  
**[0:45:32-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:45:32):**  a way for you to integrate more.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:45:34):**  And if it's not a good fit, then you haven't lost anything.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:45:38):**  You still have your life that you can continue on with and go back to.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:45:42):**  Yeah, I think that's good advice for so many different things.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:45:45):**  Like you mentioned, relationships as well.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:45:47):**  It would be nice if we could try jobs out that way.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:45:51):**  I think a lot of things would benefit by having sort of a trial period and a deep sort of  
**[0:45:57-0:46:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:45:57):**  introspection as to how your life fits in around the endeavor that you're pursuing.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:46:03):**  So before I let you go, can you tell our listeners how they can contact you, learn more about  
**[0:46:08-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:46:08):**  the structure of your community and find out more information about intentional communities  
**[0:46:13-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:46:13):**  in general?  
**[0:46:14-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:46:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:46:15):**  So if people want to see a little more about what we're up to, they can reach us on the  
**[0:46:21-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:46:21):**  web at visitzenith.org.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:46:26):**  Zenith is Z-E-N-I-T-H, or if you're American, I guess it's Z-E-N-I-T-H. Visitzenith.org.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:46:36):**  And we have some very basic information on our website about what we're about and our  
**[0:46:41-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:46:41):**  values.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:46:43):**  And we're also very much an offline community.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:46:47):**  We don't put out videos daily on Facebook or posts on Instagram.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:46:51):**  We really value connecting in person.  
**[0:46:53-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:46:53):**  And so if we're a place that intrigues you, then you'll find our contact information on  
**[0:47:01-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:47:01):**  the website.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:47:03):**  You can get in touch with us and we'll go from there.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:47:07):**  We invite anybody potentially that feels like-minded to come and at least visit us as guests.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:47:13):**  And as I said in my last answer to your last question, we're open for dating.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:47:20):**  But intentional communities in general, there is a huge network of them around the world  
**[0:47:26-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:47:26):**  and more than most people think.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:47:28):**  So I don't actually know a lot of directories for that, but what I would suggest really  
**[0:47:39-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:47:39):**  is get in touch with people that do permaculture, people that grow organic food, people that  
**[0:47:47-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:47:47):**  are into natural building, people that are into conscious art.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:47:52):**  These are typically the kind of people who will be plugged into what sort of communities  
**[0:47:59-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:47:59):**  and different things are going on in an area because a lot of things are relatively underground.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:48:05):**  Some of them are as simple as community houses in a city that do guerrilla gardening and  
**[0:48:10-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:48:10):**  stuff like that.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:48:11):**  And a lot of them aren't really going to have a presence online or on Facebook necessarily.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:48:19):**  So it's really, you've just got to go and meet the kind of people who are close to that  
**[0:48:25-0:48:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:48:25):**  scene and do things a little bit the old fashioned way sometimes and just get to know people.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:48:30):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:48:32):**  And though you may not have access to some bigger networks, I would definitely point  
**[0:48:36-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:48:36):**  people in the direction of the Global Eco-Village Network, for which I'll put a link in the  
**[0:48:41-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:48:41):**  show notes for this podcast, as well as all the resources that you've mentioned.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:48:45):**  And there is an increasing amount of collaboration and organization among communities like this,  
**[0:48:52-0:48:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:48:52):**  including tons of resources from everything from taking responsibility for resources,  
**[0:48:58-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:48:58):**  waste streams, all the way to conflict resolution and how to put in productive or regenerative  
**[0:49:05-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:49:05):**  bylaws to give your Eco-Village or intentional community the best chance at success that  
**[0:49:12-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:49:12):**  it might have.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:49:13):**  And I'm actually looking to interview more people from that network, especially on the  
**[0:49:17-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:49:17):**  topics like I just mentioned, so that people can increasingly find success in the collaboration  
**[0:49:22-0:49:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:49:22):**  and in the community models that they most aspire to.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:49:27):**  So yeah, so on that note, let's wrap things up.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:49:29):**  I know you've got a busy day ahead, but let's stay in touch because I'm actually going to  
**[0:49:34-0:49:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:49:34):**  be not too close to you, but in the Vancouver, Canada area this summer.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:49:40):**  And I would love to connect further if we get the chance.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:49:42):**  So thanks so much for taking the time today and for a very insightful look at a unique  
**[0:49:49-0:49:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:49:49):**  and alternative way of living that I think more people should aspire to.  
**[0:49:53-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-peter-wildemann/#t=0:49:53):**  It's been great chatting with you, Oliver.

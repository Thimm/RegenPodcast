### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 19 May 2017 15:42:28)
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to this episode of The Abundant Edge, the podcast all about the worlds of  
**[0:00:04-0:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:04):**  natural building, permaculture, and regenerative living.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:07):**  I'm your host Oliver Gautier and I have a fantastic interview for you today, so let's  
**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:12):**  jump right on in.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:13):**  Now my interview today is with one of the designers and changemakers that has most influenced  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:26):**  my own approach to professional projects and regenerative landscape development.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:31):**  Darren Doherty is the founder of Regrarian's LTD based in Bendigo, Australia, and he has  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:37):**  extensive experience in project design, development, management, and training.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:42):**  He's worked in six continents and nearly 50 countries in mostly broad-acre agricultural  
**[0:00:47-0:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:47):**  applications.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:49):**  The Regrarian's purpose that he promotes through his business is to provide the potential  
**[0:00:53-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:53):**  for people to be informed about the regenerative economy, whether it involves work in agriculture,  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:59):**  land management, corporate life, domestic services, manufacturing, or other activities  
**[0:01:04-0:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:04):**  that are within the reasonable domain of humans.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:07):**  In this episode, Darren talks extensively about the innovative platform and ethics that  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:11):**  his organization promotes, how he got started as a landscape designer and began teaching  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:16):**  with Bill Mollison, the co-founder of permaculture, and he gives essential advice on how to build  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:21):**  soils that are a little counterintuitive to how many people have learned with mulch and  
**[0:01:26-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:26):**  compost.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:27):**  This is another really in-depth interview and I'd advise having a notebook on hand  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:31):**  as Darren goes into detail about a lot of the science behind soil building and carbon  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:35):**  sequestering in a regenerative landscape.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:39):**  Just a quick disclaimer before we get started, I recorded this episode on Mother's Day  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:43):**  here in a little town of Sununah in Guatemala where I'm at at the moment.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:48):**  The town held a big concert in the square right next to where I live and the music started  
**[0:01:52-0:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:52):**  right as Darren and I got started.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:54):**  I did my best to edit all of the music and the noise, but just bear with me if at some  
**[0:01:59-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:59):**  point some of the music gets through and it is just a little bit distracting.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:02):**  Darren and I have a good laugh about the whole thing at the end of the interview and it all  
**[0:02:07-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:07):**  went pretty well considering.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:08):**  Just before we get started, don't forget to tune in at the end of this episode for  
**[0:02:12-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:12):**  some exclusive information on upcoming workshops.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:15):**  Now here's Darren Doherty from Regrarians LTD.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:18):**  Hey Darren, thank you so much for being with me today.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:22):**  How are you doing down there?  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:23):**  Yeah, I'm really well thanks Oliver, really nice to talk to you.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:27):**  Hey, it's totally my pleasure.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:28):**  Well, I've got a ton of questions that I would love to ask you and my listeners would  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:32):**  love to hear from as well, so why don't we just jump right on in?  
**[0:02:35-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:35):**  Sounds great.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:36):**  Alright, so let's start at the beginning.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:39):**  Let's start by talking a little bit about your background and how you got into the work  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:42):**  that you do now.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:46):**  My background is probably a bit different to what a lot of people is.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:52):**  It really starts with my father being killed in Vietnam when I'm three or four months  
**[0:02:59-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:59):**  old and at the time my 21 year old mother and I were living at her parents' farm,  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:03:08):**  my maternal grandparents.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:03:11):**  And that wasn't expected of course and as a result my grandfather who was in his early  
**[0:03:19-0:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:03:19):**  50s at the time and my grandmother who was only 44 took us on as it were and with that  
**[0:03:29-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:03:29):**  granddad effectively became, and Nana, but particularly granddad out in the field became  
**[0:03:35-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:03:35):**  this rural mentor, so I probably would have been straight into suburbia had my father  
**[0:03:45-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:03:45):**  lived and so I started really there.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:03:51):**  So we spent the first few years of my life there and then because of that bond with the  
**[0:03:56-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:03:56):**  place and my Nana and granddad when my mother remarried and we did move into town with her  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:04:03):**  new husband, my stepfather, my dad, I'd go out there all the time.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:04:09):**  I was out there every holidays, a lot of weekends as labor and willingly because I loved it  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:04:18):**  out there.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:04:19):**  I saw it as being my real home and I helped my grandfather right up until they sold the  
**[0:04:27-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:04:27):**  place which was about 1998 I think.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:04:35):**  And yeah, so it really started there.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:04:38):**  After that I, when I was about 18 I left school and got involved in hospitality as a lot of  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:04:49):**  people do at that age, especially those who don't go and go to university as I never did.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:04:55):**  And I got involved in the food and it was really food that started to really jump out  
**[0:05:01-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:05:01):**  at me and I got involved in hospitality initially as a waiter and then I became a chef and really  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:05:09):**  got engaged with food and local food particularly when I was working in Tasmania.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:05:13):**  I was talking with a very young executive chef in a five-star international hotel and  
**[0:05:23-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:05:23):**  he was only 28 and he was, we had a lot of providores coming in and farmers coming to  
**[0:05:29-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:05:29):**  the back door with the product and very innovative products and that and a few of the young chefs  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:05:36):**  that I was working with otherwise, you know, were really interested in the farming and  
**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:05:40):**  how the story of the food and et cetera.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:05:43):**  So my farming background brought me back into that and it wasn't that long before I left  
**[0:05:49-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:05:49):**  hospitality probably and I got a job and I wanted to get out anyway because of the schedule  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:05:57):**  of hospitality is always, you're always working while the people are eating and then cleaning  
**[0:06:03-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:03):**  up after.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:04):**  I know that, I've done plenty of that work as well.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:05):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah, as a lot of people have.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:07):**  It's just, it's a, you know, it's a stay in it over the duration of hats off to people  
**[0:06:11-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:11):**  who do.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:12):**  But I got a job, I moved back home to Bédigo and I was working about an hour away and it  
**[0:06:22-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:22):**  was a really hard job to get to and I didn't have accommodation.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:28):**  It was just tough and I started going to the local organic shop and organic grocery and  
**[0:06:36-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:36):**  struck up a friendship as you do with the shopkeepers and got in and we started talking  
**[0:06:44-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:44):**  and they said, oh, we need someone to manage the place.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:46):**  So I took on that job, which was great.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:50):**  And that put me in really good contact with a whole host of growers and here in central  
**[0:06:57-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:57):**  Victoria, it's one of the epicentres of organic agriculture on the planet.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:07:04):**  And so I was, this is nearly 30 years ago, I was in contact with a whole host of really  
**[0:07:13-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:07:13):**  innovative growers and producers and processes.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:07:23):**  And it sort of started my consulting career, if you like, started by me answering their  
**[0:07:31-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:07:31):**  questions of, because they'd say, what's this guy over here doing?  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:07:37):**  I heard, you know, Oliver, what is, what's he doing about growing his carrots or growing  
**[0:07:42-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:07:42):**  his potatoes or looking after his cattle?  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:07:45):**  And I'd answer, I'd say, oh, Oliver's doing this.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:07:49):**  And so it's sort of, my job really hasn't changed that much since then because so much  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:07:54):**  of what I do now is saying, all right, well, I've got a client who'll say, oh, you know,  
**[0:07:59-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:07:59):**  I've got this particular problem.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:00):**  Well, I'll say, well, Oliver over here, he's doing this and Ben over here is doing this  
**[0:08:05-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:05):**  and Megan over here is doing this.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:08):**  Maybe you want to talk.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:09):**  So it really did start at the shop counter.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:13):**  And it has been really a form of hospitality the whole way through as often.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:18):**  So let me see if I understand this correctly.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:21):**  Because of your middleman position, communicating with all these different growers and producers,  
**[0:08:26-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:26):**  they came to you asking advice based on what you've heard from others.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:29):**  And that's how you got started in consulting?  
**[0:08:33-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:33):**  And how did it turn into a full-time job for you?  
**[0:08:36-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:36):**  And when did that transition turn into the Regrarians platform that you use now?  
**[0:08:45-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:45):**  The transition occurred when I had a few people who were what you might class as homesteaders.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:53):**  We call them blockies or hobby farmers.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:57):**  People with small acreages around Bendigo, the peri-urban type folks who were customers  
**[0:09:03-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:09:03):**  of ours at the shop.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:09:06):**  And I can remember one said, oh, can you maybe you can come out and help me with my place,  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:09:13):**  show me where I should put things or set up my garden and that sort of thing.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:09:17):**  So it sort of just started there while I was still working at the shop.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:09:21):**  And it just sort of grew from there.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:09:23):**  And Lisa and I, my wife, who I met at the shop, we started talking about it and just  
**[0:09:34-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:09:34):**  one thing led to another.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:09:36):**  So I did a business plan training course, which was for six weeks.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:09:44):**  And that gave me the opportunity to do a whole business plan on some of the idea of setting  
**[0:09:49-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:09:49):**  up a land planning consultancy.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:09:52):**  And so we did that and I succeeded in that.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:09:55):**  And that gave us at the end a year long subsidy, which was equivalent to the unemployment benefit  
**[0:10:01-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:01):**  of the time.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:03):**  And so that was really great start to our first year of business.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:09):**  And in that year, I did some different trainings.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:12):**  I did a key line training, which I'd already been OK with because we'd done a lot of key  
**[0:10:18-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:18):**  line work on our farm.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:21):**  And I've seen a lot of farmers in the district who'd used key line.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:24):**  And then I also did a permaculture design course later in the year, which also brought  
**[0:10:32-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:32):**  a lot of things together.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:33):**  And so off we went.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:36):**  And in order to keep the cash flowing, because cash flow is king, it always is.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:43):**  It doesn't matter when you are in your business or where you are in your business life, but  
**[0:10:49-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:49):**  certainly when you're starting off.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:51):**  And it seemed to me that when I was young, I was only 24 or something like that, had  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:57):**  a lot more energy than I have now, although I still can feel the energetic.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:11:02):**  That I wanted to really go out and develop the designs that I was coming up with.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:11:09):**  And that was attractive to our clientele to say, all right, well, here's someone who can  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:11:15):**  not only design your place, but can come out and do the installation.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:11:20):**  And so that was really good because it meant if I was just the designer, then I only got  
**[0:11:23-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:11:23):**  design income.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:11:24):**  And that might be 10 jobs a year, for example, in 1993.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:11:31):**  Whereas if you've got 10 jobs a year and you're doing the install, that starts to be a business  
**[0:11:38-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:11:38):**  that you can get by with.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:11:41):**  And so it sort of grew from there.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:11:44):**  And so over time, we got up to about 100, 150 designs a year, probably about 30% of  
**[0:11:52-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:11:52):**  those being installed with the whole team and so on.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:11:56):**  And that took us right up until the end of that decade, the 90s and into the noughties.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:12:02):**  And then I've done a few more trainings over time and struck up a friendship with Bill  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:12:07):**  Mollison, the permaculture co-founder or co-originator.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:12:12):**  And Bill said to me in about 1999, he said, oh, it's about time you started to teach.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:12:18):**  And so he invited me to come and co-teach a PD, a permaculture design course with him  
**[0:12:24-0:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:12:24):**  in Tasmania.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:12:27):**  And I was down there.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:12:29):**  So I went down and did a couple of those with him and that sort of showed to us and the  
**[0:12:35-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:12:35):**  feedback that I got from the various crowds there that I had some skill in that area as  
**[0:12:44-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:12:44):**  a trainer.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:12:45):**  And so we did that and then I got a job working overseas with Mars Incorporated.  
**[0:12:55-0:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:12:55):**  So that was just a straight first time I really had one client who I worked with and nobody  
**[0:13:03-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:03):**  else.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:04):**  And we worked with them for three years and we moved to Vietnam, hence my sympathy with  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:10):**  some of your background noise of living in a rural village.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:14):**  I actually spent a lot of time in Vietnam as well.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:16):**  I know how it can be over there.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:18):**  It's a beautiful country.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:19):**  It is.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:20):**  You said you were there for three years?  
**[0:13:21-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:21):**  Yeah, yeah, which was really important to – I mean, it was the first overseas job  
**[0:13:28-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:28):**  I got and it was kind of poignant that my father was lost there and I'd sort of – as  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:36):**  you would imagine, I always had a fascination for the place.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:40):**  And so there was a lot of catharsis in working there and embedding ourselves.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:47):**  Like our whole family moved there.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:49):**  So we had some pretty young kids at that stage, so three young kids.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:55):**  So that was pretty good because that was both a training and I was training trainers and  
**[0:14:03-0:14:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:14:03):**  I was doing the design and development for Mars Incorporated, the big food company, private  
**[0:14:09-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:14:09):**  food company.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:14:12):**  So we did that and that really consolidated this – the training to what we do.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:14:23):**  And then we say – I talked to Alan Yeomans, P.A. Yeomans' son.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:14:29):**  We've had Yeomans' plough since 1994, so I've been mates with him for a long time.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:14:33):**  And I was talking to him and he said, I've got my latest book coming out and that's  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:14:37):**  about global warming and blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:14:40):**  So we talked and he showed me that a 1.6 percent increase in soil carbon in the top 30 centimetres  
**[0:14:49-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:14:49):**  or foot of topsoil on the world's 5 billion hectares of agricultural land, if we were  
**[0:14:56-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:14:56):**  to get that increase in soil carbon by 1.6 percent, then that would download 100 parts  
**[0:15:04-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:15:04):**  per million of CO2 out of the atmosphere.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:15:06):**  And I went, wow, that's pretty amazing.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:15:09):**  And he was the first person to come up with that and he wrote about it in his book, Priority  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:15:13):**  1, How Together We Can Save the World from Global Warming.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:15:18):**  And Lisa and I had saved up about 50 or 60 grand to build a house on our small farm and  
**[0:15:23-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:15:23):**  we went, you know what, we couldn't have this information and not talk about it.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:15:29):**  So we designed a world tour, bought five sets of round world tickets and did the world's  
**[0:15:37-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:15:37):**  first carbon farming tour.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:15:39):**  It was called the Soil, Water and Carbon for Every Farm Tour in 2007.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:15:46):**  And it was based around, we did mainly keyline courses.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:15:50):**  Anyway, we carried on with that.  
**[0:15:52-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:15:52):**  We did that work, we did a 13 month tour from February to April of 2007, 2008.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:01):**  And then we followed that up in 2009.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:04):**  And while we were doing that, I got invited by all of Australia's holistic management  
**[0:16:10-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:10):**  educators.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:12):**  I think with the exception of one or two, they'd all got together and they'd said, well,  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:18):**  our weak link is land planning.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:20):**  So they invited me to come and teach them land planning.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:23):**  And when I was preparing for that, one of these holistic management educators also taught  
**[0:16:29-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:29):**  keyline at a community college.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:32):**  And I said to him, so how do you teach keyline?  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:34):**  He said, I use the keyline scale of permanence, which I'd always in my keyline trainings always  
**[0:16:39-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:39):**  talked about.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:42):**  And of course, because it's a really big part of keyline.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:45):**  But I went, really?  
**[0:16:47-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:47):**  And he goes, I said, so how?  
**[0:16:49-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:49):**  And he said, well, I started climate and I go through and I do land shape, I do water  
**[0:16:55-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:55):**  and blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:56):**  And I went, blow me down with a feather.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:58):**  You know, it was one of those moments where something had been there in front of you the  
**[0:17:04-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:04):**  whole time.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:05):**  Because go back to 1998, I think it was Bill Mollison asked me to write a book and he said,  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:12):**  I want you guys are really good at process because we were handling lots of clients.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:18):**  And I had, I templated everything I read.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:22):**  I was an early reader of Michael Gerber's, the entrepreneurial myth, the E-myth, where  
**[0:17:28-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:28):**  you try to systemize everything.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:30):**  So I had all of those systems, but and I had what I called our works pattern.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:37):**  You know, there was the client came in, you interviewed them, you did your side analysis,  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:44):**  you did your concept plan, your feedback, detail planning, got all your costings and  
**[0:17:48-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:48):**  approvals, did the job and then you had management over time.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:52):**  That was our sort of pattern.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:54):**  And we worked along that basis.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:56):**  But that didn't necessarily work well for training, especially something like Keyline,  
**[0:18:01-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:01):**  it wasn't inclusive enough.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:03):**  And so when the Keyline Scale of Terminates was put before me, I immediately changed over  
**[0:18:09-0:18:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:09):**  to that.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:10):**  Now, can you explain to me what does the term of R  
**[0:18:22-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:22):**  agrarian mean and the platform and ethics that you promote that goes along with it?  
**[0:18:23-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:23):**  Well, agrarian was a word that I came up with.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:24):**  The term region agrarian, well, a friend of mine, Ed Collins, came up with the term in  
**[0:18:32-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:32):**  a letter, but it was regen and agrarian separately.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:35):**  And then I was branding, I was playing around and that sort of re-came to me in a sort of  
**[0:18:43-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:43):**  in some moments with some other people.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:45):**  And anyway, we did that.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:48):**  And then I left that brand to those that I was working with.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:52):**  And we needed something that really defined us.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:55):**  And so as you do, I was just on a plane, I think, well, I'm going somewhere and just  
**[0:19:00-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:19:00):**  often where I do that sort of thing.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:19:02):**  And I sketched that, I sketched out some words and I put regenerative and agrarian together.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:19:11):**  And so I got it so regrarian.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:19:16):**  And so it's a regenerative agrarian, basically.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:19:21):**  And that was a big moment for us.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:19:24):**  And then with the platform, we'll use, as I said before, using the Keyline Scale of  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:19:30):**  Permanence in that first training with those holistic management educators, that just,  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:19:35):**  it was a revelation in terms of, well, here's a start and here's a finish.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:19:39):**  And here's a process and being a process person, it just was a fright.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:19:46):**  So I started to look at the Keyline Scale of Permanence more closely.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:19:51):**  By this stage, I was pretty heavily involved with holistic management and I was thinking,  
**[0:19:56-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:19:56):**  well, the Keyline Scale of Permanence is all about, well, the full title of the Keyline  
**[0:20:02-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:20:02):**  Scale of Permanence is it's this Keyline Scale of Permanence of all things agricultural.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:20:08):**  And really, it only dealt with the physical realms of agriculture, like where to put water  
**[0:20:14-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:20:14):**  systems, where to put roads, where to put trees, where to put fences, how to fix your  
**[0:20:21-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:20:21):**  soils, where to put farm buildings.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:20:24):**  And so with that, it wasn't holistic.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:20:29):**  And so I started to think about it a bit more and I went, all right, well, climate.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:20:33):**  And it sort of came to me, well, the climate of the mind, I started to sort of jam or riff  
**[0:20:38-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:20:38):**  climate.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:20:40):**  And I thought, well, the climate of the mind, the climate of the mind.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:20:43):**  And other climate, the way people use the term climate.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:20:48):**  And I thought, well, yeah, the climate of the mind is just as fixed as the climate of  
**[0:20:53-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:20:53):**  our atmosphere or the climate that's climates that we live in and so many other climates.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:02):**  And so that sort of came to me then that holistic management and that other elements, the other  
**[0:21:13-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:13):**  layers of the key line scale of permanence could be adapted to be more holistic.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:20):**  So that I changed, so I changed the emphasis of climate in the scale of permanence from  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:26):**  being just about the climate that you're into, the climate of the people that you're working  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:32):**  with, because I'd always found that, you know, the properties and the places, the projects  
**[0:21:37-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:37):**  were the easy part.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:38):**  I'd always said that, you know, if only the people would get out of the way.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:44):**  And I found that too in my own project.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:47):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:49):**  They're usually the, those are the variables you can't control nearly as much.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:54):**  So it seemed as fixed to me.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:57):**  And so right at the top of the list of things to deal with and in the holistic management,  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:03):**  the first thing you need to create is a holistic context.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:07):**  So you get the, you get the person right and then you deal with the project.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:12):**  And then I looked at land shape, which is number two, and I thought, well, land shape,  
**[0:22:17-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:17):**  only land shape.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:19):**  So it pretty quickly came that I changed that to geography.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:23):**  I kept water as water.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:25):**  Farm trees I changed to forestry because I just, I was trying to be a lot more inclusive.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:30):**  Sure.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:31):**  In the words.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:32):**  In the brains of what you do.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:34):**  So I did a lot of things in my own language and, and languages.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:38):**  So I, so I did that.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:41):**  Went to forestry, kept buildings.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:42):**  I think it was farm buildings.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:43):**  I went to buildings, went from subdivision to fencing, soils, status soils.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:51):**  But then there was no spot in there for economy or marketing and there was nothing about energy.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:57):**  So I put in economy after soils because I felt that in my own life I'd been able to  
**[0:23:05-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:05):**  change my personal, our family's economy much quicker than I could my soil, the soils on  
**[0:23:11-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:11):**  our farms or our clients' farms.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:14):**  Sure.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:15):**  And that was an essential part for the development of the people there as well.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:19):**  Correct.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:20):**  And, and then, and then I thought, well, where does energy go?  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:25):**  And energy, I thought, well, it goes last because, you know, there's nothing as fleeting  
**[0:23:30-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:30):**  as a photon of light.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:32):**  And you know, basically that's what drives this whole planet is the light that comes  
**[0:23:36-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:36):**  in from the sun.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:38):**  So so that was where we started.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:42):**  I called it the Regen10 to start with because I hadn't developed the term agrarians.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:47):**  And then once I'd done that, I thought, well, here's a platform.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:51):**  And so I thought I called it the Regrarian's platform and life really hasn't been the same  
**[0:23:56-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:56):**  since.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:57):**  I'd say it's become an obsession, but it's, you know, we've taught hundreds of courses  
**[0:24:07-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:07):**  now with the Regrarian's platform being at the centrepiece, it's made our life so much  
**[0:24:14-0:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:14):**  easier and it's made our designs a lot richer and a lot more targeted and our work a lot  
**[0:24:22-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:22):**  more targeted.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:23):**  And I think from the feedback I've had of a lot of consultants that we've trained, they've,  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:29):**  it's been a big breath to share to bring that into their working life as well.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:35):**  So yeah, we've been pretty pleased.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:36):**  I think that's fantastic.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:37):**  And that's been one of the main things out of the work that you've done, both in speeches  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:42):**  and videos and other things that I've been able to find because I haven't been able to  
**[0:24:46-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:46):**  take your course in person, that has been really influential in my own work, which is,  
**[0:24:51-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:51):**  you know, very similar to what you do, perhaps with a little bit more of an emphasis on the  
**[0:24:54-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:54):**  building side.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:55):**  But now, so you just gave us the really quick view of those 10 layers that you build in,  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:03):**  the soil layer, forestry layer, building and so on, in even those more abstract ones that  
**[0:25:08-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:08):**  you added on later.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:09):**  Could you explain how your layer system sort of interacts with one another in order to  
**[0:25:14-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:14):**  make a holistic design?  
**[0:25:16-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:16):**  Yeah, that's a great question.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:19):**  We tend to go through with people.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:23):**  So what are you asking?  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:25):**  Like if I get a client, how do I use it to interact with them?  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:29):**  And they're not necessarily with the client, although that's important too, but how all  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:33):**  the different layers interact with one another, either in opposition or in synergy in order  
**[0:25:39-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:39):**  to help the design along sort of become bigger than the sum of its individual parts?  
**[0:25:46-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:47):**  The when I started with it, it wasn't obvious to me because I used it initially as a teaching  
**[0:25:55-0:26:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:55):**  tool to be thorough because I like being thorough and it wasn't immediately obvious.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:26:04):**  And then once I started, because teaching is a really powerful way of sort of thrashing  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:26:09):**  out ideas and getting that immediate feedback and all the rest of it.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:26:13):**  And we've always done design while we're teaching.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:26:17):**  So we've always had an example property or something to focus on.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:26:25):**  And so we'd applied the scale accordingly.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:26:28):**  And it became fairly obvious fairly quickly that by running through with this platform,  
**[0:26:34-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:26:34):**  then you could then in terms of the interactions that would occur, they were largely ones of  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:26:42):**  elimination as much as anything else.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:26:46):**  So for example, if you look at climate like that, you create the holistic context, which  
**[0:26:52-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:26:52):**  is that core rules of the game, if you like, or rules of engagement that you create for  
**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:27:02):**  doing any project and everything bounces off that.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:27:07):**  And with that, once you've defined what your enterprises are going to be and what you want  
**[0:27:13-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:27:13):**  to do and what you don't want to do, then for example, the forestry layer, when you  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:27:19):**  look at that, you go, okay, well, there's certain things that I might have done that  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:27:24):**  I may not do now as far as tree installations are concerned, or there's buildings that I  
**[0:27:29-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:27:29):**  may or may not have done.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:27:32):**  If I look at the geographies, I look at, as I think you might've heard before, I look  
**[0:27:37-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:27:37):**  at climate as being the rules of the game or the rules of engagement and geography is  
**[0:27:44-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:27:44):**  like, and the geography of the place, like where you are, what the landform is like,  
**[0:27:50-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:27:50):**  et cetera, is really the board game.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:27:54):**  So it's the template that you've, it's the palette that you've got to work with.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:27:59):**  I love that as you're looking at things, it definitely simplifies it and helps to understand  
**[0:28:04-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:04):**  sort of how each part interacts with one another.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:08):**  So the game as it were, that I play with my clients and with my students is the interaction  
**[0:28:16-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:16):**  between the context of the humans and the context of the landscape.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:23):**  And of course the climate, the biospheric climate, which is the sort of overriding factor  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:29):**  that determines what you can and can't do.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:33):**  And so it's really a marriage between those.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:35):**  And so when you look at the, what I call the development layers, development management  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:40):**  layers of water, forestry, access, buildings, fencing, soils, et cetera, you know, they're  
**[0:28:46-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:46):**  all development layers.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:48):**  And then you've got economy, which is more of a management layer, and you've got energy,  
**[0:28:53-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:53):**  which is both a management and development layer.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:57):**  You sort of in that initial looking at those at the marriage of the context, you then sort  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:29:04):**  of going through the list and going, no, I don't need this.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:29:07):**  Yeah, I do need that sort of thing.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:29:10):**  And you find yourself then, like if I'm looking at what's the relationship between soils and  
**[0:29:18-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:29:18):**  water.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:29:19):**  Well, if I'm looking at soils, I might be trying to manage better drainage in my soils,  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:29:28):**  or I might be trying to increase the amount of water that's in my soils.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:29:32):**  So you do have that interaction.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:29:36):**  You might look at what's the relationship between buildings and fencing.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:29:41):**  Well, some buildings need fences around them, some don't.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:29:47):**  What type of fencing goes for what type of building?  
**[0:29:51-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:29:51):**  How does fencing relate to access and so on.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:29:55):**  So there's all of those interactions between the layers, some of which will help you to  
**[0:30:02-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:02):**  eliminate things that you might have otherwise done.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:08):**  And some will help you to help, those interactions will help guide what you will actually ultimately  
**[0:30:14-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:14):**  do.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:15):**  I don't know if that completely answers your question.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:18):**  That's fantastic.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:19):**  And now I want to go back and focus a little bit on something that you talked about earlier,  
**[0:30:23-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:23):**  and that's the economic layer.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:24):**  Now I know you focus a lot on the business side of helping clients and students to make  
**[0:30:28-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:28):**  their enterprises profitable, but I found that the persistent idea, especially within  
**[0:30:36-0:30:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:36):**  ecological circles, which is that a company that is for profit can only be destructive.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:43):**  And can you give me a short overview on some of the ways that a business can be both profitable  
**[0:30:48-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:48):**  and regenerative?  
**[0:30:49-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:49):**  Yeah, it's an interesting one.  
**[0:30:51-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:51):**  I saw a note by someone recently who said that people who are sort of trying to work  
**[0:31:01-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:31:01):**  their way through the economic issues and the economic system that we have and their  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:31:07):**  problems with capital.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:31:11):**  And I very much look at capital through the lens of what Ethan Rowland and Gregory Landwey  
**[0:31:19-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:31:19):**  have developed with their eight forms of capital or regenerative capital, in that capital is  
**[0:31:25-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:31:25):**  not just about financial capital, it's also about social capital and natural capital and  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:31:32):**  experiential capital and so on.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:31:37):**  And so when you bring that conversation into the climate discussion as we do, so it's sort  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:31:43):**  of because it's a, you know, when we're having that climate discussion in our platform, we're  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:31:47):**  talking about some fairly heady stuff, if you like, and, you know, the sort of frameworks  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:31:52):**  that we're going to, like, the climate is like the operating system.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:31:57):**  And you know, what's our operating system about?  
**[0:32:01-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:32:01):**  And what are our core ethics?  
**[0:32:05-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:32:05):**  What's important to us?  
**[0:32:06-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:32:06):**  And so with that, we then start a conversation around growth models, no growth models, incentivising  
**[0:32:15-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:32:15):**  workers or labour instead of just paying labour, allowing labour to actually get equity, all  
**[0:32:27-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:32:27):**  of those different ways of doing it, as opposed to just having the classic hierarchical model  
**[0:32:33-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:32:33):**  where you've, which also, you know, for some people works fine, where you've got a husband  
**[0:32:39-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:32:39):**  and wife or core team of owners, and then you've got labour, and there's quite a separation  
**[0:32:46-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:32:46):**  between that.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:32:47):**  I find that in the conversations around in this space that a lot of the conversation  
**[0:32:56-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:32:56):**  is around the lack of community that seems to be built by capitalism.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:33:04):**  And that said, I've worked in a number of businesses of all types, classic hierarchical  
**[0:33:12-0:33:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:33:12):**  types to work around co-ops and all of that sort of thing, that it's really the leadership  
**[0:33:24-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:33:24):**  and those rules of engagement that define whether that's a good workplace and whether  
**[0:33:30-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:33:30):**  people are happy, and whether the landscape becomes happy as a result, the ecology becomes  
**[0:33:37-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:33:37):**  happy as a result.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:33:39):**  And so I don't think there's really any one method, it's really something that has to  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:33:44):**  be self-determined by the players.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:33:49):**  And that's something that can only be done with some inclusivity.  
**[0:33:54-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:33:54):**  And that's why I really like the holistic management, holistic context process, because  
**[0:34:01-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:34:01):**  everyone is a decision maker.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:34:03):**  And if they have their contribution to make and they understand where they are in the  
**[0:34:10-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:34:10):**  decision making process, then happiness is more likely to be achieved.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:34:19):**  And then the business model is the way that we develop the business model around that.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:34:29):**  That's complex because it has the business just started, what levels of debt has it got,  
**[0:34:35-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:34:35):**  so much, how much equity does it have, all of those sorts of things really in some cases  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:34:43):**  tie your hands as far as how different you can be.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:34:47):**  And it also depends on the people involved.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:34:51):**  Some people just like turning up to work.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:34:54):**  And they say that we like it, they don't want to be in business and do all of the stuff  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:34:59):**  that goes with running a business, they just want to turn up.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:04):**  So you really got to ask the people what they want.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:08):**  And that's why I've always been a fan of self-determination and respecting the individual and asking the  
**[0:35:15-0:35:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:15):**  individual, but do that within a holistic whole.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:19):**  If people understand that's the way things generally work, well then things get along  
**[0:35:23-0:35:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:23):**  fine.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:24):**  That's a great perspective there, I really agree with it.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:27):**  And I have also found a lot of those things to be true with the clients that I've worked  
**[0:35:31-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:31):**  with myself.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:34):**  Because if you push way too hard on a regenerative agenda or an environmental agenda without  
**[0:35:41-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:41):**  focusing sufficiently on making sure that the business model is viable, all of your  
**[0:35:46-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:46):**  best intentions are either going to be limited or temporary because you do have to take care  
**[0:35:52-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:52):**  of that, like you said, that holistic management part.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:54):**  And the variables that come in with every single client or every single enterprise are  
**[0:35:59-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:59):**  so unique in each situation that I think it was really valuable that you said you really  
**[0:36:06-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:36:06):**  have to take them on a case by case basis, but there's also many different ways to achieve  
**[0:36:11-0:36:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:36:11):**  positive results, both with a profit and in a way that's good for the land and the environment  
**[0:36:17-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:36:17):**  and the people as well.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:36:20):**  In my book, the book that we're writing, The Climate Chapter, the first section of that  
**[0:36:25-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:36:25):**  book talks about different, what I call regenerative design principles.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:36:30):**  And they're a collection of principles that I've found over the years.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:36:37):**  And a lot of people say in the permaculture movement, they just follow permaculture design  
**[0:36:41-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:36:41):**  principles, which are fine.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:36:44):**  Both Bill Mollison and David Holmgren came up with a list.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:36:49):**  But there's lots of other people out there in this whole in the movement, if you like,  
**[0:36:54-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:36:54):**  who've created their own lists.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:36:56):**  And I started it off actually with my grandparents.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:00):**  My grandfather was a bit of a Bush intellectual.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:05):**  And I remember he said to me once when I was only seven or eight, he said, to profit is  
**[0:37:12-0:37:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:12):**  to steal.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:14):**  And I said, oh, what do you mean by that?  
**[0:37:16-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:16):**  We said, well, you know, he grew up in the 1930s and so he was born in 1915.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:22):**  And so he grew up in the Depression.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:24):**  That was his formulative years.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:26):**  And he really saw what happened when profit really did steal, because you could see that  
**[0:37:35-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:35):**  through the excesses of what caused the Great Depression with the financial markets crashing.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:41):**  And you saw that again in 2008 with the global financial crisis.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:44):**  So it was just pure greed that caused greed with some more creative algorithms that caused  
**[0:37:53-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:53):**  the crash.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:54):**  Right.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:55):**  It's a cult, but it's still the same on the inside.  
**[0:37:57-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:57):**  Exactly.  
**[0:37:58-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:58):**  Exactly.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:59):**  And so I sort of thought about that as I grew up, because he said a number of things to  
**[0:38:03-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:03):**  me.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:04):**  Like another one was, you know, humans are just like yeast.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:08):**  They eat all of the sugar and then they'll die in their own shit.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:13):**  And as a sort of a as a lesson around ecology.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:16):**  And it's all about, you know, taking if you take too much from today, then you'll you'll  
**[0:38:21-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:21):**  be gone for tomorrow.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:23):**  So my work with indigenous people here in Australia, it's a general indigenous principle  
**[0:38:30-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:30):**  that across the nations of Australia that, you know, if you find a bush that's got a  
**[0:38:35-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:35):**  whole lot of fruit on it, then you don't strip the whole tree.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:39):**  Always leave some for the animals and you leave some for the other passerby who's coming  
**[0:38:44-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:44):**  to take what you need and leave it.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:46):**  And that to me is all there.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:48):**  They're all very linked to what profit should be that what profit.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:54):**  If you look at an apple tree, an apple tree is a great example or a cherry tree.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:59):**  Any of those great or an oak or just about any trade is an awesome example of of it giving  
**[0:39:08-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:08):**  the profit of its interaction with the soil and with the sky and the minerals that flow  
**[0:39:16-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:16):**  through that species and that it's giving off.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:20):**  Why does a tree give off 500 pounds of apples?  
**[0:39:24-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:24):**  I mean, what's the sense in that?  
**[0:39:27-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:27):**  What's what's the benefit to the tree?  
**[0:39:30-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:30):**  That's that's that tree's profit.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:33):**  And it's up to us to to then, you know, take that on and go, OK, well, how can we be the  
**[0:39:40-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:40):**  apple tree in what we do?  
**[0:39:42-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:42):**  How can we be that cherry or that acorn?  
**[0:39:45-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:45):**  And also, you know, I think it was Ethan Roland who said he had a company called Apple Seed  
**[0:39:51-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:51):**  Permaculture.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:52):**  He said something like, well, how many apples come from one apple seed?  
**[0:39:59-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:59):**  And it's again, you know, you've got this this power in life, which is exponential and  
**[0:40:06-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:40:06):**  incredible and the ultimate compound interest.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:40:11):**  And I really get excited by that.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:40:14):**  And so, you know, so profit doesn't have to be the dirty word that my grandfather saw.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:40:20):**  It can actually be just like climate and a whole lot of other words that we use.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:40:25):**  They thought of quite powerfully across a whole range of domains.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:40:29):**  And and that's that's what I try and bring to this, that that, you know, it doesn't have  
**[0:40:36-0:40:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:40:36):**  to be just one way.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:40:37):**  You can you can be a profitable nonprofit.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:40:42):**  You can and you should be, because otherwise you'll be bound to your benefactors, bound  
**[0:40:49-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:40:49):**  to your patrons, to your grant cycle.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:40:56):**  That you should always be trying to have your system get better and use these great examples  
**[0:41:06-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:06):**  that nature has given us.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:08):**  I think that's a very powerful analogy that you've that you've used there.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:13):**  And I wholeheartedly agree.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:15):**  Now I wanted to touch on something that you mentioned a little while back and frankly  
**[0:41:19-0:41:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:19):**  is one of my favorite things about the work that you do, which is you promote an idea  
**[0:41:23-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:23):**  of working with a full deck, meaning that you sample from all the best ideas from many  
**[0:41:28-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:28):**  different innovators around the world.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:30):**  Obviously, you mentioned permaculture as one of them.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:33):**  But Alan Savory's work with dryland restoration or Paul's statements with fungi and bioremediation,  
**[0:41:39-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:39):**  transition communities, effluent cleanup with plants and waterways, and the list goes on  
**[0:41:44-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:44):**  and on.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:46):**  Why has it been so important to you to constantly broaden the toolbox that you use for your  
**[0:41:51-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:51):**  work and not to be too focused on any one practice?  
**[0:41:57-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:57):**  Well I think when you do the personality assessment, I've been classified as an innovator.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:42:06):**  So I have that personality type that I don't know that all innovators are the same.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:42:15):**  Some innovators I suppose would be those that are just, if you're an electrical innovator,  
**[0:42:20-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:42:20):**  then you wouldn't necessarily be looking at biology for your electrical innovation that's  
**[0:42:28-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:42:28):**  still to come, although some would through biomimicry, for example.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:42:32):**  But for me, I've always had a very broad interest.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:42:39):**  I started reading when I was three.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:42:43):**  My parents gave me a, I think I was about five or six, they bought me the world book  
**[0:42:50-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:42:50):**  encyclopedia and so that was my first book, twenty-six volumes or whatever it was.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:43:01):**  So my interests have always been really wide and so it seems only natural when you're working  
**[0:43:10-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:43:10):**  in this trade that you would not be stuck in one methodological box and I think people  
**[0:43:22-0:43:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:43:22):**  like P.A.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:43:23):**  Yeomans, when I read him, I didn't come across permaculture straight away.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:43:30):**  I think while I was still working in hospitality, I was doing a lot of reading on ecological  
**[0:43:37-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:43:37):**  agriculture so I read, I think I read Masanobu Fukuoka's One Straw Revolution first.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:43:44):**  That's a classic, yes.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:43:45):**  It's a great book.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:43:46):**  It gets a lot of people started.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:43:47):**  Yeah, I was about eighteen or nineteen and he was quite broad in his influence.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:43:57):**  He talked about being a microbiologist and he talked about different influences to things  
**[0:44:03-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:44:03):**  and he ultimately travelled when you read his other books, which I did.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:44:09):**  I read Yeomans pretty early and P.A.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:44:12):**  Yeomans said, you know, he looked at soil, he looked at the principles of soil conservation  
**[0:44:18-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:44:18):**  from the Army Corps of Engineers in the US and he looked at Louis Bromfield's work and  
**[0:44:24-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:44:24):**  he looked at a lot of the other people of the nineteen forties and fifties who were  
**[0:44:31-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:44:31):**  the pioneers of the organic agriculture movement.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:44:38):**  And so I looked at, you know, you sort of look to people who influence you I suppose  
**[0:44:42-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:44:42):**  and so, well, you know, how did they get by?  
**[0:44:44-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:44:44):**  What were some of their intellectual stimuli and of course then coming along with Bill  
**[0:44:50-0:44:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:44:50):**  Mollison and, you know, it was fairly clear, especially when I met Bill and to an extent  
**[0:44:55-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:44:55):**  David, that even they, their interests were quite broad, you know, they were looking at  
**[0:45:03-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:45:03):**  all of these different people and what they were doing.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:45:06):**  I suppose though with the exception being that in permaculture, and I won't say this  
**[0:45:12-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:45:12):**  is always the case, but permaculture becomes an appropriation society where everything  
**[0:45:20-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:45:20):**  becomes permaculture even though it wasn't developed with, you know, what I call something  
**[0:45:25-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:45:25):**  as being permaculture is where permaculture ethics and design principles have been used  
**[0:45:32-0:45:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:45:32):**  in the formation of an idea or a concept.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:45:37):**  Whereas if I go and take Paul Stamets work and I call that permaculture, well that to  
**[0:45:44-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:45:44):**  me is appropriation.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:45:45):**  Or if I take Alan Savory's work and I put that in and I call that permaculture, that  
**[0:45:51-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:45:51):**  to me is appropriation.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:45:52):**  So it's a bit disingenuous to go down that pathway and it's a movement that's been fairly  
**[0:45:59-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:45:59):**  strong on doing that as I've observed from working within it and looking outside of it.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:46:05):**  So yeah, just having that, just realising that no single person or no single methodology  
**[0:46:14-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:46:14):**  has all of the answers that you really got to look at as Kirk Gadzia I think came up  
**[0:46:21-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:46:21):**  with the term, you know, playing with a full deck.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:46:24):**  Don't discount anything.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:46:25):**  There's going to be, and it goes through to my attitude with people as well.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:46:30):**  I mean, I've got mates who are billion, literally billionaires and I've got mates who earn $20,000  
**[0:46:38-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:46:38):**  a year who are cleaners and they all, everyone has something to contribute.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:46:42):**  If you're a good person and you're alive, you're observing things and you're making  
**[0:46:52-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:46:52):**  those observations and you're sharing them.  
**[0:46:54-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:46:54):**  So there's something, someone's got something, everyone's got something to contribute therefore.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:46:59):**  Which I think is what it really comes down to.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:03):**  That's a very important way to look at that.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:04):**  I completely agree.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:05):**  Now up until this point we've mostly talked about some of the theories and the ideas that  
**[0:47:11-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:11):**  you've either fostered or have adopted yourself.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:15):**  But let me switch to a little, a bit of a different approach and talk about a really  
**[0:47:21-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:21):**  important and practical question that's essential to almost any landscape restoration project  
**[0:47:27-0:47:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:27):**  and that's soil building.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:29):**  So I've heard you mention in the past that the fastest way to create soil is with grass.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:34):**  Now this seems counterintuitive to many people who put a lot of effort into mulching and  
**[0:47:38-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:38):**  composting.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:39):**  So can you explain how this works and what elements are needed to build soil on a large  
**[0:47:43-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:43):**  scale?  
**[0:47:44-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:45):**  Yeah so I think that, so if I look at the three examples that you've just given me,  
**[0:47:55-0:48:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:55):**  I look at grass because if I just go and put mulch on the ground and I solely do that,  
**[0:48:03-0:48:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:48:03):**  then I look at well what's the mineral cycle, what's the effect of the mineral cycle on  
**[0:48:12-0:48:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:48:12):**  that, what's the effect of the water cycle on that and what's the effect of the energy  
**[0:48:16-0:48:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:48:16):**  cycle on that.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:48:19):**  So the ecosystem processes as described by Alan Savory in Holistic Management.  
**[0:48:25-0:48:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:48:25):**  So when we look at the water cycle, water will come from rain or if it comes by rain  
**[0:48:32-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:48:32):**  it will be, its fall will be softened by the application of mulch and infiltration will  
**[0:48:39-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:48:39):**  be more likely as opposed to runoff if rainfall hits a litter layer which is basically what  
**[0:48:47-0:48:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:48:47):**  mulch is, a thick litter layer and somewhat unnaturally thick in a lot of cases.  
**[0:48:55-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:48:55):**  And then you have, well what's the mineral cycle?  
**[0:48:57-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:48:57):**  Well part of it, a lot of that mulch is exposed to sunlight and the oxygen in the air so a  
**[0:49:05-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:49:05):**  lot of it's going to oxidise and return into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, the rust  
**[0:49:12-0:49:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:49:12):**  of carbon and some of it which is in contact with the soil, if there's adequate moisture  
**[0:49:18-0:49:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:49:18):**  in the soil will be broken down biologically and the minerals will be cycled into the biology  
**[0:49:24-0:49:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:49:24):**  of the soil, some of which will be labile, therefore some of the organisms, in fact a  
**[0:49:31-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:49:31):**  lot of those organisms will be aerobic organisms so they'll exhale the carbon that they consume  
**[0:49:39-0:49:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:49:39):**  in part as carbon dioxide, some of that carbon will go into their bodies and into the creation  
**[0:49:46-0:49:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:49:46):**  of their manures and all their byproducts, their secretions etc. which will have varying  
**[0:49:53-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:49:53):**  levels of degradation time, therefore re-entry back into the atmosphere in that form of carbon  
**[0:50:03-0:50:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:50:03):**  and other minerals.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:50:05):**  Then we look at the energy cycle, well the energy cycle, the sunlight's coming down and  
**[0:50:13-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:50:13):**  it's burning this stuff up so it's enhancing the speed of the mineral cycle so is it sustainable  
**[0:50:24-0:50:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:50:24):**  therefore to apply mulch?  
**[0:50:29-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:50:29):**  Well mulch is an inert, relatively inert material that is going to be decomposed by something,  
**[0:50:40-0:50:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:50:40):**  it has value but if I just go and put mulch down that's not going to do everything, it  
**[0:50:48-0:50:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:50:48):**  will build a little bit of soil where you get the soil contact but a lot of that's going  
**[0:50:55-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:50:55):**  to be extinguished if I just left a pile of mulch on and I come back in five years time  
**[0:51:00-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:51:00):**  in a lot of places I'll go back to bare soil.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:51:05):**  Like if I'm where you are in Guatemala where it's in the tropics, subtropics, tropics,  
**[0:51:11-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:51:11):**  if I put three inches of straw mulch on the ground it would probably not be there in six  
**[0:51:21-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:51:21):**  to eight months depending on the time of year and I'd come back and that soil would be bare  
**[0:51:26-0:51:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:51:26):**  again just because of the sunlight being so strong and the number of organisms who would  
**[0:51:32-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:51:32):**  consume it.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:51:34):**  Then the soil gets bare and then it gets exposed and then you lose what you've just gained.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:51:40):**  The other example that you gave was compost.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:51:45):**  Well compost is somewhat similar, if I just apply that topically which is what a lot of  
**[0:51:50-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:51:50):**  people do then unless I have a plant community which is going to drive the energy flow of  
**[0:52:00-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:52:00):**  all of the organisms that are within that plant community to get it into the ground  
**[0:52:07-0:52:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:52:07):**  then it's the same as mulch, it'll just literally oxidise and ultimately go away.  
**[0:52:15-0:52:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:52:15):**  So mulch and compost are supportive elements to soil building but ultimately soil building  
**[0:52:22-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:52:22):**  happens because of photosynthesis and the byproducts of photosynthesis so you can't  
**[0:52:32-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:52:32):**  do soil building without and you can't sustain soil building, you might be able to do it  
**[0:52:38-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:52:38):**  in the short term but you can't sustain it without plants and what you need to also look  
**[0:52:44-0:52:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:52:44):**  at is alright well if I'm on a landscape let's look at plants, let's look at woody plants  
**[0:52:50-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:52:50):**  and let's look at non-woody plants.  
**[0:52:54-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:52:54):**  Most woody plants don't have very fibrous root systems and most of them have, you know  
**[0:53:01-0:53:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:53:01):**  if you go and clear a landscape of woody plants then the amount of the depth of soil that's  
**[0:53:08-0:53:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:53:08):**  been created is generally fairly shallow and that's because in woody plant ecosystems  
**[0:53:17-0:53:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:53:17):**  the primary soil biological partners are fungal and fungi are aerobic and so the carbon that's  
**[0:53:27-0:53:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:53:27):**  cycled through woody plant ecologies when they get to a state of homeostasis they become  
**[0:53:35-0:53:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:53:35):**  the amount of carbon that's cycled is basically homeostatic, you have carbon come in and carbon  
**[0:53:41-0:53:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:53:41):**  go out and with a bit being put behind and you know if you look at a woody plant ecology  
**[0:53:49-0:53:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:53:49):**  any woody plant, 50% thereabouts is carbon and then the rest that's contributed is cycled  
**[0:53:59-0:54:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:53:59):**  by predominantly aerobic organisms in particular fungi because they're the organisms that can  
**[0:54:05-0:54:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:54:05):**  cycle the woody matter more easily than bacteria can.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:54:10):**  So then we look at grasses as a type of non-woody plant and grasses of particularly perennial  
**[0:54:19-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:54:19):**  grasses have got really really fibrous root systems and relatively deep and their main  
**[0:54:26-0:54:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:54:26):**  way of cycling carbon is not cycling it into their bodies but cycling it out as exudates  
**[0:54:36-0:54:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:54:36):**  so woody plants have exudates too, they still function like all plants do where they make  
**[0:54:42-0:54:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:54:42):**  polysaccharides as a byproduct of photosynthesis and they exude some of those substances out  
**[0:54:48-0:54:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:54:48):**  through as secretions through their roots and so on and soil microlife then uses that  
**[0:54:56-0:55:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:54:56):**  as a smoothie, as a high energy smoothie and off it goes, it's the energy that drives the  
**[0:55:03-0:55:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:55:03):**  processes of the micro life in the soil so it's just that grasses have a lot more of  
**[0:55:10-0:55:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:55:10):**  that and they're not putting that carbon that they would into woody tissue and that's why  
**[0:55:16-0:55:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:55:16):**  you know when you look at Eric Toensmeyer's The Carbon Farming Solution which is a great  
**[0:55:21-0:55:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:55:21):**  piece as a starting piece I think because we've still got a lot to learn here that a  
**[0:55:28-0:55:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:55:28):**  lot of his effort is focused on agroforestry and as a known to be reliable means of storing  
**[0:55:36-0:55:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:55:36):**  carbon in woody plant tissue, that's no arguments there, what's not really well known and understood  
**[0:55:45-0:55:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:55:45):**  is just how much grassy plant or non-woody plant exudation contributes to the amount  
**[0:55:59-0:56:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:55:59):**  of carbon that is being stored and how that can be a contributor to climate change and  
**[0:56:08-0:56:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:56:08):**  it's because when you look at some of the tables that Eric's looking at in terms of  
**[0:56:12-0:56:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:56:12):**  research there's no research, there's been hardly any research at all by comparison with  
**[0:56:18-0:56:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:56:18):**  what there has been with woody plant systems. I think that's largely because woody plant  
**[0:56:24-0:56:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:56:24):**  systems are really easy to or relatively easy to measure because you can just use forestry  
**[0:56:31-0:56:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:56:31):**  measurement techniques to determine the amount biomass in a stand and then more or less half  
**[0:56:36-0:56:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:56:36):**  that and that'll tell you how much carbon is sequestered into that stand of woody biomass  
**[0:56:41-0:56:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:56:41):**  that's easy, foresters have been doing that forever. Whereas how do you measure soil carbon  
**[0:56:50-0:56:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:56:50):**  that's been put down to 1 metre and 2 metres of depth by non-woody plant tissue root systems  
**[0:56:58-0:57:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:56:58):**  that's a harder call and there's just been very little which Eric has acknowledged in  
**[0:57:02-0:57:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:57:02):**  some of his tables, single research projects done on that. So we don't know very much on  
**[0:57:09-0:57:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:57:09):**  that but what I do know through my work is that when I've engaged with grasses through  
**[0:57:19-0:57:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:57:19):**  processes I can't say that I've sequestered more carbon because I haven't measured it.  
**[0:57:24-0:57:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:57:24):**  I'm not going to stand up here and say that I've done that but what I have noticed is  
**[0:57:29-0:57:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:57:29):**  that the internal drainage characteristics of that soil have changed, the pidelity, so  
**[0:57:36-0:57:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:57:36):**  the amount of soil aggregation has changed so that I've got more peds, the soil has developed  
**[0:57:44-0:57:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:57:44):**  better structure. What I can also say is that the soil colour has changed and that the root  
**[0:57:50-0:57:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:57:50):**  depth of the grasses and other plants that I'm working with in those systems has increased.  
**[0:57:58-0:58:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:57:58):**  Now again I'm not going to say that the soil carbon levels have changed because I haven't  
**[0:58:02-0:58:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:58:02):**  tested it and I'm not a scientist so I'm not going to stand up and say that but what  
**[0:58:07-0:58:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:58:07):**  I have noticed there are a whole host of other changes which have led to that soil being  
**[0:58:15-0:58:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:58:15):**  more productive.  
**[0:58:16-0:58:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:58:16):**  Sure you've noticed some other very powerful indicators that would give you cause to believe  
**[0:58:21-0:58:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:58:21):**  that things are moving in the correct direction.  
**[0:58:23-0:58:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:58:23):**  Correct and I've seen that repeatedly in a range of different climates on a range  
**[0:58:28-0:58:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:58:28):**  of different parent materials, different geologies, soil types across the world. And with that  
**[0:58:39-0:58:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:58:39):**  I've also read a really great book years ago called Vegetation and Soils by S.J. Ayer  
**[0:58:48-0:58:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:58:48):**  who was an English geography teacher and he looked at the relationship between plant communities  
**[0:58:55-0:59:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:58:55):**  and soils. And I was talking on a webinar the other day about this. We did a recs in  
**[0:59:02-0:59:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:59:02):**  Chile a couple of, last year and it was on some volcanic alluvium, one thousand year  
**[0:59:07-0:59:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:59:07):**  old volcanic alluvium. There's a big volcanic lake up in the Andes and every thousand years  
**[0:59:13-0:59:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:59:13):**  its wall breaches and all of the material in that wall comes down and becomes the new  
**[0:59:19-0:59:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:59:19):**  layer of alluvium on the plane. You couldn't get a better situation, it's like a volcanic  
**[0:59:26-0:59:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:59:26):**  sandbox of basically rock dust. So it's really beautiful stuff.  
**[0:59:32-0:59:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:59:32):**  A big mineral injection into the soils there.  
**[0:59:35-0:59:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:59:35):**  But completely homogeneous, right? There's no stratification to the profile, there's  
**[0:59:42-0:59:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:59:42):**  a sameness to this. So you couldn't get a better large scale area on which to look at  
**[0:59:52-1:00:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:59:52):**  the influence that vegetation communities have on soil formation. And within about a  
**[1:00:02-1:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:00:02):**  three hundred metre area, quarter of mile area, there were four different vegetation  
**[1:00:08-1:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:00:08):**  communities. There was a eucalyptus globulus forest, blue gum forest, there was an oak  
**[1:00:14-1:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:00:14):**  forest with an understory of blackberry, there was a pinus radiata or monterey pine forest  
**[1:00:22-1:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:00:22):**  and there was a perennial grassland. And with our training we went and had a look at, we  
**[1:00:29-1:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:00:29):**  dug the soil of each. Now remember a thousand years ago this was, there was nothing there,  
**[1:00:37-1:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:00:37):**  it was just a sandbox, right? And so now these different vegetation communities have been  
**[1:00:42-1:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:00:42):**  established with their different ways of interacting with the mineral cycle, with different suites  
**[1:00:49-1:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:00:49):**  of organisms and different energy efficiencies. So the eucalyptus forest, we're going to have  
**[1:00:57-1:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:00:57):**  a look at it. The soil is thick with litter from all of the branches and leaves of the  
**[1:01:04-1:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:01:04):**  eucalyptus trees. And you dig down and you've got a minor little layer of saprophytic fungi  
**[1:01:14-1:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:01:14):**  activity and then the soil is bone dry and structureless and compacted. Now if I go and  
**[1:01:21-1:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:01:21):**  push one of those trees over, the root systems are strong but they're small relative to what's  
**[1:01:29-1:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:01:29):**  above the tree, what's above the ground. Most of the biomass in that organism is above ground,  
**[1:01:37-1:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:01:37):**  it's in the trunk.  
**[1:01:38-1:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:01:38):**  Sure, it doesn't have the balances you would see in other places.  
**[1:01:44-1:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:01:44):**  No. And the roots are not fibrous, they're very, they're large and there's not very many  
**[1:01:50-1:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:01:50):**  of them but the soil is bone dry and there's no soil building. It's all saprophytic fungi  
**[1:01:55-1:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:01:55):**  just doing the turnover into the atmosphere. Then I go to the pine forest, more or less  
**[1:02:00-1:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:02:00):**  the same, very heavy litter of pine needles, bit of saprophytic activity, bit of bacterial  
**[1:02:06-1:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:02:06):**  activity as you can see. Dig down, a little bit more humus, what you might call humus,  
**[1:02:14-1:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:02:14):**  a bit more darkening or an A horizon. But then again you get down to about 10, 15 centimetres,  
**[1:02:22-1:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:02:22):**  bone dry, no soil structure being created, yeah no life.  
**[1:02:28-1:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:02:28):**  Go to the oak forest with its understory of blackberry. Oaks are a bit wider spacing,  
**[1:02:34-1:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:02:34):**  they're deciduous. Blackberries which are really woody plant, primary woody plant, primary  
**[1:02:40-1:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:02:40):**  successional woody plant. A few other plants on the ground story. Dig down, soil is moist,  
**[1:02:48-1:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:02:48):**  it's humid, obviously more bacterial activity because of the, of just the crumb structure  
**[1:02:59-1:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:02:59):**  of the soil and a bit deeper but then you get down and then there's a very clear stratification.  
**[1:03:05-1:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:03:05):**  We go from a strong O horizon which is the organic layer, very strong A horizon which  
**[1:03:12-1:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:03:12):**  is that humid and living soil, topsoil you might call it and then it's B horizon and  
**[1:03:20-1:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:03:20):**  it's just stark. Now we go up to the grassland. The grasses are not a well managed grass community  
**[1:03:27-1:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:03:27):**  so it's overgrazed so the roots are kept short because the top is kept short and but the  
**[1:03:37-1:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:03:37):**  crumb structure and the depth of that soil even though the amount of biomass above the  
**[1:03:43-1:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:03:43):**  ground is, you know we're talking about six inches versus a hundred feet, the soils in  
**[1:03:52-1:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:03:52):**  that grassland were about twice as deep. That is the living soil in that grassland was twice  
**[1:03:58-1:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:03:58):**  as deep. Even though that organism is, what's a hundred, six inches versus a hundred feet,  
**[1:04:08-1:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:04:08):**  half a foot, it's a two hundred times less above ground biomass just in terms of height  
**[1:04:16-1:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:04:16):**  and if you look at in terms of quantity, I don't even know how to, that would take a  
**[1:04:21-1:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:04:21):**  bit more to work out but you see what I mean? So that was a really great and powerful example  
**[1:04:26-1:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:04:26):**  for our group and for me after having read Ayer's book in the influence of root physiology  
**[1:04:36-1:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:04:36):**  and the way that plants manage the outcomes of photosynthesis to the way that soils are  
**[1:04:48-1:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:04:48):**  visibly formed or not. I'll just put it in that way that they're visibly formed because  
**[1:04:53-1:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:04:53):**  I know that there's people out there who get a bit cranky about the lack of science in  
**[1:05:00-1:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:05:00):**  this but you know I asked them to get out and have a bit of a look themselves.  
**[1:05:05-1:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:05:05):**  Sure and there's a lot of other ways of measuring progress and seeing how things are developing  
**[1:05:10-1:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:05:10):**  without taking a microscope to it and the traditional analytics of the scientific world.  
**[1:05:16-1:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:05:16):**  It makes it a lot more approachable for people who have their own land projects to actually  
**[1:05:20-1:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:05:20):**  contribute to the research that way.  
**[1:05:24-1:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:05:24):**  Yeah and that's not to say that like you find where you are, like if you're in the tropics  
**[1:05:29-1:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:05:29):**  you know what's appropriate and that's what a lot of people are looking at like they'll  
**[1:05:33-1:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:05:33):**  say well you know what people would do as people want to do is they'll hear from someone  
**[1:05:39-1:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:05:39):**  like me a leader in all of this and they'll say oh he says grass is the best way to go  
**[1:05:44-1:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:05:44):**  or they'll listen to a savory and yeah he says grass is the best way to go but what  
**[1:05:48-1:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:05:48):**  they're not actually doing is looking inside the story and saying okay well not looking  
**[1:05:54-1:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:05:54):**  at the again that marriage between contexts that marriage between the climate that you  
**[1:06:00-1:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:06:00):**  live in the climate of you and the enterprise that you have and the climate of your geography  
**[1:06:05-1:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:06:05):**  right and putting all of those things together.  
**[1:06:10-1:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:06:10):**  Now if I'm in where you are in Central America it's tropical blah blah blah blah blah I'm  
**[1:06:17-1:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:06:17):**  not going to go and recommend to everybody that they go and set up a grassland and that's  
**[1:06:23-1:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:06:23):**  going to be the end game but you may well use some non woody plants green manures and  
**[1:06:30-1:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:06:30):**  other non woody species to get your soil shifted from where it is now and it's horribly abused  
**[1:06:37-1:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:06:37):**  condition over to a condition where it can accept woody biomass and foster the development  
**[1:06:44-1:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:06:44):**  of woody biomass more effectively so we use it as a means to an end not just as the means  
**[1:06:54-1:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:06:54):**  that becomes the end.  
**[1:06:57-1:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:06:57):**  You've got to actually be a lot broader than that and don't just take things that people  
**[1:07:02-1:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:07:02):**  take in isolation because that's what people do unfortunately.  
**[1:07:07-1:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:07:07):**  I think that's been the big takeaway of everything we've talked about so far today.  
**[1:07:12-1:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:07:12):**  Yeah be thorough, just be thorough.  
**[1:07:15-1:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:07:15):**  Now once people are able to actually build their soils what are some of the essential  
**[1:07:19-1:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:07:19):**  things that you recommend to keep it from roting away again and to continue to have  
**[1:07:24-1:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:07:24):**  it build up on its own, make it a regenerative system?  
**[1:07:29-1:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:07:29):**  Well if I look at the context of say in the tropics for example let's say you're trying  
**[1:07:34-1:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:07:34):**  to develop an agroforestry system well then building plant communities and managing those  
**[1:07:40-1:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:07:40):**  plant communities so that you always contribute back to the soil surface and you have as much  
**[1:07:52-1:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:07:52):**  biological decomposition of any plant byproducts, what I mean by that are leaves and branches,  
**[1:08:05-1:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:08:05):**  that you have as much biological decomposition of that as possible whether that's true animals,  
**[1:08:10-1:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:08:10):**  or whether that's true soil like you know you might take branches.  
**[1:08:15-1:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:08:15):**  So you've got a branch of a tree you feed that to the goats because you want milk and  
**[1:08:19-1:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:08:19):**  meat from the goats right well then what do you do with the manure and the urine from  
**[1:08:24-1:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:08:24):**  the goats well that material now should go back to where it came from I mean that's the  
**[1:08:28-1:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:08:28):**  ideal cycle or that you feed those goats in a where you do the feeding of those branches  
**[1:08:35-1:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:08:35):**  and leaves to those goats that the goats I don't always stay in the same place they rotate  
**[1:08:41-1:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:08:41):**  around so that the those minerals that are cycled through the goat get cycled across  
**[1:08:47-1:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:08:47):**  the board but that you also try and maintain a hundred percent ground cover a hundred percent  
**[1:08:53-1:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:08:53):**  of the time with either the residues of plants or plants themselves such that the soil is  
**[1:09:01-1:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:09:01):**  protected and organic material on the soil whether it's living or non-living is the skin  
**[1:09:14-1:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:09:14):**  of the soil of the main mineral part of the soil so if you take that away then it becomes  
**[1:09:22-1:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:09:22):**  horribly exposed and if you're in the tropics that's even more enhanced because you've got  
**[1:09:28-1:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:09:28):**  warm corrosive rainfall and erosive rainfall and you've got really really strong sunlight  
**[1:09:35-1:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:09:35):**  so so you really want to make sure that that skin is not exposed because if it is you're  
**[1:09:42-1:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:09:42):**  going to lose things really quickly so having adequate levels of shade of the soil surface  
**[1:09:48-1:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:09:48):**  by managing implant communities from your non-woodies right up to your woodies is really  
**[1:09:54-1:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:09:54):**  important and then when you're out in the areas which are more range type country where  
**[1:09:58-1:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:09:58):**  your trees woody plants are more of a less density a lesser density and you are looking  
**[1:10:06-1:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:10:06):**  at management of grasses and whatnot it's basically the same principles try and promote  
**[1:10:13-1:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:10:13):**  the the the bio mimicked rotation of animals through using a planned grazing regime and  
**[1:10:24-1:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:10:24):**  try and maintain a permanent cover of of the soil with lit with the litter of the plants  
**[1:10:31-1:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:10:31):**  you're growing and the plants themselves and and that's that's basically what you have  
**[1:10:37-1:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:10:37):**  to do the rest of it will take care of itself which is which is a great thing I mean it's  
**[1:10:44-1:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:10:44):**  planets that's what you want that's what you're trying to work towards so that's our inputs  
**[1:10:48-1:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:10:48):**  are no longer necessary for the this is regenerate and develop itself yeah it just becomes management  
**[1:10:56-1:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:10:56):**  and you know unfortunately we've stuffed up so many ecologies by taking apex predators  
**[1:11:03-1:11:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:11:03):**  out of the system is and you know destroying so many large herds not hurting animals and  
**[1:11:14-1:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:11:14):**  their predators we've taken those out of the system we fenced we've rode it you know we've  
**[1:11:20-1:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:11:20):**  done all sorts of stuff to this planet I mean we you know there's never been a more powerful  
**[1:11:24-1:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:11:24):**  species than us and and so you know we've got it we've you can't just say well we'll  
**[1:11:33-1:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:11:33):**  just leave it alone we've actually you know to an extent you can do that in the humid  
**[1:11:38-1:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:11:38):**  tropics because it will take care of itself because of the the provenance of humidity  
**[1:11:46-1:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:11:46):**  because it has a potential to to regenerate much faster because of the resources that  
**[1:11:50-1:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:11:50):**  are constantly being put in the system yeah exactly because of water it's just humidity  
**[1:11:54-1:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:11:54):**  it's as Savory puts it's a non-brittle landscape so if you're in a non-brittle which also happens  
**[1:12:02-1:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:12:02):**  in the cooler climates as well then you can just walk away and nature will take care of  
**[1:12:06-1:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:12:06):**  itself but if you're in those areas where you're sub-humid so-called brittle landscapes  
**[1:12:12-1:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:12:12):**  will you will just by by walking away and not not being involved in management then  
**[1:12:20-1:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:12:20):**  you will get desertification so yeah people say oh well you get all these you get all  
**[1:12:26-1:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:12:26):**  these woody plants appear and you know it seems like there's a lot going on but go and  
**[1:12:31-1:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:12:31):**  look at the soil surface is there any soil actually being formed in those systems and  
**[1:12:35-1:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:12:35):**  the answer is generally no it's not what are the rates of runoff this you know look at  
**[1:12:41-1:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:12:41):**  look at the levels of groundwater that's in those systems where there's there's takeover  
**[1:12:46-1:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:12:46):**  by often spiny low low high toxicity woody plant systems you know there's very little  
**[1:12:58-1:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:12:58):**  soil cover a lot of these systems are quite fire prone and for or pyrophilic so they and  
**[1:13:05-1:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:13:05):**  on it goes so now I think we do need to interact and I think it's part of our responsibility  
**[1:13:13-1:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:13:13):**  following all of the degradation that we've caused.  
**[1:13:17-1:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:13:17):**  There you have it so tell me now what are some resources that you recommend to people  
**[1:13:22-1:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:13:22):**  who want to learn more about this either about land-based projects or any other form of regenerative  
**[1:13:26-1:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:13:26):**  development?  
**[1:13:27-1:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:13:27):**  Well I'll speak selfishly we with the Regrarians Limited non-profit we were about to launch  
**[1:13:35-1:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:13:35):**  a whole range of different online trainings which people will be able to hear about in  
**[1:13:41-1:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:13:41):**  the coming weeks so keep an eye out on that at our Facebook presence at Regrarians Facebook  
**[1:13:48-1:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:13:48):**  page or on the Regrarians.org website become a subscriber and you'll find out more about  
**[1:13:56-1:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:13:56):**  that so we'll be taking people through whole programs online just as an aside when we came  
**[1:14:05-1:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:14:05):**  back from last year's tour we Lisa and myself took on the full-time caring position of Lisa's  
**[1:14:12-1:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:14:12):**  94 year old mother the grandfather and grandmother of our children so we live in a house and  
**[1:14:17-1:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:14:17):**  we're her carer so my touring days is such a I've been put on hold as well we we had  
**[1:14:25-1:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:14:25):**  to take that.  
**[1:14:26-1:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:14:26):**  That's understandable sure.  
**[1:14:27-1:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:14:27):**  Yeah which is great and when we it's it's actually refreshing to not be on tour all  
**[1:14:31-1:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:14:31):**  the time so but we still we still need to get our energy flowing and so online training  
**[1:14:37-1:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:14:37):**  is something that we'll be doing to help people with that.  
**[1:14:40-1:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:14:40):**  Really?  
**[1:14:41-1:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:14:41):**  Yeah which is we're really looking forward to and we've worked hard on planning otherwise  
**[1:14:47-1:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:14:47):**  the Regrarians Handbook which is under development that's that's a sort of I would say it's a  
**[1:14:54-1:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:14:54):**  place where a lot of these concepts are brought together but then otherwise look at holistic  
**[1:15:00-1:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:15:00):**  management and the work that the Savory Institute and also holistic management international  
**[1:15:07-1:15:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:15:07):**  I'd look at Regeneration International they're a really great organization who have a base  
**[1:15:11-1:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:15:11):**  in Mexico and elsewhere but particularly out of Mexico and Alex and whole team of people  
**[1:15:17-1:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:15:17):**  there doing a great job I'd also look at the permaculture movement more broadly there's  
**[1:15:23-1:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:15:23):**  people there who are doing really great work particularly people like Eric Olson at the  
**[1:15:29-1:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:15:29):**  permaculture skills center that those guys are stellar operators there's a few others  
**[1:15:35-1:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:15:35):**  about who I should mention that I can't remember off the top of my head.  
**[1:15:39-1:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:15:39):**  No worries if it comes to you just let me know send me an email or something all of  
**[1:15:44-1:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:15:44):**  these links that you're talking about now I'll put up in the show notes for everyone  
**[1:15:47-1:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:15:47):**  to find easily.  
**[1:15:48-1:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:15:48):**  There's an unprecedented amount of information I think that's a part of the burden that people  
**[1:15:52-1:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:15:52):**  have is you know how do I pull all of this together and we we think that the regrarian's  
**[1:16:00-1:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:16:00):**  platform is a really good clearinghouse for that in that at least it gives everything  
**[1:16:05-1:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:16:05):**  a title.  
**[1:16:08-1:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:16:08):**  So I look at the regrarians like I use the regrarians platform to catalog my books it's  
**[1:16:13-1:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:16:13):**  my Dewey system on my library it's how I it's how I file all of my files now so it gives  
**[1:16:22-1:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:16:22):**  things a place and it also gives things of priority so I think Mr. Yeomans did us all  
**[1:16:28-1:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:16:28):**  a great service with the development of the keyline scale of permanence of all things  
**[1:16:33-1:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:16:33):**  agricultural and I'd highly recommend people have a read of his works and yeah and listen  
**[1:16:39-1:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:16:39):**  to podcast podcast thing is fantastic.  
**[1:16:42-1:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:16:42):**  You know I if I'm not listening to the to ABC radio when I'm driving around places I  
**[1:16:50-1:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:16:50):**  put on podcasts and listen to the likes of yourself Oliver and a whole host of other  
**[1:16:55-1:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:16:55):**  people and just take in what's going on and give yourself the time realize that there  
**[1:17:00-1:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:17:00):**  probably is enough time and that you owe it to yourselves and your families and the ecosystems  
**[1:17:07-1:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:17:07):**  that you manage to take the right amount of time to to put more emphasis on the management  
**[1:17:15-1:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:17:15):**  of those systems than the development because you can spend an awful amount of energy and  
**[1:17:20-1:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:17:20):**  investment on developing things without focusing on on something that's really important and  
**[1:17:25-1:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:17:25):**  that's their management.  
**[1:17:27-1:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:17:27):**  I'm so glad you said that something I really like to try and put focus on as well usually  
**[1:17:32-1:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:17:32):**  the development is the really sexy part and people often lose interest or don't have the  
**[1:17:36-1:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:17:36):**  staying power to keep those systems maintained but that's really where they make the shift  
**[1:17:42-1:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:17:42):**  after you know usually the first couple of years of development and maintenance that  
**[1:17:46-1:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:17:46):**  they start to work on their own and really start to turn a corner where the outputs are  
**[1:17:51-1:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:17:51):**  much much greater than the inputs.  
**[1:17:54-1:18:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:17:54):**  Yeah and where you shift we shift your regime of innovation so you shift from being an innovator  
**[1:18:00-1:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:00):**  in installation to an innovator of the outputs of that of that installation.  
**[1:18:06-1:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:06):**  So true.  
**[1:18:08-1:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:08):**  Yeah and we I came up with a thing last year just in riffing that we that we have that  
**[1:18:15-1:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:15):**  most people are engaged in what we call big M management and not and small D sorry big  
**[1:18:21-1:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:21):**  D development and small M management when actually what we should be doing is how is  
**[1:18:28-1:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:28):**  we should have a big M management approach and a small D development and I think a lot  
**[1:18:33-1:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:33):**  of people would find value in following that.  
**[1:18:37-1:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:37):**  Absolutely.  
**[1:18:38-1:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:38):**  Well hey Darren thank you so much for taking the time today and sharing those resources  
**[1:18:42-1:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:42):**  with us.  
**[1:18:43-1:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:43):**  I really hope that we can do a follow up with this sometime I know I have a ton more questions  
**[1:18:47-1:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:47):**  that I'd love to ask you at some point.  
**[1:18:49-1:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:49):**  Your work has been a real influence on what I do and so many of my friends as well were  
**[1:18:53-1:18:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:53):**  very excited that I had the opportunity to speak to you.  
**[1:18:55-1:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:55):**  So again thank you for your time.  
**[1:18:57-1:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:57):**  That's really nice and it's lovely to hear those tones of Mother's Day in your village  
**[1:19:04-1:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:04):**  in Guatemala in the background.  
**[1:19:06-1:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:06):**  That's lovely the fireworks stayed away.  
**[1:19:08-1:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:08):**  We were fortunate with that right.  
**[1:19:11-1:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:11):**  The music stayed at least nice enough that we could continue with the interview.  
**[1:19:15-1:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:15):**  It's nice to have a little bang.  
**[1:19:17-1:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:17):**  It added some flavor right.  
**[1:19:19-1:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:19):**  Yeah there you go.  
**[1:19:21-1:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:21):**  All right well thank you so much and thanks for your really great questions.  
**[1:19:23-1:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:23):**  It has been my pleasure thanks for making the time.  
**[1:19:26-1:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:26):**  Take care Darren.  
**[1:19:27-1:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:27):**  All right all the best.  
**[1:19:29-1:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:29):**  There you have it.  
**[1:19:30-1:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:30):**  Now I know that was a marathon talk but let's jump right into this session's weekly tip.  
**[1:19:35-1:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:35):**  Now I know this was a point that both Darren and I made earlier in the talk but it's important  
**[1:19:38-1:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:38):**  enough that I wanted to repeat it and explain a little more in this section.  
**[1:19:43-1:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:43):**  Of course I'm talking about maintenance.  
**[1:19:45-1:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:45):**  Everyone gets really excited and enthusiastic about the design process and implementation  
**[1:19:50-1:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:50):**  of a new project because that's when you get to do all the dreaming.  
**[1:19:54-1:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:54):**  That's the part when you can envision this grand future for how you're going to create  
**[1:19:57-1:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:57):**  an epic landscape and produce tons of food and house all sorts of wildlife all while  
**[1:20:02-1:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:02):**  building tons of soil and all that really good stuff.  
**[1:20:07-1:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:07):**  Now there's nothing at all wrong with that.  
**[1:20:08-1:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:08):**  I love this part of the project as much as anyone.  
**[1:20:11-1:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:11):**  But here's where I offer a little caution and forethought.  
**[1:20:15-1:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:15):**  During this process make sure that you plan for maintenance.  
**[1:20:19-1:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:19):**  Plan for maintaining all the systems and features that you put in.  
**[1:20:23-1:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:23):**  The truth is that having an annual garden or raising animals is incredibly rewarding  
**[1:20:28-1:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:28):**  but it requires a lot of consistent input.  
**[1:20:31-1:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:31):**  Now these are the less sexy parts of having a regenerative lifestyle, especially in the  
**[1:20:35-1:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:35):**  first few years when your ecosystem is still young and getting established and hasn't yet  
**[1:20:40-1:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:40):**  reached the point where it can take much care of itself yet.  
**[1:20:43-1:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:43):**  Just remember that this is a lifestyle choice and there are some compromises that come along  
**[1:20:47-1:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:47):**  with that.  
**[1:20:48-1:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:48):**  If you commit to having a mini farm or growing a lot of plants in your house, you're going  
**[1:20:52-1:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:52):**  to need to care for them regularly.  
**[1:20:54-1:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:54):**  Many people find that it's hard to travel or be away from home for more than a day and  
**[1:20:59-1:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:59):**  sometimes not even that long if you don't have someone who can come around and take  
**[1:21:03-1:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:03):**  care of your systems for you.  
**[1:21:05-1:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:05):**  Now this isn't meant to be discouraging at all, just as a way of helping all of you get  
**[1:21:10-1:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:10):**  the most realistic idea of the lifestyle that you're creating and there are a lot of ways  
**[1:21:15-1:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:15):**  to make this process more manageable and simple to maintain.  
**[1:21:19-1:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:19):**  One of the easiest ways is to schedule regular tasks ahead of time in your calendar.  
**[1:21:25-1:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:25):**  Things like garden harvesting times, crop rotation and planting, even tool maintenance  
**[1:21:30-1:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:30):**  is much more likely to get done if you take the time to make a schedule at the beginning  
**[1:21:34-1:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:34):**  of the season so that you're not always worried if you've forgotten the tasks that don't happen  
**[1:21:39-1:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:39):**  on a regular or daily basis, but that are important to making your design work.  
**[1:21:44-1:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:44):**  I personally like using Google Calendar because I can set it up so that it sends me alerts  
**[1:21:49-1:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:49):**  in advance and that way I can prepare for what's coming up ahead of time.  
**[1:21:53-1:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:53):**  So once you get settled into your maintenance routines, these things will become automatic  
**[1:21:57-1:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:57):**  and they'll get easier and easier.  
**[1:21:59-1:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:59):**  Just remember that developing a truly regenerative home and life is a long-term project and it  
**[1:22:04-1:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:22:04):**  takes all the little unseen steps along the way to achieve those beautiful after pictures  
**[1:22:09-1:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:22:09):**  that seduce us into getting started in the first place.  
**[1:22:13-1:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:22:13):**  Now for those of you who want to make a giant leap forward in your natural building education,  
**[1:22:18-1:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:22:18):**  I'm now offering natural building workshops that cover everything you need to know to  
**[1:22:21-1:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:22:21):**  get started on your own house in an intensive one-week experience.  
**[1:22:26-1:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:22:26):**  You'll get the chance to mix cob, make adobes, work with stones, natural plasters, and even  
**[1:22:31-1:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:22:31):**  try out bamboo joinery and much more.  
**[1:22:34-1:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:22:34):**  We'll go over design essentials and project planning, all while working on hands-on projects

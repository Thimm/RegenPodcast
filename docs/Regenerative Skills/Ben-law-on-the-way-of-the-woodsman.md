### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 01 Jul 2022 06:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:00:00):**  This is Regenerative Skills, the podcast helping you to learn the skills and solutions to create  
**[0:00:08-0:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:00:08):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:00:10):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:00:13):**  I don't know about you, but even though there's unlimited information available online, I  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:00:19):**  tend to learn best by doing things and actually getting my hands dirty.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:00:23):**  If you're interested in making the leap from screens to the land, then I've got some exciting  
**[0:00:27-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:00:27):**  learning events for you.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:00:29):**  I'm going to be teaching two of my favorite subjects this upcoming autumn at the Green  
**[0:00:33-0:00:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:00:33):**  Rebel Farm in beautiful Miravet, Spain.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:00:36):**  The first course is a weekend intensive on regenerative agroforestry, designed for people  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:00:41):**  who want to try their hands at a range of different tree planting and orchard maintenance  
**[0:00:45-0:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:00:45):**  skills.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:00:46):**  We'll cover the whole range from reading a landscape and propagating plants, to planning  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:00:50):**  a planting project, getting trees in the ground, maintaining a growing system, and even pruning  
**[0:00:55-0:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:00:55):**  a grown forest.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:00:56):**  The best part is that all of these are based on activities to advance a real farm.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:01:01):**  The second event is a 5-day deep dive into the regenerative design process, again with  
**[0:01:06-0:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:01:06):**  a focus on agroforestry.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:01:08):**  This course is designed for people who are either considering buying land, or who are  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:01:12):**  at the early stages of developing a site and want to ensure that they get off on a profitable  
**[0:01:16-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:01:16):**  regenerative trajectory.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:01:18):**  We'll work through the scale of permanence, learning to gather essential information about  
**[0:01:22-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:01:22):**  the landscape, vegetation, and soil.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:01:25):**  From there, we'll work through hydrological capture and restoration, planning for productive  
**[0:01:29-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:01:29):**  planting and reforestation, business considerations, soil health regeneration, and much more.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:01:36):**  All of this too will be taught through hands-on activities so you leave not only knowing how  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:01:40):**  to develop an effective and profitable design, but also with experience with the work and  
**[0:01:45-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:01:45):**  skills required to get things done.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:01:48):**  This weekend agroforestry intensive will be from Friday the 16th through Sunday the 18th  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:01:52):**  of September, and the design workshop goes from Tuesday the 11th to Sunday the 16th of  
**[0:01:57-0:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:01:57):**  October.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:01:58):**  So don't start your project with digital learning alone, come and get your hands dirty  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:02:02):**  with inspiring, like-minded people and level up your skills this autumn.

**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:02:13):**  Early bird discounts are now open, so don't hesitate, and I'll see you in the orchards  
**[0:02:17-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:02:17):**  soon!  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:02:19):**  Welcome back everybody to a special episode edition of this ongoing series focusing on  
**[0:02:24-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:02:24):**  tree planting and agroforestry.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:02:27):**  Often when we think about agroforestry, we think first about food.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:02:31):**  Orchards and fruit and nut crops are certainly an important aspect of agroforestry, but so  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:02:35):**  is the responsible harvesting and care of woodlands for building materials and fuel.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:02:41):**  For a long time I have admired the work of Ben Law, who is a woodsman, permaculture practitioner,  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:02:46):**  and author of many books on developing, tending, and using the products that come from the  
**[0:02:51-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:02:51):**  woods.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:02:52):**  Ben is a wealth of practical knowledge and is a founding member of the Forest Stewardship  
**[0:02:56-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:02:56):**  Council.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:02:57):**  He's also worked for Oxfam as a permaculture consultant.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:03:01):**  He's also the author of The Woodland Way, A Permaculture Approach to Sustainable Woodland  
**[0:03:06-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:03:06):**  Management.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:03:07):**  Now, Ben's woodland house has also been featured on The World's Greenest Homes, a  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:03:11):**  series of the Discovery Channel's Planet Green, and his latest book, Roundwood Timber  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:03:16):**  Framing, is a full-color guide to his beautiful and traditional building techniques.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:03:21):**  This is a special episode today because it comes from the archives of one of my favorite  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:03:25):**  podcasts, one that has helped to inspire me to begin my own show back in the early days.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:03:30):**  Since I can hardly hope to improve on my friend Scott Mann's exceptional interviewing style  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:03:35):**  in the Permaculture podcast, I reached out to him to ask if he would allow me to rebroadcast  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:03:39):**  his interview with Ben, and he generously said yes.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:03:43):**  Scott and I, along with our friend and colleague Jill Cloutier from Sustainable World Radio,  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:03:48):**  have teamed up to form the Regenerative Media Alliance, which is a union of independent  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:03:52):**  media producers working to broadcast regenerative solutions around the world.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:03:57):**  Be sure to stick around until the end where I'll share some more information about this  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:04:01):**  alliance and I'll give you the early sign-up information for the RMA's Professional Development  
**[0:04:05-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:04:05):**  Conference.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:04:07):**  In this interview, Ben and Scott discuss a wide range of woodland management ideas and  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:04:12):**  options like coppicing and palarting.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:04:15):**  Ben describes some of the valuable skills and products that can be central to profitable  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:04:19):**  forest management and forest-based businesses.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:04:22):**  Overall, I just really love this conversation for the mindset that comes through from Ben  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:04:27):**  as he describes his deep relationship with the woodland that he stewards, and I really  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:04:31):**  hope that this helps you to look at the forest in a deeper way as well.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:04:35):**  So with all of that out of the way, I am very pleased to hand things over to Scott Mann  
**[0:04:39-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:04:39):**  and Ben Law.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:04:42):**  If you could give myself and the listeners a bit of your biography and background, how  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:04:46):**  you came to do what you're doing and then we'll take the conversation from there.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:04:51):**  Okay.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:04:52):**  How I came to be doing what I'm doing really goes back to the 1980s, middle of the 80s  
**[0:04:59-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:04:59):**  and I was living in a small village close by to where I'm in my woods now and I was  
**[0:05:07-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:05:07):**  involved in sort of conservation landscaping, sort of doing ponds, wildflower meadows, that  
**[0:05:14-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:05:14):**  type of thing and getting these leaflets for the letterbox talking about areas the size  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:05:21):**  of Belgium in the Amazon rainforest being destroyed every day.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:05:25):**  And I just couldn't really comprehend that something of that scale could be going on.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:05:31):**  So I guess rather naively at the time, I kind of went out there feeling I could do something  
**[0:05:36-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:05:36):**  about that.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:05:38):**  And I traveled to South America, different parts of the Amazon rainforest at the end  
**[0:05:44-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:05:44):**  of the 1980s.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:05:46):**  And although I saw some pretty awful forestry destruction, I also met some amazing people  
**[0:05:53-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:05:53):**  out there who had such in-depth knowledge of the forest that it kind of made me see  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:06:01):**  what I tend to refer to now as the pattern of the forest dweller which is a different  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:06:07):**  approach to managing woods and forests certainly that we have in the UK.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:06:12):**  So I came back to England with this sort of understanding and desire to try and put in  
**[0:06:19-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:06:19):**  place some of those patterns I'd learned.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:06:21):**  These are patterns of long-term stewardship of one particular piece of land so sort of  
**[0:06:28-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:06:28):**  a real understanding of where the migratory species when they come in to the forest, where  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:06:35):**  you're likely to find fungi, medicinal herbs, different methods for growing food in the  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:06:40):**  forest, harvesting timber, making your own structures from it.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:06:44):**  And so I came back really with that as my focus and the last 25 years has been sort  
**[0:06:52-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:06:52):**  of revolved around that.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:06:54):**  When I recently sat down and read the latest edition of the Woodland Way, your revised  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:06:59):**  and updated version, you addressed permaculture in that.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:07:03):**  Where did you encounter permaculture and how did that become part of your practice?  
**[0:07:08-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:07:08):**  Okay.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:07:09):**  Permaculture, I encountered first through the visionary series.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:07:15):**  We had a television series over here which there was a number of different visionaries  
**[0:07:22-0:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:07:22):**  outlining their sort of views on the planet, people like Manfred Maxnice and Bill Mollison.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:07:30):**  And Bill gave this piece called, In Grave Danger of Falling Food and I saw that and  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:07:36):**  it kind of clicked to me that there was a real message there and I look more into permaculture  
**[0:07:42-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:07:42):**  and having been involved over the years with different types of sort of land-based practices.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:07:50):**  I mean I trained originally as a shepherd, I've worked on fruit farms, sort of horticulture  
**[0:07:57-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:07:57):**  and broad-scale farming.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:07:59):**  And what was lovely was permaculture kind of sort of removed all of those sort of tags  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:08:04):**  of particular disciplines and looked at land as one, well more than land but at the time  
**[0:08:10-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:08:10):**  I was focused mainly on land as one sort of overall system that we can then design and  
**[0:08:17-0:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:08:17):**  work with.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:08:18):**  And so I was inspired and I fairly soon after that did a permaculture course here in the  
**[0:08:23-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:08:23):**  UK and I think it was the second course that was held in the UK, so quite a while ago now.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:08:30):**  And that was very eye-opening, opened up a lot of thought for me and kind of helped weave  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:08:40):**  into the ideas I already had for what I wanted to do in the woodlands back here.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:08:45):**  So yes, very key moments in my life finding permaculture and doing that design course.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:08:54):**  One of the things that I liked about your book and this is one of the pieces that I  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:08:57):**  want to talk to when I do a longer review about it and I will say that the only thing  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:09:01):**  that I've read of yours other than some of the material on the web that I found was The  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:09:05):**  Woodland Way.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:09:08):**  But I found though that as a permaculture book, I think that it's more about what the  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:09:13):**  permaculture community needs in the literature and the material because it speaks to me as  
**[0:09:19-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:09:19):**  such an authentic and honest work because this is what you're embodying and doing.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:09:27):**  When I spoke with David Holmgren, a lot of what he suggested was that the community needs  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:09:32):**  to connect people with what their personal calling is and then have them adapt permaculture  
**[0:09:38-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:09:38):**  to that work rather than trying to fill the same niches over and over again.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:09:45):**  And I really have to admit that because of where I live in the eastern woodlands of Pennsylvania  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:09:51):**  after reading your book and interacting with some other people I know who are doing woodland  
**[0:09:56-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:09:56):**  management and foraging like tending to zone 4, that one of the niches that I would like  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:10:02):**  to personally explore is that idea of becoming a woodsman in the area where I live.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:10:07):**  Right, okay.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:10:09):**  And I just liked it because permaculture seemed like a very important part of the book but  
**[0:10:15-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:10:15):**  it wasn't what you were focusing on, that it was taking those ideas and applying it  
**[0:10:18-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:10:18):**  to what you do.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:10:19):**  Yeah, I'd say that is very much the approach.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:10:25):**  What is kind of unique really I guess in the situation I'm in is that I'm dealing with  
**[0:10:31-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:10:31):**  woodlands that have such a long-term history of management and that management has been  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:10:38):**  sort of kind of although partly there's been years when it's been missed out, the skills  
**[0:10:44-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:10:44):**  and traditions and the craft work that goes with managing in particular caucus woodlands  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:10:51):**  is kind of already a fantastic permaculture system in its own right.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:10:56):**  So for me it's more being a matter of tweaking that and bringing more of the human element  
**[0:11:01-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:11:01):**  in and looking more at the diversity, one of the products that one can make which are  
**[0:11:08-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:11:08):**  coming out of the woodland but also engaging more with the improving biodiversity side  
**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:11:16):**  of it which maybe has always been seen as a byproduct of woodland management rather  
**[0:11:21-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:11:21):**  than actually focusing and designing that into how one works.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:11:27):**  And part of that that's of deep interest to me is one of the questions that I get is how  
**[0:11:31-0:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:11:31):**  can we use permaculture to make a living and your material really expands on the idea of  
**[0:11:42-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:11:42):**  not just primary but also the secondary and tertiary products that someone could develop  
**[0:11:46-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:11:46):**  from woodland management and have multiple if you will price points at which to interact  
**[0:11:53-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:11:53):**  with their community in order to make a living that it's not just well I'm going to create  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:11:57):**  poles for this and just do this, this and this that with the round wood structures you  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:12:02):**  can build and the idea of certain materials you can weave into fence panels, others you  
**[0:12:07-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:12:07):**  can split for rails for building fences.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:12:10):**  It's pretty incredible this diversity that you're developing.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:12:13):**  Yes, no, totally.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:12:15):**  And I guess what's exciting about it is that there's always something new every year.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:12:19):**  I like the idea of although there's particular products that I make from the wood which are  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:12:26):**  either traditional or I have good regular markets from, so there's always something  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:12:30):**  new that springs up and there's something new maybe I've been making for a while that  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:12:35):**  one year doesn't prove so popular and I can go back to that in a few years time meanwhile  
**[0:12:40-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:12:40):**  we'll make something else.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:12:41):**  So I guess I have focused very much on the materials for the useful in buildings and  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:12:48):**  materials are useful in sort of garden and farm use.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:12:51):**  But alongside that, I do get specialist requests from local people who want just something  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:12:59):**  unusual made of wood, the other day had a request for a chicken house and we made that  
**[0:13:04-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:13:04):**  and made a shingle roof for it and the person we made it for is a chicken breeder and they  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:13:12):**  put it up on their website and now they've come back and said, ''Can you make a lot more  
**[0:13:16-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:13:16):**  of them?''  
**[0:13:17-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:13:17):**  And suddenly something like that out of nowhere will come and we can adapt with the type of  
**[0:13:24-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:13:24):**  woods we've got to being quite versatile in what we make.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:13:27):**  That idea of making a chicken house, one of the things that I have on my list to make  
**[0:13:32-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:13:32):**  is a top bar beehive.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:13:34):**  Okay, yeah.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:13:35):**  Now I'm thinking about the the coppice, I'm turning some of my property into some coppice  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:13:43):**  stools now that's not right is it?  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:13:46):**  Well you could be turning it into basically turning into woodland that you're managing  
**[0:13:52-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:13:52):**  as a coppice system.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:13:54):**  I mean maybe I should explain coppice system, would that be useful?  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:13:59):**  Yes, if you could because the techniques I think are very easy to understand and that's  
**[0:14:04-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:14:04):**  where I in trying to frame my next piece that I got kind of caught up on but it's creating  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:14:10):**  this small woodland on my own property thinking about how I could use round wood and coppice  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:14:15):**  material to create top bar beehives rather than buying lumber was where my thought was  
**[0:14:20-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:14:20):**  going with it.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:14:21):**  But yes, if you could explain that, it'll be a great refresher for me and the listeners.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:14:26):**  Yeah, no for sure.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:14:27):**  I mean coppicing is a process that certainly over here in England we know has been going  
**[0:14:33-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:14:33):**  on for a few thousand years but the basic process is with broadleaf woodland, deciduous  
**[0:14:40-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:14:40):**  woodland, we go in during the winter season when the leaves have fallen off and the sap  
**[0:14:47-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:14:47):**  is sort of gone back down because it's colder and we cut the trees during that dormant period  
**[0:14:54-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:14:54):**  so just purely over those winter months.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:14:57):**  And then when spring comes rather than the tree having died off, it's like a heavy pruning,  
**[0:15:03-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:15:03):**  the sap rises and new shoots come out.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:15:06):**  Now those new shoots, we then grow on as a multi-stem tree until they reach a particular  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:15:13):**  size that we need to make a particular product from.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:15:18):**  So for making some of the fences, we allow them to grow on for 5 to 7 years and then  
**[0:15:24-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:15:24):**  cut again.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:15:25):**  For making a building, we might let them grow on for 30 years but there's a whole system  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:15:30):**  of these woodlands throughout the UK and there are in different parts of the world as well  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:15:36):**  as some different parts of Europe, there's some in Japan and I know there are a few people  
**[0:15:41-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:15:41):**  working with it in the States as well.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:15:44):**  So this system basically gives you a renewable supply of poles of a particular size and the  
**[0:15:50-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:15:50):**  real beauty of it to me is that this is a process where the human element is so important  
**[0:15:57-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:15:57):**  in the management of the woodland.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:15:59):**  For example, I have night jars that come into my woodlands.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:16:03):**  Now these night jars, they're migratory species.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:16:06):**  They come in from Africa every year and nest in the same woodland.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:16:10):**  Now they will only nest in freshly cut areas.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:16:13):**  So if I stop cutting the coppice, the woodland will grow up into higher forest and the night  
**[0:16:20-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:16:20):**  jar will have nowhere to come to.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:16:22):**  The same applies to a lot of varieties of butterflies and a real varied amount of ground  
**[0:16:27-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:16:27):**  flora plants that are established with this pattern that's kind of like a patchwork of  
**[0:16:33-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:16:33):**  opening up a small area, letting in the light and that grows on and you open up another  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:16:38):**  area.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:16:40):**  And I say this process is one where humans are positive in the system.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:16:45):**  It's quite hard to look at designing systems where the human element is actually a really  
**[0:16:50-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:16:50):**  needed part to increase biodiversity.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:16:53):**  The real benefit then from the system is the by-product, is the timber that comes out when  
**[0:16:58-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:16:58):**  you coppice.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:16:59):**  From that, we then make this sort of range of different products which can be as versatile  
**[0:17:05-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:17:05):**  as one is as a craftsman to convert the round wood into the finished product.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:17:11):**  Some of the oldest woods in the UK, we got like Bradfield Woods and Suffolk is one and  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:17:16):**  there's records of that of monks going back a thousand years ago coppicing that particular  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:17:21):**  woodland and it's still being coppiced today.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:17:25):**  The beauty is that as the years have gone by, the biodiversity has just increased and  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:17:31):**  increased to a recent survey on that woodland showed that it had more ground cover plants  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:17:36):**  in that woodland than they could find in any other woodland across the UK.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:17:41):**  Just an amazing system and there's also a wonderful social side of being a woodsman  
**[0:17:49-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:17:49):**  that's gone with it over generations of people learning particular skills from particular  
**[0:17:57-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:17:57):**  size poles that they've then passed on and it's kind of that side of it as well is a  
**[0:18:03-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:18:03):**  real interest to me.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:18:06):**  That's very helpful.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:18:09):**  I'd like to talk about some of that social side but before we move to that, I was wondering  
**[0:18:16-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:18:16):**  about this coppicing and it being such an old system.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:18:23):**  As you are coppicing, do the stools that you're creating eventually die out?  
**[0:18:27-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:18:27):**  When you say that this one area has been coppiced for a thousand years, are those the same root  
**[0:18:33-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:18:33):**  systems over a thousand years or is that this space has been replanted and managed in different  
**[0:18:40-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:18:40):**  ways for that time?  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:18:42):**  Some of the root systems are the original ones.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:18:46):**  What tends to happen in this particular woodland I'm mentioning in Bradford Woods is a lot  
**[0:18:50-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:18:50):**  of hazel ash and things like the ash trees, basically as you coppice each time, what happens  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:19:00):**  is the new growth comes to the outside where the sap would be on the tree and the middle  
**[0:19:05-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:19:05):**  part eventually begins to rot away.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:19:08):**  What actually happens is you create this outer ring and as it gets bigger over so many hundred  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:19:14):**  years, this outer ring gets wider and wider.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:19:18):**  Then what will happen is a new tree will seed in the middle of that ring and start growing  
**[0:19:22-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:19:22):**  again but the existing tree can spread out over a big area across five, six meters at  
**[0:19:29-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:19:29):**  a time.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:19:30):**  There's been a little bit of work done as well testing, found a very old coppice lime  
**[0:19:38-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:19:38):**  area in a particular parkland and they've actually done tests to trace the genetic origin  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:19:46):**  of it and found out that it is actually all one tree and that they reckon is a couple  
**[0:19:50-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:19:50):**  of thousand years old.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:19:52):**  It seems like where woodlands are coppiced, the trees tend to live longer than if they're  
**[0:19:58-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:19:58):**  just left to grow as a standard tree.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:20:01):**  Amazing systems.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:20:03):**  I think of a tree that I have, a Norway maple that I was looking to try to reinvigorate  
**[0:20:10-0:20:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:20:10):**  because it was not doing so well.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:20:13):**  One of my friends who has a background in forestry, his recommendation was to go through  
**[0:20:17-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:20:17):**  and to prune it heavily to remove about 30% of the limbs that were there to try to force  
**[0:20:23-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:20:23):**  that kind of a growth.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:20:25):**  Now regretfully, that tree has started to split at one of the crotches from the trunk  
**[0:20:30-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:20:30):**  that goes up.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:20:31):**  The trunk has like seven main liters coming off of it at about six feet off the ground  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:20:36):**  but that's starting to split so I'm probably going to wind up dropping that tree at this  
**[0:20:40-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:20:40):**  point but looking at these different ways that pruning and trimming forces this kind  
**[0:20:47-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:20:47):**  of youth and vigor into our trees.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:20:50):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:20:51):**  Yes, that is the basis of what coppicing is doing and certainly the coppice that's kept  
**[0:20:56-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:20:56):**  on what we call a shorter rotation, in other words, the poles are grown for five to 10  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:21:03):**  years, tends to be a lot more vigorous and healthy than the coppice which has grown on  
**[0:21:08-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:21:08):**  a 30, 40, 50-year cycle.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:21:11):**  On that 30, 40, 50-year cycle, can you get furniture grade lumber from that kind of a  
**[0:21:17-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:21:17):**  rotation?  
**[0:21:19-0:21:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:21:19):**  There certainly will be amongst it.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:21:21):**  I mean it's very much having a diversity of products because you always get something  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:21:27):**  that comes out which is a furniture grade timber and then you'll get other timber that's  
**[0:21:32-0:21:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:21:32):**  not so good.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:21:34):**  You've got to find uses for all of that and therefore, one tends to find that you create  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:21:41):**  markets, you create styles of furniture that reflect the materials that are coming out  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:21:47):**  of the woods, it's kind of designing from what the wood is giving you rather than trying  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:21:51):**  to force the design of a particular piece of furniture you want to make onto the wood.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:21:56):**  The saying we have here is, don't make a table out of a bit of wood that doesn't want to  
**[0:22:01-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:22:01):**  be a table, make something else from it.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:22:04):**  It's kind of working with the wood and rather than trying to sort of always force our ideas  
**[0:22:11-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:22:11):**  upon it.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:22:12):**  I mean I think one thing to me as a woodsman is when I walk around the woods, I can see  
**[0:22:16-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:22:16):**  what's growing in the trees before I sell them and that's by the shapes, by the patterns  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:22:22):**  I can work out and quite often there's four or five different products coming out of one  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:22:27):**  stem of tree but you've got to be able to recognize which bits to use for which.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:22:33):**  It reminds me of a question that I received at a live workshop.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:22:38):**  Someone asked me, well now that you practice permaculture, how has it changed your life?  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:22:42):**  Like how do you really apply this in your life and my response was, I no longer try  
**[0:22:46-0:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:22:46):**  to conform the world around me to my goals, I conform my goals to what I can get from  
**[0:22:52-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:22:52):**  the world around me.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:22:54):**  And it seems kind of esoteric way to look at it but I'm not inflicting or imposing what  
**[0:22:59-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:22:59):**  I'm doing on the world rather but trying to find a way that what I do works within it.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:23:05):**  Yes, no absolutely.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:23:08):**  That makes total sense.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:23:10):**  Time scale is one of the beauties I get out of working in the woods.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:23:15):**  I walk around the woods with people and they're asking me things and generally, I'm talking  
**[0:23:19-0:23:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:23:19):**  in 30 years, 50 years, sometimes 100 years and I often get saying to me, you're thinking  
**[0:23:28-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:23:28):**  such large time scales but I think when you work with trees, you do think in very long  
**[0:23:32-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:23:32):**  time scales because obviously, the lifespan and times of trees is far more than our lifetime  
**[0:23:38-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:23:38):**  and span and therefore, you kind of are able to sort of see ahead.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:23:45):**  I guess for me, the woods I've got here, it's kind of like I've inherited sort of hundreds  
**[0:23:50-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:23:50):**  of years of previous woodsman's work.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:23:53):**  My time here in the woods is almost like a sort of flutter of a leaf.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:23:59):**  All I'm doing is trying to improve the biodiversity, get the woods back and up together so they're  
**[0:24:05-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:24:05):**  better for the next generation.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:24:08):**  And when you're working in that way, you're working in time scales that don't, there's  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:24:13):**  no sort of six-month contract you've got to reach.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:24:17):**  It is all very much looking at the landscape in a very, very long picture and I think doing  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:24:23):**  that is a really healthy way of kind of training your mind to be able to think long-term and  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:24:29):**  think about future generations rather than just dealing with the here and now.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:24:35):**  So I'm relatively new to permaculture relative to practitioners such as yourself and others.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:24:42):**  I've only really been doing this in a deeply meaningful way since 2010.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:24:48):**  The more that I practice permaculture, the more that my perspective is multi-generational  
**[0:24:54-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:24:54):**  and intergenerational.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:24:55):**  I think it speaks to some of the things that you were saying and it makes it hard when  
**[0:25:00-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:25:00):**  someone asks a question, well how do you do this, a lot of times the questions are over  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:25:05):**  a growing season or up until a particular plant will bear food.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:25:10):**  And I'm thinking of my grandchildren 30 or 40 years from now, stepping back away from  
**[0:25:16-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:25:16):**  that long view and interacting with that short perspective can be difficult sometimes.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:25:25):**  The other question that I wanted to ask you about the physical side of things before we  
**[0:25:28-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:25:28):**  move to the social, when it comes to the tools that you're using, in the woodland way you  
**[0:25:35-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:25:35):**  mentioned using a battery-powered chainsaw.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:25:38):**  Could you speak some to that chainsaw and some of the other tools you're using?  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:25:42):**  As I look to make this transition if you will to being a novice woodsman in the eastern  
**[0:25:47-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:25:47):**  woodlands, I'm looking to add some additional tools to my toolbox and wondering about some  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:25:54):**  things you'd recommend.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:25:57):**  For sure, I mean the battery chainsaw is new technology and it's at an early stage but  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:26:06):**  like most things with sort of battery technology at the moment, they're constantly improving.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:26:11):**  And as I live off-grid here, I rely predominantly on solar and a little bit on wind for my power  
**[0:26:19-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:26:19):**  supply here.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:26:21):**  Having a battery saw that I can recharge off the solar and then go out and do my cutting  
**[0:26:27-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:26:27):**  is obviously a huge step forward from using fossil fuels.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:26:32):**  It's also so much more pleasant from a noise point of view, from a health point of view.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:26:36):**  So yeah, I'm really quite excited by the new battery technology coming in.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:26:41):**  Now these tools are not good enough to go out and cut big trees with but certainly for  
**[0:26:46-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:26:46):**  the small diameter copies, they're fine.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:26:49):**  And I think in a few years time, we'll have ones which will cope with bigger trees and  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:26:54):**  that will be great for all of us out in the woods.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:26:58):**  With bigger trees, there are traditional hand crosscut saws which are very effective.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:27:05):**  Again like the selling any tree, it's very much getting your cuts right which is the  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:27:09):**  critical part whether you're using a chainsaw or a hand saw to do that.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:27:14):**  The crosscut saws are very, very good.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:27:16):**  Beyond that, the other main tools I tend to use here is the bill huckle, the handbill  
**[0:27:21-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:27:21):**  which is again, I guess a very British tool.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:27:25):**  It's kind of like a little sort of cross between I suppose a mini scythe and an axe.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:27:33):**  It's like a curved blade and over the years, there's been hundreds of different models  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:27:38):**  developed all for different sort of purposes in the countryside.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:27:42):**  And for coppicing, certainly the shorter rotation coppice, the coppice is often cut with the  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:27:49):**  bill hook but we certainly use it for snetting up that means taking off all the side branches  
**[0:27:54-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:27:54):**  and shaping up the timber.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:27:57):**  And it's a beautiful tool to use and spend a fair bit of time getting them good and sharp  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:28:02):**  and by the end of a sort of coppicing season, it's kind of become an extension of your arm  
**[0:28:07-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:28:07):**  almost.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:28:08):**  We use them for so many different things.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:28:11):**  Other tools, I use a lot of things like throws and adzes.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:28:14):**  A throw is kind of like a piece of metal sort of sharpened with a handle on it to make it  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:28:22):**  like an L shape and we use those for splitting because we tend to split a lot of wood rather  
**[0:28:27-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:28:27):**  than saw it because the splitting process, the prides, the fibers apart rather than saw  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:28:33):**  through them and it gives you a much stronger piece of wood at the end.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:28:37):**  So we use that for making a lot of fencing, for making roofing shakes, that type of thing.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:28:43):**  Small adzes again for splitting out and shaping timber.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:28:49):**  Side axes, I could go on there's such a range of beautiful hand tools for making different  
**[0:28:57-0:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:28:57):**  products that we tend to use.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:28:59):**  I went looking for a good bill hook in the United States and they're kind of hard to  
**[0:29:05-0:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:29:05):**  find here.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:29:07):**  And I think the closest thing that I was able to find was a tool known as the Woodsman's  
**[0:29:11-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:29:11):**  Pal made here in the United States and it kind of has a slightly curved edge for chopping  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:29:19):**  and hacking on the front side and it has a sharpened hook on the back that you can cut  
**[0:29:23-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:29:23):**  smaller canes with.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:29:25):**  I'll have to ask around to some of the blacksmiths I know to see if anyone makes a bill hook  
**[0:29:29-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:29:29):**  or would consider making one.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:29:31):**  Yeah, I'm sure there will be.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:29:34):**  I mean I know there was a blacksmith from Wales who made very good bill hooks who settled  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:29:40):**  in Oregon, may still be around, the guy called Matt Spears, who was very good.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:29:45):**  So he might have some good patterns to follow but any good blacksmiths can make a tool.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:29:51):**  Once they got the pattern there, I'm sure they can make a fine bill hook.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:29:55):**  This is really just a personal question I have from me because I'm interested very much  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:29:59):**  in the traditional forestry skills and tools.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:30:04):**  How did you learn how to handle some of the tools that you do?  
**[0:30:08-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:30:08):**  Is there still a tradition within Britain in the United Kingdom to teach that or was  
**[0:30:14-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:30:14):**  it something that you had to seek out and find instructors for?  
**[0:30:18-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:30:18):**  It was very much something I had to seek out and find instructors for.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:30:22):**  I think now there's a great change in that.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:30:26):**  There's actually more people sharing skills and knowledge now and this is again very much  
**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:30:32):**  a permaculture approach to how people are working.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:30:37):**  Interestingly, anyone who had a real woodland skill, maybe they were a hurdle maker or basically  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:30:46):**  a fatterer making fetching spars for fetchers who were fetching roofs, they kind of held  
**[0:30:51-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:30:51):**  on to that skill and would pass it maybe through their family but very rarely pass it anywhere  
**[0:30:56-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:30:56):**  else.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:30:57):**  It was kind of this sort of, this is my livelihood, if I pass it on to you, you'll know how to  
**[0:31:02-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:31:02):**  do it and that's all that will threaten my livelihood.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:31:05):**  I remember going out about 25 years ago to try and actually learn some skills off some  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:31:12):**  of these older guys who were still out working in the woods and I remember going to see a  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:31:17):**  hurdle maker and he was out in the woods making hurdles out of hay for the hurdles like a  
**[0:31:22-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:31:22):**  woven panel that was traditionally used for keeping sheep in pen but nowadays it tends  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:31:29):**  to be used as a garden fence, very attractive sort of woven panel.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:31:34):**  He was making these and I would turn up and I offered to help him but he said, no, no,  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:31:39):**  he didn't really need any help and he'd chat to me but he would never ever do any work  
**[0:31:44-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:31:44):**  while I was there.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:31:45):**  He would stop working while I turned up.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:31:47):**  He didn't want to show me anything and I think that is very much the sort of the past generation  
**[0:31:54-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:31:54):**  of woodsmen really that had that kind of fear of sharing their skill in case it would affect  
**[0:32:01-0:32:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:32:01):**  their livelihood whereas fortunately now, I think we're at a time where we know how  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:32:05):**  important it is to give people these skills, we need to be sharing them.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:32:09):**  We need to be passing on land-based life skills and how to make things that we need and therefore,  
**[0:32:16-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:32:16):**  I guess it's partly what I do myself but more and more people are out there sharing  
**[0:32:22-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:32:22):**  the skill of how to use these particular tools and how to make a good quality roofing shake  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:32:28):**  or how to make a beautiful chair out of a piece of copper timber.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:32:33):**  I'm really glad to hear that this is expanding and that there's a possibility for more  
**[0:32:40-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:32:40):**  people to get involved so that we can keep these skills and traditions alive and also  
**[0:32:47-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:32:47):**  just to be able to use them in our practices.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:32:52):**  Part of my interest in this is that several of my past guests are people who were building  
**[0:32:56-0:33:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:32:56):**  without electricity or petrol of any kind and in doing so, they're trying to figure  
**[0:33:03-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:33:03):**  out how to do this work and a lot of it is they're finding that they have to recreate  
**[0:33:07-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:33:07):**  it as they go because it's just not available or the people who know it aren't teaching  
**[0:33:13-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:33:13):**  it anymore and I'd like to have more of this out there because it's being able to  
**[0:33:17-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:33:17):**  go into the woods and do the work and still be able to hear the birds sing and not to  
**[0:33:22-0:33:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:33:22):**  scare them away.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:33:23):**  Yes, no totally.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:33:26):**  I was chatting to an ex-apprentice of mine, Richard and he did a lot of chair making out  
**[0:33:31-0:33:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:33:31):**  in the woods now and he was describing making a rocking chair he just made and I sent him  
**[0:33:38-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:33:38):**  what you really enjoy about it most.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:33:41):**  He said, what I enjoy about it most is that there's no glues, there's no fixings, there's  
**[0:33:46-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:33:46):**  no need to visit the hardware store.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:33:49):**  I can start with a log in the wood and I can walk out of the chair and I never have to  
**[0:33:52-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:33:52):**  leave the woods.  
**[0:33:53-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:33:53):**  I think that's just a privilege of a way to work and be able to start by selling your  
**[0:34:00-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:34:00):**  tree in the environment you're living or working in and then to go through the whole  
**[0:34:06-0:34:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:34:06):**  process of turning it into the finished product and being able to do that without the need  
**[0:34:12-0:34:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:34:12):**  to think, oh I need to go and buy some nails or some screws or it's a good feeling.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:34:18):**  As you mentioned one of your apprentices, what about that social side of the work that  
**[0:34:25-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:34:25):**  you're doing of being a woodsman?  
**[0:34:28-0:34:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:34:28):**  Yes, the social side is really, really interesting how it's developing.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:34:34):**  I mean I think there is a really good sort of renaissance of traditional crafts and wood  
**[0:34:40-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:34:40):**  management in the UK now and not just traditional crafts, sort of modern crafts, things we realize  
**[0:34:46-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:34:46):**  we need now.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:34:47):**  I mean there are products made out of the poles that come out of the coppice woodland  
**[0:34:53-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:34:53):**  that were maybe 30 years ago.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:34:56):**  I don't think there were people in England making yurts out of coppice poles.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:35:01):**  Now there's lots of people making yurts.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:35:03):**  So these are sort of products that again the coppice wood can be used for.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:35:07):**  So it's not just all traditional with modern ones too.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:35:10):**  But the social side is interesting.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:35:13):**  I mean for me, I feel it would be kind of wrong not to be passing on and sharing what  
**[0:35:21-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:35:21):**  I'm doing to other people.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:35:23):**  At the end of the day, there's a limit to the amount of years I'll be able to go on  
**[0:35:27-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:35:27):**  doing this and it's great to be passing it on to young people.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:35:31):**  It's so enthusiastic to do it.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:35:33):**  I mean at the moment, I have two apprentices and I take on two every year and they spend  
**[0:35:40-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:35:40):**  usually about 11 months with me and they live in the woods.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:35:44):**  And by the end of it, they go off and start on the woodland of their own.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:35:51):**  Now what's been nice around the area where I am in the in Sussex in the southeast of  
**[0:35:57-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:35:57):**  England is that over the years, a large number of those ex-apprentices have settled in the  
**[0:36:04-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:36:04):**  area.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:36:05):**  So there's a good network of people who've got these skills in the area and if a big  
**[0:36:12-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:36:12):**  project comes up whether it might be a building project I've got on that around would or it  
**[0:36:18-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:36:18):**  might be a large order for a fencing project, then there's a network of people to call upon  
**[0:36:27-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:36:27):**  and I guess this group of sort of ex-apprentices, they all see each other socially as well.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:36:35):**  So work together a bit.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:36:37):**  So we kind of got this little woodland community that goes on within the area which is great.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:36:46):**  Similar ones of those set up in different parts of the country where people are using  
**[0:36:51-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:36:51):**  these skills.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:36:52):**  I think if you work in the woods and you coppice and you make things from the woods, you immediately  
**[0:36:58-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:36:58):**  kind of connect with other people doing similar things.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:37:02):**  So yeah, the social side of it is good and it's not to say that there isn't the other  
**[0:37:09-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:37:09):**  social party that goes on in the woods as well.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:37:11):**  I think about how as you do more and more of this work, you find the things that are  
**[0:37:17-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:37:17):**  tasty when they become fermented and you wish to share them with your friends.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:37:21):**  Absolutely, you got it.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:37:25):**  At the moment, it's spring here and well just at the beginning of spring and spring is coming  
**[0:37:31-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:37:31):**  quite early and in the moment, the birch trees, we cut the sap of the birch tree and make  
**[0:37:37-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:37:37):**  a wine from it.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:37:38):**  So we're doing that at the moment, we're chopping the trees.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:37:41):**  Now a lovely thing about that is it's quite a quick wine.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:37:45):**  So in six months time, by the time we sort of get to the autumn equinox, it's ready for  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:37:49):**  drinking and then at that time of the year, we're pressing the cider.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:37:54):**  The apples to make cider was then ready at this time of the year.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:37:58):**  So there's a nice sort of sequence even within what we sort of harvest and ferment as well.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:38:04):**  You get to live in and enjoy those patterns of nature.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:38:07):**  Absolutely, yeah.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:38:08):**  Very much part of it.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:38:11):**  In our time together, I think we've covered everything that I wanted to talk about.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:38:15):**  Is there anything else that you'd like to add to the conversation for the listeners  
**[0:38:19-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:38:19):**  before we bring it to a close?  
**[0:38:22-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:38:22):**  I guess I'd just like to sort of just mention a little bit about the immenseness of working  
**[0:38:29-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:38:29):**  within a woodland and the kind of magic of being out in nature even in an area where  
**[0:38:35-0:38:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:38:35):**  I am which is the southeast of England is the most highly populated part of England  
**[0:38:40-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:38:40):**  and you know, there's certainly probably not got anything like the kind of space you've  
**[0:38:45-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:38:45):**  got maybe around you in different parts of the states but even within here, just being  
**[0:38:51-0:38:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:38:51):**  out in that woodland, you can touch into something unique, ancient and a sense of wilderness  
**[0:38:59-0:39:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:38:59):**  which can be there right on your doorstep even on the edge of cities.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:39:04):**  I know people who work in woodlands on the outskirts of the cities and they can still  
**[0:39:09-0:39:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:39:09):**  kind of find that place there.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:39:11):**  Our woods are amazing places and they're so versatile and so diverse and there's so much  
**[0:39:19-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:39:19):**  that they can offer us and we can make from them as well and yeah, they're just the best  
**[0:39:24-0:39:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:39:24):**  place to hang out and work so they're my inspiration and yeah, I'd just like to share that with  
**[0:39:31-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:39:31):**  everyone and hope that everyone gets out there and appreciates them more.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:39:35):**  Go out, reconnect with nature, do good work and enjoy it all.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:39:41):**  That's it, that's it.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:39:45):**  A very special thanks to my good friend Scott Mann at the Permaculture Podcast for allowing  
**[0:39:50-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:39:50):**  me to rebroadcast this wonderful interview.

**[0:40:04-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:40:04):**  Now in the future, we'll be creating more episodes where the two or all three of us  
**[0:40:08-0:40:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:40:08):**  with Geocluthia as well will sit down to talk about what's happening in our respective corners  
**[0:40:13-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:40:13):**  of the world or as a round table to discuss listener questions.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:40:17):**  I already recorded a really fun session with Scott that will be coming out soon so stay

**[0:40:27-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:40:27):**  today every so often and even doing a couple of guest hosted episodes on one another's  
**[0:40:32-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:40:32):**  podcast from time to time and I'm really excited for that.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:40:36):**  If you're a producer in the regenerative media space such as a podcaster, streamer or video  
**[0:40:41-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:40:41):**  content producer, we would love to hear from you.

**[0:40:58-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:40:58):**  Then at the end of the year, to close things out and to shine a light on the people and  
**[0:41:02-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:41:02):**  the projects that made a real difference in 2022, in December we will award the RMA prize

**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/ben-law-on-the-way-of-the-woodsman/#t=0:41:27):**  towards a regenerative future and the Regenerative Media Alliance and I will be right by your

**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:00:09):**  You're in the right place for all things regenerative living, ecological restoration,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:00:14):**  permaculture and natural building.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:00:16):**  I'm your host Oliver Gaucher.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:00:18):**  In this show, it's my job to interview leaders, innovators and rebels on the cutting edge  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:00:22):**  of their fields as we look for solutions to our generation's most urgent challenges  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:00:27):**  and share these techniques and information so that you can join us in creating a healthy  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:00:31):**  and abundant world for everyone.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:00:33):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:00:42):**  A lot of big and unexpected changes have come up this year.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:00:46):**  And though we've all been affected in different ways and are adapting the best that we can,  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:00:50):**  there's no doubt that we all need to reskill for an uncertain future.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:00:54):**  But I for one refuse to adapt to a world of declining life and degraded land.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:00:59):**  I will, however, adapt and reskill for a future in which we as humans reclaim our role as  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:01:04):**  stewards of the earth and step up to the challenge of restoring the damage that government and  
**[0:01:09-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:01:09):**  business leaders frankly are too slow to confront.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:01:12):**  This is why 2020 will be the last season of the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:01:17):**  But don't worry, this is far from the end.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:01:19):**  Starting next season, this show will undergo a transformation.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:01:22):**  You listeners who love hearing inspiring stories about regeneration in all its many forms are  
**[0:01:27-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:01:27):**  in the right place.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:01:28):**  Those of you who want actionable information that you can apply to your own life and your  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:01:32):**  own projects don't have to change anything either.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:01:36):**  Starting on the 6th of February in 2021, this show will be called Regenerative Skills, and  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:01:41):**  I'll be producing shorter episodes that focus on the stories of people just like you all  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:01:45):**  around the world who are rising to the challenge of our generation and taking their futures  
**[0:01:50-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:01:50):**  into their own hands.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:01:52):**  The Regenerative Skills Podcast is also going to offer a lot of new ways for you to participate  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:01:57):**  and get involved yourself, and to have your own questions answered too.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:02:01):**  So stay tuned to the remaining episodes for this season, as I'll be giving sneak previews  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:02:05):**  of the new show and interactive learning platform in the coming weeks.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:02:09):**  I'm so excited to get this new chapter started with all of you and this incredible community  
**[0:02:13-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:02:13):**  of listeners.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:02:14):**  I feel like we're just getting warmed up.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:02:19):**  Hey there and welcome back, friends and family, to this ongoing series on waterway regeneration.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:02:24):**  Now in the past three episodes I focused on marine regeneration through conservation as  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:02:28):**  well as farming, but today we're going to take a closer look at freshwater systems and  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:02:33):**  specifically how to decontaminate them through biological methods.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:02:38):**  Now some of you may remember an interview that I did with Tom Duncan in Australia about  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:02:43):**  his floating wetlands and how they can be used to clean up excessive nutrients and pollutants  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:02:47):**  back in season 2, but today I'll be expanding on that technique since it's gained a lot  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:02:52):**  of traction and floating islands are popping up all over the world to help deal with contaminated  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:02:57):**  rivers, lakes, and ponds, and I'll be sure to put a link to that interview in the show  
**[0:03:01-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:03:01):**  notes for this website in case you missed it.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:03:03):**  For this episode, however, I reached out to Galen Fulford, the managing director of Biomatrix  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:03:09):**  Water, a biological technology company working on solutions for waterway and wastewater treatment  
**[0:03:14-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:03:14):**  based in Moray, Scotland.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:03:16):**  In this interview, Galen explains the science behind waterway contamination evaluation and  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:03:21):**  the calculations that they do in order to determine restoration approaches and techniques  
**[0:03:26-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:03:26):**  that are appropriate for each site.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:03:28):**  He also breaks down how their floating wetland systems work and how they compare and differ  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:03:32):**  from traditional wetland systems in the way that they decontaminate water and provide  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:03:37):**  habitat and sanctuaries for wildlife.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:03:39):**  We also explore the challenges that installing floating wetlands in urban environments can  
**[0:03:43-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:03:43):**  entail as well as some of the novel solutions in engineering that Biomatrix Water has developed  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:03:49):**  in order to help their installations withstand events like floods and heavy contamination  
**[0:03:53-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:03:53):**  loads.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:03:54):**  So this is a really good episode for people who want to understand the biology and engineering  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:03:59):**  behind some of the most promising natural waterway remediation techniques that are being  
**[0:04:03-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:04:03):**  pioneered today.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:04:05):**  So make sure you listen all the way to the end as well when Galen explains how these  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:04:09):**  floating wetland systems are being applied to ecological sewage treatment and municipal  
**[0:04:14-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:04:14):**  water purification.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:04:16):**  So from here I'll hand the discussion over to Galen.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:04:19):**  Hey Galen, thanks so much for taking time to be on the show today.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:04:22):**  How are things going up in Scotland and how are things going with your work?  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:04:25):**  Hi Albert, yeah things are going very well with our work up here in Scotland.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:04:30):**  It's typically gray morning but beautiful nonetheless.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:04:33):**  I was out for a bike ride along the beach and just connecting with the element of water  
**[0:04:39-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:04:39):**  before I delve into working with it.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:04:41):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:04:42):**  Yeah, that's a part of the UK I haven't been to.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:04:46):**  Half of my family is from that region but they're from further south in Britain and  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:04:49):**  that's an area I'd really love to come and visit sometime.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:04:53):**  So to get us started, Galen could you tell me about how you got started working in waterway  
**[0:04:58-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:04:58):**  regeneration?  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:04:59):**  What sort of led you down that path?  
**[0:05:02-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:05:02):**  Yeah, well basically I started out working in the US with natural wastewater treatment  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:05:09):**  systems, constructed wetlands and multi-stage reed beds and so forth.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:05:15):**  And we were really looking at water treatment and water recycling.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:05:19):**  And from there we were doing some projects in China and India and I remember one day  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:05:29):**  being up in the Jin Mao building in Shanghai and looking out across Shanghai and just the  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:05:34):**  sea of skyscrapers.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:05:38):**  And it had the real impact on me to say that we need to develop solutions and techniques  
**[0:05:45-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:05:45):**  and technologies and ways of working that are modular and replicable and scalable if  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:05:52):**  we're to have a chance of making any kind of change in the world.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:05:56):**  So that then led me down the path of looking for natural water treatment and water recycling  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:06:03):**  systems which are modular, scalable and replicable.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:06:07):**  And that led me into the world of floating ecosystems.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:06:10):**  And we had been working with some at that stage and they needed much more development.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:06:18):**  So I got to work developing different types of floating ecosystems and over the years  
**[0:06:26-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:06:26):**  we've discovered that there's a huge potential really in the area of waterway regeneration  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:06:33):**  for the same, essentially the same module which we also still do use for water treatment  
**[0:06:39-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:06:39):**  and water recycling as well as a matter of fact.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:06:42):**  It sounds like you've really moved from technologically based systems from what you were working in  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:06:48):**  before, I assume that's what it was, and kind of mechanical water treatment systems more  
**[0:06:52-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:06:52):**  into biological ones.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:06:55):**  What sort of got you to look into those options and veer away from what we might call more  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:07:01):**  traditional modern ways of purifying water?  
**[0:07:05-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:07:05):**  I suppose that in actual fact we've always been focused on the biological, but we've  
**[0:07:14-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:07:14):**  been working more and more looking at different ways to harness that power in situ directly  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:07:21):**  within the waterways we're trying to improve.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:07:26):**  So rather than, I think traditionally you have systems which are end of pipe or intercepting  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:07:33):**  flows and so forth and then discharging cleaner clean and treated water.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:07:38):**  And what we've discovered over the years is that there's many situations where that end  
**[0:07:43-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:07:43):**  of pipe situation is just not feasible.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:07:45):**  A, because there isn't a pipe, it's just an open sewer or B, the pipe that might be too  
**[0:07:50-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:07:50):**  hard to locate or the pollution in the waterway might be non-point source, just diffused.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:07:58):**  And that has led us down to more in situ techniques.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:08:04):**  And we're still quite technical and we're just commissioning new machines.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:08:10):**  We design our own hydraulic machines and everything that make our components, but all of those  
**[0:08:16-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:08:16):**  components are purely about giving nature the total that it needs to thrive and flourish  
**[0:08:23-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:08:23):**  and do what it does best, powered by photosynthesis and biology and ecology rather than flocculants  
**[0:08:32-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:08:32):**  and chemicals and so forth.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:08:34):**  Well, so before I start asking you about the components in your systems and how you evaluate  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:08:39):**  which ones will be appropriate, can you tell me about the challenges and the degradation  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:08:44):**  that our rivers and freshwater resources are facing all around the world?  
**[0:08:48-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:08:48):**  Oh, geez.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:08:49):**  I mean, it's just it's a big topic.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:08:53):**  So it's so vast.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:08:57):**  And God, where to begin?  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:09:01):**  You know, if we look at places like Europe, everywhere is farmland.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:09:07):**  You know, there's so little wild land left everywhere is farmland.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:09:12):**  What that means is that you have massive amounts of nutrients and sediment running off into  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:09:17):**  the waterways and then those waterways are then channelized and then they all go out  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:09:22):**  into basically estuaries, you know, eventually along the coast.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:09:28):**  And pretty much almost without exception, each of these estuaries has a city on it,  
**[0:09:36-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:09:36):**  particularly on the major river system.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:09:38):**  So how basically that critical eco tone between freshwater brackish and then saline ecosystems,  
**[0:09:46-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:09:46):**  which are so critical to, for example, the salmon life cycle are then decapitated with  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:09:53):**  these hard edge concrete and steel sheet pile walls.  
**[0:09:57-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:09:57):**  So that's one impact.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:09:59):**  Then if you go into places like India, you have just huge amounts of wastewater untreated  
**[0:10:08-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:10:08):**  flowing into the waterways.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:10:10):**  So that is a huge, huge issue.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:10:12):**  You know, in most cities you've got less than half the population actually connected to  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:10:18):**  wastewater treatment plants.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:10:20):**  And so you just have huge amounts of raw sewage flowing into the waterways and they then become  
**[0:10:26-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:10:26):**  anoxic and basically the fish die and it just kills the whole thing, the smell horrible,  
**[0:10:33-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:10:33):**  you know.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:10:34):**  So loads of waterways like that.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:10:36):**  And then obviously you've got all the other rivers that are up in the mountains.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:10:40):**  Maybe they've got some wilderness left around them, but by goodness, they're all full of  
**[0:10:44-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:10:44):**  dams.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:10:45):**  So a huge amount of impact on the world's waterways.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:10:49):**  Yeah, there seems to be, and I can't imagine when it actually started to be viewed this  
**[0:10:56-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:10:56):**  way, but our waterways are looked at often as free waste disposal alleys or methods.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:11:04):**  And even though obviously they're essential for so many functions in an ecosystem, where  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:11:11):**  is this kind of breakdown in understanding of their value?  
**[0:11:16-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:11:16):**  And I'm kind of looking for words here as to where this may have originated and how  
**[0:11:23-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:11:23):**  you're working with clients to start at the source is that how these resources are viewed  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:11:29):**  and the relationships with the communities that they pass through before you can go in  
**[0:11:34-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:11:34):**  and actually start to remediate the health of the waterways themselves.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:11:45):**  I mean, it's a process of erosion, you know, and psychological erosion, I guess, in many  
**[0:11:52-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:11:52):**  ways.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:11:53):**  And I think that the other thing to keep in mind, which we sometimes overlook, you know,  
**[0:11:56-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:11:56):**  we say, well, you know, why are people putting so much pollution in the river?  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:11:58):**  You know, can't they go somewhere else?  
**[0:12:02-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:12:02):**  But there's a real difficult physical reality that, you know, if when we think about wastewater  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:12:09):**  or gray water, stormwater, it's going to go somewhere.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:12:14):**  You know, we're not going to put it into a big tank and evaporate it into steam.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:12:19):**  So that water basically has to go somewhere.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:12:22):**  We can ground recharge as much as possible, which is really important.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:12:26):**  But essentially, excuse me, all that contaminated water flows downhill and eventually makes  
**[0:12:33-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:12:33):**  its way into a water body.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:12:35):**  So if there isn't very rigorous treatment along the way, that leads to ongoing pollution,  
**[0:12:41-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:12:41):**  degradation of the waterway or water body.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:12:44):**  And then that then reaches a tipping point where it's no longer a pristine resource that  
**[0:12:51-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:12:51):**  you want to drink and swim and, you know, frolic in, but becomes something which is  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:12:57):**  past that tipping point of vitality and abundance.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:13:01):**  And then it becomes a, you know, essentially a waste transport system.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:13:07):**  But even our, you know, everywhere around the world, the rivers are where the wastewater  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:13:13):**  and stormwater ends up.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:13:15):**  The question is, is there sufficient treatment along the way to make sure that that doesn't  
**[0:13:20-0:13:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:13:20):**  have such a detrimental environmental impact that it pushes it over a threshold?  
**[0:13:27-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:13:27):**  And often that threshold is called the total daily mass load of pollution that that waterway  
**[0:13:35-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:13:35):**  can handle.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:13:36):**  So basically there will be a environmental agency or EPA study of a waterway and watershed.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:13:44):**  And they'll say, okay, well, based on the volume flow ecology of this river, we think  
**[0:13:48-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:13:48):**  it can handle X number kilograms of phosphorus and nitrogen per day without tipping it into  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:13:55):**  eutrophication, et cetera.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:13:59):**  I can only imagine how far beyond that limit so many different waterways are now.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:14:04):**  I really like that you sort of broke down some of the macro issues, different regions  
**[0:14:10-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:14:10):**  of the world.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:14:11):**  Certainly on an individual basis, the context of each one is probably a lot more nuanced  
**[0:14:16-0:14:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:14:16):**  and complex.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:14:18):**  How do you assess a new project and sort of calculate or determine the measures and approaches  
**[0:14:24-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:14:24):**  that will be effective for that project's remediation?  
**[0:14:27-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:14:27):**  Gosh.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:14:28):**  I imagine it's a long process.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:14:32):**  Do you have sort of a playbook that you follow or do you really take it on a context basis  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:14:37):**  and rewrite the steps as you go into something new?  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:14:42):**  Well basically there's a couple of different ways that we approach it.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:14:45):**  In the first instance, it's important to keep in mind that the process of a waterway becoming  
**[0:14:50-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:14:50):**  degraded, reaching that point where it exceeds its stated or real world total daily mass  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:14:59):**  load, tipping over that balance, the ecology beginning to crash, it becoming anoxic, fish  
**[0:15:05-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:15:05):**  beginning to go elsewhere, et cetera.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:15:10):**  It's not like somebody made one decision that happens.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:15:13):**  It usually happens little by little by little by little with one inflow, another inflow,  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:15:19):**  and then another inflow reaching that point when the waterway or the ecosystem can no  
**[0:15:24-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:15:24):**  longer cope.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:15:26):**  So the reason I think that that's important to understand that step by step process is  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:15:30):**  that the process of restoration is also step by step.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:15:34):**  It's not so much a case of saying, okay, there's that river.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:15:39):**  Well it needs two caribas, set them all, three ibuprofen, 45 floating ecosystems, two new  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:15:46):**  wastewater treatment plants.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:15:49):**  Usually that's not feasible for financial and political reasons.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:15:55):**  Although ideally that is really what you would want to do.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:16:00):**  So we do do a system where we basically survey the water body and we measure the flow and  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:16:07):**  then with the flow we measure the concentration of different nutrients.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:16:12):**  That then gives us essentially what equates to a mass loading.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:16:18):**  So multiplying the milligrams per liter by the flow down the river, we can determine  
**[0:16:23-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:16:23):**  essentially what the kilograms of nitrogen, phosphorus, BOD, TSS, COD, et cetera are in  
**[0:16:30-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:16:30):**  that river.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:16:32):**  And that gives us a sense of what the mass load of pollution in that water body is.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:16:40):**  And then we can look at a prescription or a series of solutions to solve that problem,  
**[0:16:49-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:16:49):**  to reduce that mass loading to a level that we would be aiming for it to come back to  
**[0:16:55-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:16:55):**  life.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:16:56):**  Two to three, ideally up to five milligrams per liter of oxygen, for example, that kind  
**[0:17:03-0:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:17:03):**  of thing.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:17:04):**  So we do do that.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:17:06):**  It's a process of combining hydrometry with water chemistry on site.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:17:12):**  And the difficulty with it is that obviously the waterway is changing hour to hour diurnally,  
**[0:17:19-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:17:19):**  seasonally, et cetera.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:17:21):**  So your snapshot of mass loading is only one point in time when you carry out that hydrometry  
**[0:17:28-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:17:28):**  and so forth.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:17:29):**  So you can mitigate that by composite sampling and so forth and doing it over the year.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:17:35):**  But you can see that it quickly becomes quite complex.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:17:37):**  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:17:39):**  I'm glad you brought that up because anytime you're gathering data from a dynamic living  
**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:17:43):**  system like that, you're only getting a snapshot like you mentioned.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:17:47):**  And is it a matter of compiling sort of an average among different seasons or is it really  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:17:53):**  worthwhile to look at, OK, these solutions are going to be appropriate perhaps at this  
**[0:17:59-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:17:59):**  time of the year, but there needs to be a different strategy as it goes into different  
**[0:18:02-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:18:02):**  seasons or if there's a flooding event, the installations are going to have to be able  
**[0:18:09-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:18:09):**  to take the difference in circumstances or be temporarily removed?  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:18:16):**  Is it really looked at a seasonal and timeframe basis like that or do you kind of go through  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:18:22):**  mainframe solutions and look for things that are going to work generally, even if not terribly  
**[0:18:28-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:18:28):**  specifically for an entire year or an entire period of time that you're looking to make  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:18:35):**  something effective?  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:18:39):**  We would be looking for something that will be working most of the time.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:18:44):**  We definitely don't want to be taking things in and out.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:18:48):**  But in practice, what ends up happening is that each project is a step on the way towards  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:18:56):**  restoring health by diversity and vitality to that water body.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:19:00):**  So rarely does anyone or even any government have the opportunity to say, right, let's  
**[0:19:06-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:19:06):**  sort out that river.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:19:07):**  We're going to build these five new waste water treatment plants, this 20 million in  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:19:12):**  stormwater mitigation, all these riparian ecosystems.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:19:18):**  That just rarely happens because of the financial and physical constraints.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:19:24):**  So what does happen is many projects progressively being implemented to progress the waterway  
**[0:19:34-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:19:34):**  back on a course to help.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:19:36):**  That makes sense.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:19:37):**  Can you tell me a little bit about some of these solutions and steps towards reviving  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:19:44):**  the health of a waterway that you have been involved in implementing?  
**[0:19:48-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:19:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:19:50):**  So typically, you know, you would be looking at doing some more wastewater treatment.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:19:55):**  So looking at where the main offenders in terms of influence pollution loading and those  
**[0:20:03-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:20:03):**  can be determined through their mass loading discharge and trying to implement secondary  
**[0:20:10-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:20:10):**  or tertiary treatment stages on the back end of those often ecosystem integrated, constructed  
**[0:20:18-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:20:18):**  wetlands going into helix flow reactor type of activated wetland systems to provide additional  
**[0:20:26-0:20:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:20:26):**  treatment.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:20:27):**  And that work is happening all over the place at the moment.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:20:30):**  Weapons are getting stricter in the US, in Europe, in Asia, all over the place.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:20:36):**  People are trying to improve those discharges and building new waste water treatment plants  
**[0:20:43-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:20:43):**  with stricter regulations.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:20:45):**  So from then the next area becomes the stormwater loading.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:20:50):**  Huge amounts of stormwater are flushed into our waterways and there's fantastic legislation  
**[0:20:57-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:20:57):**  which is getting better and better all the time around stormwater, such systems, sustainable  
**[0:21:03-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:21:03):**  urban drainage systems, absorbing more of that water into the ground and also improving  
**[0:21:10-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:21:10):**  the quality of it, providing one, two, three, four steps of treatment before it actually  
**[0:21:17-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:21:17):**  is discharged into a water course.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:21:20):**  So that's another area where we work in stormwater systems providing stormwater ponds that have  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:21:27):**  aeration, circulation, floating ecosystems in them, active edge filters, these kinds  
**[0:21:33-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:21:33):**  of things to help to ensure that the stormwater flowing into the water course is also mitigated  
**[0:21:39-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:21:39):**  and balanced.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:21:40):**  And then thirdly, we work directly in the water course water body itself with floating  
**[0:21:46-0:21:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:21:46):**  ecosystems, solar active island reactors, these types of things to provide direct in-situ  
**[0:21:54-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:21:54):**  water quality habitat and biodiversity enhancement.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:21:57):**  Well, so let's take a closer look then at the floating islands because I know that this  
**[0:22:02-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:22:02):**  is one of the solutions that Biomatrix water has been best known for, perhaps most visible  
**[0:22:08-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:22:08):**  for.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:22:09):**  Can you tell me a bit about how they work and where they're appropriate?  
**[0:22:14-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:22:14):**  Yep, sure.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:22:18):**  Basically the floating ecosystems are really most applicable and most appropriate in locations  
**[0:22:26-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:22:26):**  where you need a concentrated ecosystem, wetland ecosystem effect.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:22:34):**  And you can either integrate them with stormwater or wastewater systems to provide a natural  
**[0:22:41-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:22:41):**  element to those that is essentially utilizing photosynthesis, the relationship between the  
**[0:22:48-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:22:48):**  bacteria on the plant roots and the biofilms that grow there to help to naturally enhance  
**[0:22:54-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:22:54):**  that treatment process.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:22:57):**  Or you can use them directly in the water course.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:23:00):**  And we don't typically install floating ecosystems out in the countryside in areas where you  
**[0:23:07-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:23:07):**  have lots of existing ecology and riparian edges already doing their thing because there's  
**[0:23:13-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:23:13):**  not so much of a need.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:23:14):**  However, in areas where you don't have that natural riparian ecology, those natural treatment  
**[0:23:23-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:23:23):**  processes functioning as efficiently or literally because often there's physical constraints,  
**[0:23:30-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:23:30):**  that's where floating ecosystems really come into their own.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:23:34):**  So most of our projects actually end up being in urban and peri-urban areas where you have  
**[0:23:40-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:23:40):**  hard vertical walls and essentially a decapitated aquatic ecosystem where that whole rich, incredibly  
**[0:23:49-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:23:49):**  biodiverse and beautiful and functional edge of the waterway is just cut off by the hard  
**[0:23:58-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:23:58):**  infrastructure.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:24:00):**  And often that can in some places be overcome through removing those hard edges and then  
**[0:24:06-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:24:06):**  sloping back the edge.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:24:09):**  Typically that slope would be at a three to one, four to one, a very shallow gradient  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:24:14):**  as you would find on the edge of most waterways.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:24:19):**  However, achieving that shallow gradient within a suburb would mean often hundreds of houses  
**[0:24:27-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:24:27):**  having to be removed and that streets realigned and everything and that very quickly becomes  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:24:33):**  unfeasible.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:24:34):**  So we can restore that riparian edge simply by putting it into the water in a floating  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:24:42):**  context.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:24:44):**  So we have all of that rich diversity that we would normally have at the edge of a waterway  
**[0:24:51-0:24:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:24:51):**  suddenly is able to boom within a few months, burst into life right along the edge of the  
**[0:24:58-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:24:58):**  steel or concrete edge without impacting any of the infrastructure or incurring all those  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:25:04):**  costs that would be associated with it without taking up any more land.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:25:09):**  And additionally within that ecosystem we can really optimize it and design it in a  
**[0:25:15-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:25:15):**  way that it can be very rich indeed.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:25:18):**  So we have for example elevated tree planters or submerged gravel beds in a place like the  
**[0:25:24-0:25:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:25:24):**  Chicago River for example.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:25:26):**  There's so much silt and sediment in that waterway that there's no kind of spawning  
**[0:25:32-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:25:32):**  or breeding gravel at the bottom for the invertebrates and fish that like that kind of substrate.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:25:40):**  But we can actually create a suspended hanging gravel bed to provide that habitat within  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:25:47):**  that ecosystem.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:25:49):**  So then there'll be a flood and that whole gravel bed will rise up with the flood one,  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:25:54):**  two, three meters and then settle back down.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:25:57):**  So it's quite a dynamic and interesting type of ecosystem.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:26:03):**  Yes, fantastic.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:26:05):**  And I've seen a couple of companies that have their own versions of these floating wetlands.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:26:11):**  It's basically a way of putting in the ecosystem function of a wetland without having to eat  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:26:18):**  up the amount of land that it would normally take.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:26:22):**  But because these are suspended in the water, because they're floating and the root systems  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:26:26):**  are down in the water, they function a little differently than a conventional wetland or  
**[0:26:31-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:26:31):**  swamp area where the roots aren't necessarily exposed.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:26:37):**  Can you talk a little bit about how they function differently biologically and if there are  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:26:41):**  any advantages or disadvantages to each?  
**[0:26:45-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:26:45):**  Yeah, it's very interesting in its difference because basically all of the wetland plants  
**[0:26:52-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:26:52):**  that we would typically be planting, traditionally they are found growing in the mud.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:26:58):**  So they're absorbing their nutrients from the sediment.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:27:03):**  But when we put them into a floating ecosystem, there's no sediment and it's basically a hydroponic  
**[0:27:10-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:27:10):**  system.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:27:11):**  So the roots grow right through it and we design the layers of material within the ecosystem  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:27:17):**  very carefully to allow that full root penetration down into the water.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:27:23):**  And because there is no other way else for them to get their nutrients, they're not growing  
**[0:27:26-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:27:26):**  in the sediment, all of their phosphorus and nitrogen and so forth that they require for  
**[0:27:32-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:27:32):**  their growth comes directly out of the water itself.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:27:35):**  So that's a real benefit to water quality, which you wouldn't achieve if that same plant  
**[0:27:40-0:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:27:40):**  was actually just growing in sediment at the riverbank.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:27:45):**  Yeah, so it seems like you're getting a whole lot more surface area filtration doing it  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:27:52):**  this way and that there are also other benefits for having these root systems in the water  
**[0:27:58-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:27:58):**  that create ideal spawning conditions or protection for wildlife.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:28:06):**  And it's almost like a concentrated way of including the benefits of a much larger wetland  
**[0:28:12-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:28:12):**  and being able to place it just about anywhere, like you said, in these hard and cut-off barriers  
**[0:28:19-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:28:19):**  in urban and peri-urban environments.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:28:22):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:28:27):**  It's also a very challenging environment for engineering.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:28:33):**  You've got flooding and debris flowing down the river and all sorts of issues that really  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:28:38):**  have to be taken very carefully into account.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:28:42):**  But when you get the design and the technology and the materials right, it can be incredibly  
**[0:28:47-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:28:47):**  versatile and functional.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:28:50):**  And we typically have mixes of ecosystems, not such wide expanses, but more pockets and  
**[0:28:58-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:28:58):**  open pools.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:29:00):**  And that's what really gives the rich diversity.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:29:05):**  And in many ways, it's like a riverbank or a stream bank that's undercut with moss and  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:29:13):**  one of those great areas where the trout are hanging out on a mountain stream, where you  
**[0:29:18-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:29:18):**  can lean over the bank and do the famous trout tickling.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:29:22):**  It's kind of like that ecosystem.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:29:24):**  And when we put a camera underneath, we just see loads of fish and eels hanging out under  
**[0:29:31-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:29:31):**  there.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:29:32):**  When we put in an open pool, birds like crested grebes swim underwater and pop up in the open  
**[0:29:37-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:29:37):**  pool, make their nest in that sheltered environment that they can only access by swimming into.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:29:43):**  So it provides quite a unique habitat as well as functionality with the reefs absorbing  
**[0:29:51-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:29:51):**  nutrients directly from the water.  
**[0:29:54-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:29:54):**  Tell me a little bit about how you make these floating islands, what the materials are,  
**[0:30:00-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:30:00):**  and can you give me maybe a cost estimate for a typical floating island of the dimensions  
**[0:30:08-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:30:08):**  that you're familiar with?  
**[0:30:11-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:30:11):**  Sort of a little case study, something for reference.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:30:13):**  Sure.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:30:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:30:15):**  So when basically back in the early days when we were said, okay, great, let's utilize some  
**[0:30:22-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:30:22):**  more of this, let's see what's out there and maybe we can buy some of these components  
**[0:30:26-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:30:26):**  from so and so.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:30:29):**  And what we found was that there are some different things available, but there's nothing  
**[0:30:34-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:30:34):**  that really met either the structural or sustainability requirements that we have in mind.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:30:42):**  So we didn't want to use any foam.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:30:45):**  We didn't want to use any polystyrene or polyurethane foams because we felt like it  
**[0:30:52-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:30:52):**  was important that the materials that were utilized in this were as absolutely sustainable  
**[0:30:57-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:30:57):**  as possible.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:30:59):**  And we also felt like we didn't want there to be any potential for plastic fibers, microplastic  
**[0:31:07-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:31:07):**  fibers or things that are kind of nonwoven to erode away.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:31:14):**  And we found that these were very common features within the available technology on the market.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:31:21):**  So that sent us back to the drawing board to say, okay, well, we know we're not going  
**[0:31:25-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:31:25):**  to do that.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:31:28):**  What are we going to do that's different?  
**[0:31:30-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:31:30):**  And we also found that we were getting inquiries for projects and people really wanting to  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:31:37):**  invest in restoring their waterways, but the locations were often very challenging in terms  
**[0:31:43-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:31:43):**  of physical considerations, floodwaters, changing water levels, this kind of thing.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:31:51):**  And the structural capacity of the force of a river and flood, for example, you can't  
**[0:31:59-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:31:59):**  laugh it off.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:32:00):**  You really have to think about it carefully.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:32:03):**  So we also found that nothing was meeting the structural requirements.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:32:06):**  So that also drove us back to the drawing board.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:32:09):**  So what we developed is really a, it's a very engineered and structural system at its base.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:32:18):**  And basically it involves a recycled HDPE flotation pods.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:32:26):**  And those we can configure in all different ways.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:32:29):**  And we had to invent and develop a special machinery to make these pods from recycled  
**[0:32:36-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:32:36):**  material that just didn't exist anywhere previously.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:32:42):**  And we're very excited.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:32:43):**  We're just commissioning the next development of this special machine.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:32:47):**  So we take these recycled HDPE flotation pods and HDPE is basically the same material that's  
**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:32:57):**  used to make drinking water pipes.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:33:00):**  So all around the world, when they're laying these pipes and they do this fusion to lay  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:33:05):**  them in, that's really what's used, all of our drinking water comes through these days.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:33:11):**  So it is a plastic material, but it's a very inert plastic material.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:33:16):**  Different plastics have things that make them soft, et cetera.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:33:21):**  So on the one hand you have materials like PVC, which releases all sorts of stuff into  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:33:27):**  the surrounds and is not at all a material that we would want to be using in this situation.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:33:32):**  So we never use that.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:33:34):**  On the other hand, you have things like HDPE, which is much more inert and is food grade  
**[0:33:40-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:33:40):**  material.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:33:41):**  And then we take that HDPE and then we take it in a recycled stream.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:33:46):**  So it's often actually from upgrading water pipes that are pulled out of the ground, ground  
**[0:33:52-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:33:52):**  up and then we remanufacture them into our buoyancy pods.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:33:57):**  Then we connect these together with marine grade stainless steel and we have developed  
**[0:34:03-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:34:03):**  a whole bunch of special components that allow us to connect these in really structural and  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:34:10):**  useful ways that we can have all sorts of adaptors and connectors and so forth, but  
**[0:34:15-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:34:15):**  that can respond to the needs of different shapes and designs as well as the dynamicity  
**[0:34:23-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:34:23):**  of different water environments.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:34:25):**  And then we have a whole range of different planting substrates that we utilize.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:34:29):**  So we go from a 2D threats back to 2D, 3D, 4D and we're just working now with 5D specification  
**[0:34:39-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:34:39):**  projects, which utilize wood chip and clay material as the planting substrate.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:34:45):**  And we've also just been launching new systems, which are actually using Scottish Oak as a  
**[0:34:51-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:34:51):**  part of the edging to help hold in the different planting materials.  
**[0:34:54-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:34:54):**  So essentially our component and material philosophy is that everything that we should  
**[0:35:00-0:35:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:35:00):**  use, everything we want to use to design this ecosystem should be in the first instance,  
**[0:35:06-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:35:06):**  organic and natural, but where we require the real engineering and longevity of a fully  
**[0:35:15-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:35:15):**  infrastructure quality system, then it should be recycled and recyclable.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:35:21):**  So that's where we go into the HDPE and the stainless steel.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:35:26):**  And yeah, so that's kind of the material composition, if that makes sense.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:35:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:35:33):**  And it seems like, you know, if you're creating sort of the gold standard of these floating  
**[0:35:37-0:35:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:35:37):**  systems that are meant to withstand not just the installation of the project, but also  
**[0:35:46-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:35:46):**  as it becomes more mature and it grows and it develops in its location, that it'll still  
**[0:35:52-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:35:52):**  hold up to that as well.  
**[0:35:55-0:35:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:35:55):**  You really have to be very selective about the materials that you choose.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:35:58):**  Not many are going to fit that description.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:36:01):**  Is there a way of doing this as kind of a more temporary floating system with predominantly  
**[0:36:08-0:36:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:36:08):**  natural materials knowing that it's probably going to decompose and need to be reinstalled  
**[0:36:13-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:36:13):**  within a certain period of time?  
**[0:36:15-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:36:15):**  Or is this really the best way that you found as a balance between the natural materials  
**[0:36:21-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:36:21):**  and the higher engineered stuff for the most effective installation?  
**[0:36:29-0:36:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:36:29):**  So if you have water that's two, some maybe two and a half to three feet deep, you can  
**[0:36:36-0:36:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:36:36):**  utilize an interesting system that's completely natural and you can do yourself where you  
**[0:36:42-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:36:42):**  basically build up the elevation.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:36:45):**  So basically planting into that water depth is very difficult.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:36:48):**  Many water plants will grow in two to three feet of water, but it's very hard to establish  
**[0:36:56-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:36:56):**  them in that depth.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:36:57):**  You can imagine you're taking out a little plug plant and reaching way down into the  
**[0:37:01-0:37:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:37:01):**  mud to try and plant it.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:37:03):**  It can be quite difficult.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:37:04):**  However, what you can do in these situations is basically use a bundle of brushwood and  
**[0:37:11-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:37:11):**  plant into that.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:37:13):**  And as the plant grows and matures, the brushwood will biodegrade.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:37:19):**  And so basically you're slowly bringing the plant down to the sediment level as it's growing  
**[0:37:26-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:37:26):**  in height.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:37:27):**  So that can be a really nice system which is completely natural and you can do yourself.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:37:32):**  And just want to make sure that your brushwood is tied with natural jute or coir cordage.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:37:40):**  And often within that you would bundle some stones to hold it in position or use chestnut  
**[0:37:46-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:37:46):**  stakes to stake it into the side.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:37:48):**  So that can be a really good solution.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:37:50):**  When you get into deeper waterways with more energy and flow to them, it's very difficult  
**[0:37:56-0:37:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:37:56):**  to do with just natural materials.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:37:58):**  So you might think, okay, we can make this with bamboo and so forth.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:38:04):**  And you can, but it becomes difficult what happens when that starts to degrade and suddenly  
**[0:38:09-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:38:09):**  you've got a big chunk of bamboo and plants floating off down the river.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:38:15):**  Is that going to get stuck under some bridge or on some boat or something?  
**[0:38:18-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:38:18):**  So it's as attractive as it is.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:38:22):**  And I have made islands in that way and they're great fun to do, but it's not something that  
**[0:38:28-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:38:28):**  you can really scale and replicate within an urban environment at any great extent.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:38:36):**  Well, I'm really glad to hear that you've tried this out in a number of different ways.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:38:41):**  Do you have resources or links that you can share to help listeners figure out how to  
**[0:38:48-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:38:48):**  make some of these things that are lower cost and mostly natural materials for experimentation  
**[0:38:53-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:38:53):**  in their own sites?  
**[0:38:55-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:38:55):**  Oh, geez, I haven't put together a how to on that type of system.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:39:05):**  It's very much a kind of making it up on site, but really you're just trying to use whatever  
**[0:39:11-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:39:11):**  natural materials you have available.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:39:13):**  So it's kind of, I think what gets difficult is when you have people doing do it yourself  
**[0:39:22-0:39:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:39:22):**  kind of homemade systems from not natural materials.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:39:27):**  So then you've got people putting chunks of styrofoam and all kinds of stuff and lashing  
**[0:39:33-0:39:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:39:33):**  it up with fishing line and rope and pieces of net and so forth.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:39:36):**  And the difficulty there is that you rarely achieve a durable quality or a really good  
**[0:39:45-0:39:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:39:45):**  result.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:39:46):**  So then you're left with like partial success and something that ultimately ends up becoming  
**[0:39:53-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:39:53):**  non biodegradable aquatic rubbish.  
**[0:39:55-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:39:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:39:56):**  You want to be careful not to contribute to the contamination while trying to eliminate  
**[0:40:00-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:40:00):**  the contamination.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:40:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:40:02):**  And so we really we encourage people to think really carefully about that.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:40:08):**  But I'm a do it yourself for myself, of course, I want to figure out how to make things.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:40:14):**  So you just have to be prepared if you're going to mess around to take stuff out of  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:40:19):**  the water when it doesn't isn't fully successful if you need to.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:40:24):**  And also, I would just strongly discourage people from using any kind of polyurethane  
**[0:40:30-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:40:30):**  or polystyrene foam because it's not particularly non-toxic.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:40:36):**  It does those do leach endocrine interrupters and so forth.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:40:40):**  And also they break up and they're very difficult to recycle.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:40:44):**  So I would discourage from those.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:40:47):**  But natural materials, you know, basically you're just trying to build up an elevation  
**[0:40:54-0:40:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:40:54):**  to get things up to the right level so that you can put plants into them.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:40:58):**  And so once we get to the point where we can start planting these mediums, how do you go  
**[0:41:03-0:41:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:41:03):**  about selecting plants that will be appropriate and will be effective in water remediation?  
**[0:41:09-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:41:09):**  I mean, just go out in the waterway and look what's growing there and check to see that  
**[0:41:14-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:41:14):**  it's native to the region.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:41:16):**  And in general, the more robust the plant is, the more robust its root system is also  
**[0:41:22-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:41:22):**  going to be.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:41:24):**  And it will be able to thrive.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:41:26):**  You know, plants love to grow in situations where they have unlimited nutrients and unlimited  
**[0:41:32-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:41:32):**  water.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:41:33):**  And if you can also put them in a floating ecosystem where they don't get smashed by  
**[0:41:37-0:41:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:41:37):**  flooding every year, you know, because most riparian banks will experience at least some  
**[0:41:43-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:41:43):**  degree of flooding, then they really, really thrive.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:41:49):**  So you know, all the different types of reeds and rushes, sedges, et cetera, they tend to  
**[0:41:55-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:41:55):**  do very well.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:41:57):**  Yeah, it's good to have reference just in the local area, because those are the things  
**[0:42:01-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:42:01):**  that are sort of acclimatized to that.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:42:04):**  And if you start bringing in things perhaps from other climates or different areas, they  
**[0:42:09-0:42:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:42:09):**  could either become invasive or I guess not just not survive the conditions there as well.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:42:17):**  Yeah, it's very important to utilize local plant material where, you know, and definitely  
**[0:42:23-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:42:23):**  not be introducing anything that's invasive or anything.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:42:28):**  And on the really upside, you're harvesting seeds locally from the bioregion or from the  
**[0:42:34-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:42:34):**  same watershed and growing them on and planting them in.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:42:38):**  So at this time of year in the autumn, we've been out and collecting seeds and that will  
**[0:42:45-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:42:45):**  be planted, you know, after Christmas basically at the start of the new year and will provide  
**[0:42:51-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:42:51):**  our local British plant material for some of our projects, particularly we're harvesting  
**[0:42:59-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:42:59):**  at the moment plants for saltwater conditions.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:43:03):**  So we're out in the dunes and gathering some, you know, Angelica and Sea Mallow and things  
**[0:43:10-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:43:10):**  like this that actually you can't even buy if you wanted to and propagating those for  
**[0:43:16-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:43:16):**  our really special projects.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:43:18):**  Hey, that's exciting.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:43:21):**  So up until now, we've been talking about the application of these floating islands  
**[0:43:26-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:43:26):**  in different biological water remediation for streams, rivers, lakes, but you've also  
**[0:43:32-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:43:32):**  pioneered using this as sewage treatment sort of in a contained system.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:43:39):**  Can you talk about how these floating islands can be used in tanks of water in a sequence  
**[0:43:44-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:43:44):**  and in a series to purify sewage without nearly as much, say fossil fuel inputs and using  
**[0:43:52-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:43:52):**  mostly biological systems?  
**[0:43:54-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:43:54):**  Sure.  
**[0:43:55-0:44:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:43:55):**  I mean, basically, on the one hand, you've got activated sludge conventional types of,  
**[0:44:02-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:44:02):**  you know, treatment systems.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:44:03):**  On the other hand, you have very, very natural systems that really are like reed beds, constructed  
**[0:44:10-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:44:10):**  wetlands that use almost no energy and are really wonderful.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:44:16):**  The difficulty with those sometimes is that they're quite area intensive.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:44:23):**  So you very quickly end up with a, you know, to deal with the wastewater from any reasonable  
**[0:44:28-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:44:28):**  size of population, you can quickly end up with a huge area of constructed wetland.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:44:34):**  And if you have the area, that's fantastic.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:44:36):**  Just utilize it.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:44:38):**  But if you don't have the area due to land constraints, et cetera, which often is the  
**[0:44:44-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:44:44):**  case, then there is a middle ground which utilizes some of the aeration and circulation  
**[0:44:51-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:44:51):**  engineering features of an active water treatment system and a lot of the benefits of the natural  
**[0:44:58-0:44:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:44:58):**  system.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:44:59):**  So we call this a helix flow reactor.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:45:02):**  And it's a type of wastewater treatment reactor that basically spirals the water around in  
**[0:45:09-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:45:09):**  the helical pattern, in serpentine pattern through it.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:45:14):**  And we've been really focused on reducing the land area as well as the cost of that  
**[0:45:20-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:45:20):**  system.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:45:21):**  So we utilize a lined lagoon as if it was a constructed wetland, but with the water  
**[0:45:27-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:45:27):**  far, far deeper than you could otherwise establish to grow plants in.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:45:32):**  So typically your constructed wetland would have gravel, et cetera, in it, but we just  
**[0:45:36-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:45:36):**  make very deep water.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:45:38):**  That makes the footprint much, much smaller.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:45:40):**  And then we float the ecosystems on the top and suspend baffles within it to create this  
**[0:45:45-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:45:45):**  serpentine helical flow path.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:45:49):**  And that's a very nice integration between the two systems.  
**[0:45:55-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:45:55):**  And so by harnessing more natural treatment capacity, we're able to extend the hydraulic  
**[0:46:02-0:46:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:46:02):**  retention time and reduce the requirement for aeration, for example.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:46:09):**  Although we do put aeration in as well, it's not as intense as it would need to be.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:46:16):**  And also we're significantly able to reduce the sludge management costs.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:46:21):**  So in conventional wastewater treatment, you're heavily aerating, generating a lot of sludge  
**[0:46:27-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:46:27):**  as quickly as you can because that sludge is what precipitates out of the wastewater  
**[0:46:32-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:46:32):**  and is left with a clarified supernatant, which becomes your treated effluent.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:46:38):**  In a helix flow reactor system, we extend that process slightly so that we allow nature  
**[0:46:45-0:46:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:46:45):**  to do more of the work.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:46:46):**  And also we accumulate the sludge in the bottom for up to a year or more.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:46:53):**  And that allows natural processes to help to break down that sludge, reducing its volume  
**[0:46:58-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:46:58):**  as well.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:47:01):**  That's really remarkable.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:47:02):**  Can you give me an idea of how much space perhaps is needed for a population in order  
**[0:47:10-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:47:10):**  to purify their sewage?  
**[0:47:14-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:47:14):**  So in a constructed wetland type of system, you'd be talking about somewhere between two  
**[0:47:21-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:47:21):**  to five square meters per PE person equivalent of area, typically, depending on temperature  
**[0:47:30-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:47:30):**  and so forth.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:47:32):**  Whereas in a helix flow type of system, you have multiple people per square meter of system.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:47:41):**  Yeah, that's a very drastic difference.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:47:45):**  And have these systems started to be implemented in any notable cities or are there case examples  
**[0:47:53-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:47:53):**  of this working in places that have already kind of had a success story to back them up  
**[0:47:58-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:47:58):**  or is it really just starting to become well known enough to take on the first project?  
**[0:48:07-0:48:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:48:07):**  We have a number of these out there.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:48:08):**  So mostly in industrial sites, distilleries, breweries and so forth.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:48:18):**  And yeah, so they're working well in that regard.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:48:24):**  But those are also quite difficult waters.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:48:28):**  So they have got their own challenges, you know, residual alcohol and stuff in the water.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:48:35):**  The wastewater sector as an industry sector or technology sector is extremely mature and  
**[0:48:44-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:48:44):**  very regulated.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:48:46):**  So it's quite difficult to bring different technologies and different solutions into.  
**[0:48:51-0:48:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:48:51):**  And there's an extremely strong drive for all wastewater to be connected to sewage mains  
**[0:48:58-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:48:58):**  and to go to centralized sewage treatment works.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:49:02):**  And the historic drive for that is really to essentially increase control and management  
**[0:49:09-0:49:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:49:09):**  and improve the effluent quality.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:49:12):**  And so there's not lots of little systems.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:49:14):**  But the downside of that is it makes it much more difficult to regionally or on a district  
**[0:49:22-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:49:22):**  basis reutilize treated effluent within the landscape as a groundwater recharge, non-edible  
**[0:49:30-0:49:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:49:30):**  crop irrigation, etc.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:49:33):**  So we found it, to be honest, quite difficult to crack into the wastewater market.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:49:39):**  And the waterway restoration side of what we've been doing is just so busy.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:49:44):**  We haven't had as much time as we would like to develop that further.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:49:50):**  That's interesting.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:49:51):**  It makes sense.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:49:52):**  But it also brings up the issues of less resilient water treatment systems for municipalities  
**[0:49:58-0:50:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:49:58):**  and bigger risks of single points of failure rather than the decentralized system where  
**[0:50:05-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:50:05):**  perhaps every residential neighborhood could dedicate a certain amount of land to treat  
**[0:50:11-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:50:11):**  their own water and return it back to the system in a way that benefits the residents.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:50:17):**  Tell me, I guess, how people could get into learning more about this and perhaps even  
**[0:50:22-0:50:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:50:22):**  getting to the point where they could start experimenting on a small scale and implementing  
**[0:50:27-0:50:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:50:27):**  some of these projects where they happen to live.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:50:31):**  So most of our projects begin in a really beautiful way where somebody hears about the  
**[0:50:40-0:50:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:50:40):**  work that we're doing, sees before and after pictures, for example, of hard edge and then  
**[0:50:46-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:50:46):**  what it looks like afterwards, full of life and diversity.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:50:50):**  And they realize that there is a hard edge waterway where they live that could benefit  
**[0:50:56-0:50:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:50:56):**  from this type of system.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:50:58):**  So often it's an individual who gets inspired and sees, hey, why can't we do this here?  
**[0:51:06-0:51:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:51:06):**  And we'll get an email or a call or somebody will see something on Instagram or something  
**[0:51:11-0:51:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:51:11):**  and just be like, hey, how come we can't do this here?  
**[0:51:15-0:51:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:51:15):**  And in many cases, it's not somebody with a budget or anything like that and certainly  
**[0:51:22-0:51:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:51:22):**  not a budget for this type of work, but it plants the seed of possibility.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:51:29):**  And from there, we explore options.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:51:33):**  So we look, okay, well, if we wanted to do this here, let's not worry about the funding  
**[0:51:37-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:51:37):**  side of things.  
**[0:51:38-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:51:38):**  Let's just collaborate on the vision for what this waterway could possibly look like.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:51:45):**  And we have a great time just working with people just for fun to see what it could look  
**[0:51:51-0:51:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:51:51):**  like.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:51:52):**  We can watch things out in 3D with plants.  
**[0:51:55-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:51:55):**  We send people KMZ files that they can put directly into Google Earth and zoom around  
**[0:52:01-0:52:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:52:01):**  it and rotate and look at what their waterway could look like with a floating riverbank  
**[0:52:06-0:52:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:52:06):**  along the side of the wall.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:52:07):**  And they can share that with their friends.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:52:10):**  They can share that then with their local regulators and water companies.  
**[0:52:15-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:52:15):**  And pretty soon, it begins to build momentum and interest.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:52:20):**  And then a year, two years down the line, there is some funding potential available  
**[0:52:25-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:52:25):**  and that's really how these projects take off and get rolling.  
**[0:52:31-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:52:31):**  That's fantastic.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:52:32):**  That mirrors a lot the design process that I've worked with and I've known others to  
**[0:52:35-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:52:35):**  do with different restoration projects.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:52:37):**  As you start with the goals and the visioning and from there reverse engineer from what  
**[0:52:44-0:52:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:52:44):**  the ideal outcome could be to get to projects that are feasible to get started and to build  
**[0:52:51-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:52:51):**  momentum towards that end goal.  
**[0:52:54-0:52:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:52:54):**  Can you tell our listeners where they could learn more about the potential of these systems  
**[0:52:59-0:53:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:52:59):**  and waterway restoration and how they can find out more about the company Biomatrix  
**[0:53:05-0:53:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:53:05):**  Water?  
**[0:53:06-0:53:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:53:06):**  Yeah, I mean, a great place obviously is just to go straight to the website and take a look,  
**[0:53:16-0:53:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:53:16):**  BiomatrixWater.com.  
**[0:53:19-0:53:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:53:19):**  My favorite part of the website is actually the news section.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:53:23):**  And if you go to just click on the top headers and go down to news, you'll see all these  
**[0:53:28-0:53:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:53:28):**  different case studies and usually with the video and quotes and pictures and everything  
**[0:53:34-0:53:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:53:34):**  of what we've been up to lately.  
**[0:53:36-0:53:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:53:36):**  And that's a great way just to see what the potential is to get some inspiration.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:53:42):**  That's my favorite part of the website.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:53:45):**  And from there then you can look into different applications and components and so forth.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:53:50):**  But typically people give us a call or send us an email to solutions at BiomatrixWater.com  
**[0:53:57-0:54:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:53:57):**  and then we can explore the different options from there and have a phone call and do a  
**[0:54:04-0:54:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:54:04):**  Google Earth fly through tour and very quickly identify where this potential, where there's  
**[0:54:09-0:54:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:54:09):**  constraints, where there isn't potential.  
**[0:54:12-0:54:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:54:12):**  And that can be a lot of fun just to have a call and look at what the potential is in  
**[0:54:18-0:54:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:54:18):**  your local city.  
**[0:54:20-0:54:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:54:20):**  Excellent.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:54:21):**  Well, for the people listening, I definitely recommend that you reach out and start envisioning  
**[0:54:26-0:54:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:54:26):**  what could happen for your waterway as well.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:54:28):**  And I want to quick give a shout out to Lisa Shaw, your colleague and Art Director of Biomatrix  
**[0:54:33-0:54:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:54:33):**  Water who is a co-instructor on the ecosystem restoration design course that I teach through  
**[0:54:40-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:54:40):**  Gaia Education and Ecosystem Restoration Camps who really turned me on to your work.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:54:45):**  But also the fantastic way that she has communicated the potential of this and illustrated some  
**[0:54:50-0:54:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:54:50):**  of the case studies through her own artwork.  
**[0:54:54-0:55:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:54:54):**  And I know that that adds a really dynamic element to the projects by bringing in the  
**[0:55:00-0:55:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:55:00):**  aesthetics and the community influences as well.  
**[0:55:04-0:55:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:55:04):**  Before you go, can you tell me a little bit about how that has added an extra element  
**[0:55:08-0:55:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:55:08):**  of connection to some of the projects that Biomatrix Water has done?  
**[0:55:14-0:55:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:55:14):**  Well, I think in our core values as people, Lisa and I founders with Michael Shaw and  
**[0:55:27-0:55:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:55:27):**  as a team here, our core value is really about doing things that make the world more beautiful  
**[0:55:33-0:55:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:55:33):**  and healthier.  
**[0:55:34-0:55:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:55:34):**  And so we really enjoy the element, which is creative and artistic.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:55:40):**  And Lisa is a wonderful painter.  
**[0:55:42-0:55:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:55:42):**  And so to bring in that kind of fine art element and then blend that with photography and the  
**[0:55:49-0:55:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:55:49):**  videography and so forth, it just all goes together with our vision of creating it more  
**[0:55:55-0:55:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:55:55):**  beautiful.  
**[0:55:56-0:56:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:55:56):**  And we also see that the beauty also comes in the context of the way that we relate to  
**[0:56:03-0:56:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:56:03):**  each other as people and the way that people relate to the other species on this planet.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:56:08):**  So we also really love and enjoy the interaction with the volunteers and community members  
**[0:56:17-0:56:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:56:17):**  that help bring these projects to the next stage with us.  
**[0:56:21-0:56:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:56:21):**  So we're never really involved in kind of sales type conversations.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:56:26):**  It's really about how do we work together with the tools that we have, with the resources  
**[0:56:31-0:56:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:56:31):**  available to bring waterways to life.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:56:36):**  Those are wonderful words to end on.  
**[0:56:38-0:56:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:56:38):**  Galen, thank you so much for taking the time to explain the details of some of these systems,  
**[0:56:43-0:56:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:56:43):**  the challenges facing our waterways.  
**[0:56:46-0:56:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:56:46):**  And I really look forward to staying in contact and maybe doing a follow up as you continue  
**[0:56:51-0:56:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:56:51):**  to develop the products and the systems that you guys are working on.  
**[0:56:56-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/galen-fulford/#t=0:56:56):**  So thank you.

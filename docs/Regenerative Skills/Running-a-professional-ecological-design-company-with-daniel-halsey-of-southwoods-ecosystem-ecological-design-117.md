**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.

**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:00:29):**  week's episode, so let's jump right in!  
**[0:00:59-0:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:00:59):**  Are you the owner or promotions manager for a regenerative business or organization looking  
**[0:01:05-0:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:01:05):**  to get your message out to a larger audience?  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:01:08):**  Finding your target audience for regenerative products and services can be tough, especially  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:01:12):**  while the movement is still in its infancy and awareness around the importance of ethical  
**[0:01:16-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:01:16):**  business still has a long way to go.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:01:19):**  If you want to tap into a network of informed and motivated people with strong environmental  
**[0:01:23-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:01:23):**  and community ethics who vote with their purchases, then you've come to the right place.

**[0:02:15-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:02:15):**  We look forward to helping you reach your highest potential.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:02:18):**  Alright, welcome everybody.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:02:21):**  One of the most common concerns that I hear from the regenerative community is how someone  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:02:25):**  can make a good living while working directly on projects that regenerate our planet.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:02:30):**  While there are many different ways to do this, it seems that the dominant narrative  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:02:33):**  in business tells us that the most profitable job prospects are those that are destroying  
**[0:02:38-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:02:38):**  our natural world.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:02:40):**  Exploitative petroleum companies post record profits while unethical banking practices  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:02:44):**  pay out massive bonuses and manufacturing covers our landscapes in trash.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:02:49):**  But I know a growing number of people who are pioneering new options for ecological  
**[0:02:53-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:02:53):**  work and making a good wage in the process.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:02:56):**  Now though this is rarely ever the primary motivation to do what they're passionate  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:02:59):**  about, it's important to know that you don't have to compromise a life of holistic abundance  
**[0:03:04-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:03:04):**  to dedicate your time to regenerative work.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:03:07):**  And that's why I'll be focusing in the upcoming weeks on profitable businesses that  
**[0:03:10-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:03:10):**  are doing just that.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:03:12):**  Specifically, I'll be speaking to leaders who are offering solutions to conscious and  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:03:16):**  ecological businesses that help them break through their financial constraints and into  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:03:20):**  profitability in more than just a monetary way.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:03:24):**  To start this series off, I had the pleasure of connecting to a fellow Minnesotan and one  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:03:28):**  of my heroes in ecosystem regeneration, Dan Halsey of Southwoods Ecosystem Ecological  
**[0:03:34-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:03:34):**  Design.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:03:35):**  Now, Dan has worked all over the world as a designer and consultant and has been a co-founder  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:03:39):**  of the Permaculture Research Institute for Cold Climates, the Natural Capital Plant Database,  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:03:45):**  and most recently United Designers Permaculture Design Cooperative.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:03:49):**  With experience working in Central America, Western and Southern Africa, the Iberian Peninsula,  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:03:54):**  and all over North America from Alaska to the Southern mainland, Dan's perspective  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:03:58):**  on patterns and local cultural consideration is truly impressive.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:03):**  Now in this interview, we discussed the implications of the destruction that humans are having  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:07):**  on the planet which stretch far beyond carbon emissions and climate change.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:12):**  Dan also talks about some of the details and observations from his many projects.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:16):**  We then switch to focus on the business aspect of running an ecological design and consultation  
**[0:04:20-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:20):**  firm.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:21):**  Dan and I go over the importance of asking the right questions and how important it is  
**[0:04:25-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:25):**  to have a design criteria list for gathering information and recording observations.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:31):**  We also go over everything from attracting clients, the advantages and challenges of  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:35):**  collaboration, profiles of the organizations that he's helped to start, and much more.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:40):**  Now there's one section of the interview where Dan shares his screen to show me parts of  
**[0:04:44-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:44):**  the functionality of the Natural Capital Plant database that's hard to understand over audio.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:50):**  But I've uploaded the video to the show notes for this episode at AbundantEdge.com so you  
**[0:04:54-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:54):**  can watch and follow along.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:56):**  So definitely grab your notebooks for this one and I'll turn things over to Daniel.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:00):**  Hey Daniel, thank you so much for joining me today.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:03):**  It's such a pleasure to finally connect with you.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:05):**  I've been a fan of your work for a long time.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:07):**  Well, thank you very much.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:08):**  I'm really happy to be here and talk to you about the design process and all the things  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:13):**  going on in permaculture and ecological design.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:15):**  Excellent.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:16):**  Well, yeah, I've got tons of questions that I'd love to ask you.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:19):**  So what do you say we just jump right in?  
**[0:05:21-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:21):**  Sounds great.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:22):**  All right, so Daniel, could you first tell our listeners a little bit about your personal  
**[0:05:25-0:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:25):**  background and how you got inspired to start to work in ecological design?  
**[0:05:31-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:31):**  Right.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:32):**  Well actually, like with most things, I tell people it's kind of following the energy and  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:38):**  following opportunity in life where things go.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:42):**  And my permaculture story, ecological design, like I do now started long time ago, but not  
**[0:05:48-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:48):**  actually in permaculture.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:49):**  I didn't even know about it at the time.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:52):**  So for 25 years, I was a food photographer and package designer doing graphic design,  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:58):**  a lot of food photography, large format back in the analog days, lots of film, then did  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:02):**  digital and that was going quite well.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:07):**  What got me into permaculture was during that time I got sepsis, which is toxic shock.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:13):**  Don't know where it came from.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:14):**  It's kind of a blood infection, really bad news.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:18):**  I didn't know it at the time.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:19):**  I learned a lot about it afterwards because you don't have a lot of time to study something  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:23):**  when you're in the middle of it.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:25):**  So I went in the hospital, lost about 25 pounds in eight days.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:28):**  I was about 35, really good shape though.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:31):**  I was a downhill ski coach.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:32):**  I was like really good shape.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:35):**  Eat that, fortunately, but then had to learn what food was.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:40):**  I was referred to Dr. Kevin Wand, who's a osteopath, homeopath, doctor locally at the  
**[0:06:47-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:47):**  time.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:48):**  The nurse said, you need to talk to this guy.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:50):**  He knows what will fix you up and what you need.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:52):**  I met with him and I learned what food actually was.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:55):**  He said because they give you like Cipro, Ciproflax and all these things to kill off  
**[0:07:00-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:00):**  these bugs, but they also kill off all the good bugs.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:03):**  So his idea was, you know, if you're just starting out, we got to get your digestive  
**[0:07:08-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:08):**  system back, get things going.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:10):**  You first need to learn what food is and you need to start eating better.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:15):**  Cause I was just eating the general popular culture, typical stuff at the time.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:20):**  Like so many of us.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:22):**  And of course I found out what food costs when you start buying good food.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:26):**  That was a big deal.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:27):**  Also.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:28):**  It's like, wow.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:29):**  Go to the natural food store, start buying wholesome foods.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:32):**  And on one hand it's expensive on the other hand, you eat so much less of it because you  
**[0:07:35-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:35):**  don't have to eat so much of it.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:37):**  Um, you're what I found fuller faster.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:40):**  So I started eating better and then I started growing my own food and tomatoes, peppers,  
**[0:07:45-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:45):**  things like that.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:46):**  Things that are easy.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:47):**  I was living in a suburbia and then I met a permaculture person, uh, uh, Paula West  
**[0:07:51-0:07:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:51):**  Morland at the green expo in St Paul.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:54):**  This is about 2003.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:56):**  And what's amazing is I had seen permaculture magazine.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:59):**  I was reading permaculture magazine and then all of a sudden I ran into one other person  
**[0:08:03-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:03):**  who knew what permaculture was.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:05):**  Within a couple of years we had critical mass of about 80 people in PRI cold climate.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:10):**  That's where I learned what permaculture was.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:12):**  Got my PDC, very much got into it.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:15):**  Um, it was excellent.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:17):**  About that time I had an opportunity to buy a little farm, rural hobby farm about 15 miles  
**[0:08:21-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:21):**  away where I'm sitting right now.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:23):**  And I had an excellent opportunity then to exercise all these things I was learning in  
**[0:08:28-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:28):**  permaculture, but I still have my photo studio here.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:31):**  And then in 2006, uh, they were looking for a place for a food forest project.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:35):**  I volunteered and we also had the luck of having Jeff Lawton come for two weeks, uh,  
**[0:08:41-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:41):**  in the County here doing presentations in different areas and then also doing a workshop  
**[0:08:44-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:44):**  here where we put in our food forest.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:47):**  And that was where it kind of all started, uh, in 2006.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:52):**  Now that was great.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:54):**  Photography was great.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:55):**  Everything was going well.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:56):**  Money's coming in.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:57):**  Um, but the thing that got me into ecological design was, uh, for an industry, which was,  
**[0:09:02-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:02):**  I was into marketing, which was just Bulletproof.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:05):**  Uh, as you can imagine, package design, every time the economy changes, packages change,  
**[0:09:10-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:10):**  right?  
**[0:09:11-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:11):**  Atkins in, Atkins out, you name it.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:13):**  So we were doing pretty good until that whole subprime sort of thing happened in 2008, nine,  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:18):**  uh, where everybody was under so much stress, corporations, things like that.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:22):**  My clients were laying off everybody and really the work dried up quickly and I was teaching  
**[0:09:28-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:28):**  photography at a college to bring in some extra cash and they wanted me to get a master's  
**[0:09:32-0:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:32):**  degree in photography after shooting for 25 years.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:35):**  And I said, so I went to the University of Minnesota, was checking that out until I realized,  
**[0:09:39-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:39):**  you know what?  
**[0:09:40-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:40):**  I think I'm going to study horticulture.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:42):**  I think I'm going to go fulfill my permaculture interests and finish up my old bachelor's  
**[0:09:48-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:48):**  from years ago.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:49):**  And then I also, uh, did my master's and my master's program was developing an ecological  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:55):**  design system using permaculture principles and practices for what was being taught as  
**[0:10:00-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:00):**  landscape design.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:02):**  So I took the landscape design courses, which is a lot of, you know, ornamentals and aesthetics,  
**[0:10:06-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:06):**  things like that.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:07):**  And I just flipped it on its head and I put in the new priorities as permaculture would  
**[0:10:10-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:10):**  have it.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:11):**  And that is ecological functions, plant guilds, polycultures, things like that.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:17):**  And that's really where the design process I'm using today came from.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:21):**  And it's of course evolved quite a bit since then.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:24):**  But that was really the process of getting into this was understanding the patterns as  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:28):**  we learned in permaculture in the beginning, kind of seeing the patterns and we'll talk  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:32):**  about this, I'm sure more about the patterns in climate and weather, but really understanding  
**[0:10:36-0:10:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:36):**  that I think I need to move from pop culture, pop business into this more ecological business  
**[0:10:43-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:43):**  and a more ecological lifestyle.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:45):**  And that's what's pretty much supported me since then.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:48):**  You know, we're going basically on 11 years since that big shift.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:52):**  Travel places I never thought I'd ever go.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:54):**  I was a big, you know, big fan of Canada being in Minnesota, you know, five, six years ago.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:59):**  And since then doing ecological design, finding out, wow, this is really important and people  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:04):**  need permaculture principles and ethics all over the world, but they also need ecological  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:09):**  design that's understandable and tailored to their needs.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:13):**  Yeah, and in a way that they can really relate to.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:16):**  And I think it's fantastic that so many of the ways that you got inspired to pursue this  
**[0:11:22-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:22):**  can be related to by so many people.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:24):**  Like you started first by connecting with healthier food and then finding a community  
**[0:11:29-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:29):**  that really supported this, getting connected with other people who knew more.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:33):**  And then when you found opportunities to pursue it more professionally and integrate some  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:37):**  of the skills that you had previously is really when it sounds like it took off for you as  
**[0:11:41-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:41):**  a career path.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:43):**  Right it really did because I had the background of graphic design and the aesthetics that  
**[0:11:48-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:48):**  are required.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:49):**  And I found of course when I was doing package design and food photography, it's about what  
**[0:11:53-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:53):**  we call the easy read.  
**[0:11:56-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:56):**  People need to look at it, know what it is, understand it quickly and it has to be simple.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:59):**  And we have another term that I use a lot, which is called visual noise to reduce the  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:05):**  things that aren't helping the communication and emphasize the things that communicate  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:09):**  better, which sounds simple, but it's actually, you know, it is, can be simple once you know  
**[0:12:13-0:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:13):**  the principles of doing that.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:15):**  So those principles of communicating concepts and communicating principles of a design say  
**[0:12:21-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:21):**  really came from my package design experience and limiting myself to the color palette that  
**[0:12:28-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:28):**  does that.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:29):**  The icons that were very big on now, like with United designers and using Adobe illustrator  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:34):**  to very much simplify our designs, the absolute necessity of information that needs to be  
**[0:12:38-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:38):**  on it and reducing what we call the visual noise.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:41):**  And that's part of my course too is explaining to people and seeing examples of how we can  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:46):**  reduce that because especially with our clients, you know, we may be staring at the same design  
**[0:12:51-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:51):**  for hours and hours and it affects us too.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:54):**  So after a while you don't see anything anymore because you have all this fatigue in your  
**[0:12:57-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:57):**  eyes and we're trying to kind of fix that.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:00):**  So in the process of doing our design, we really reduce the opportunities for your eyes  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:05):**  to have to shift, especially in colors, bright, different colors, things like that.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:09):**  So when we look at, like I'm looking at my little woodland out here, the number of greens  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:13):**  that are out there and browns and tones are actually quite limited and makes it that much  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:18):**  easier to look at as opposed to I was looking at the blues and oranges and you know, there  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:22):**  are blue trees sort of, we call them that, but really in our design work, everything's  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:26):**  a shade of green and earth tones and that really helps people communicate on their level  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:30):**  of what they understand and it makes it easier for them to understand what the design is  
**[0:13:33-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:33):**  all about.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:34):**  Man, I love hearing how people of many different types of disciplines and areas of study find  
**[0:13:40-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:40):**  a way to bring their expertise and their perspectives into these types of regenerative skills that  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:47):**  seemingly wouldn't have a whole lot to do with one another until you find this sort  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:50):**  of creative overlap and it's to me one of the most exciting things about the growing  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:55):**  community that's gotten behind regenerative pursuits.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:59):**  Now you mentioned before about going into some of the details about our climate situation  
**[0:14:05-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:14:05):**  right now.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:14:06):**  I mean it seems fairly well understood by most people who are tuned into any sort of  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:14:11):**  news outlets at all that you know, the rising levels of CO2 are starting to warm the planet,  
**[0:14:16-0:14:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:14:16):**  but when you start to get into it, there are actually much more pressing and extreme manifestations  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:14:23):**  that are not directly related to rises in CO2 levels and I'm talking about things like  
**[0:14:29-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:14:29):**  mass extinction, loss of species and diversity, the habitats and big disruptions in the water  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:14:37):**  cycle that turn into desertification.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:14:40):**  Can you tell me about some of the information that you've gathered in your study and in  
**[0:14:45-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:14:45):**  your practice that really drives home the urgency of some of the other effects of climate  
**[0:14:52-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:14:52):**  change and basically the impact that we're having on our ecology?  
**[0:14:57-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:14:57):**  Sure.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:14:58):**  Well, recently, so we went to the global repair conference that was in Port Townsend, Oregon  
**[0:15:05-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:05):**  or Washington, excuse me, was there and got a chance to talk to some of my friends, people  
**[0:15:10-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:10):**  I've known for a long time and get the details.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:13):**  Tom Gereau was there speaking, he's a PhD from Harvard, he had one of his books back  
**[0:15:18-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:18):**  here, the Geotherapy that I have.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:20):**  He talks about the actual science, the real science about climate change and the responses  
**[0:15:25-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:25):**  of the ecological systems and as we are visual and observation being one of those great things  
**[0:15:31-0:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:31):**  in permaculture, we're looking for patterns, we're making notes of things.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:35):**  If you've seen some of the changes in the species and how they're reacting to the changes  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:39):**  in the ecology, that's what's kind of scary.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:45):**  Over thousands of years of change, species can adapt but it's changing over decades,  
**[0:15:50-0:15:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:50):**  it just doesn't happen, they can't adapt that quickly.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:53):**  So one of the things I noticed, we're working on a project in Poland and here's one example  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:58):**  of how species are adapting and some can be successful that way.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:03):**  So in this Polish estuary, it's quite large, the temperature of the water has changed and  
**[0:16:09-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:09):**  things in the water have changed due to climate change and of course agriculture, things like  
**[0:16:12-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:12):**  that.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:13):**  So a lot of the mussels that were the food for a duck, the greater scop, we call it the  
**[0:16:18-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:18):**  blue bill, goes by other names, but this duck is the deepest diving duck and it eats mussels  
**[0:16:24-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:24):**  and mollusks.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:26):**  And so the zebra mussel is what it was now shifting to.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:31):**  The old food source that it had has basically died off but the invasive zebra mussel had  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:36):**  moved in because it has the warmer weather and now this duck has actually changed its  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:41):**  food from what was and now has gone to a new kind of food source, which is pretty amazing  
**[0:16:46-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:46):**  and very adaptable that they've been able to do that.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:49):**  One thing they found very striking too, I was lucky enough to go to Sitka, Alaska on  
**[0:16:55-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:55):**  a cruise on one of the small research ships for National Geographic.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:58):**  It's kind of a combination research combination of a general cruise, what do you call it,  
**[0:17:03-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:03):**  ecotourism type of thing for about eight days.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:07):**  And some of the things we were learning on that ship, there are about 50 of us and the  
**[0:17:11-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:11):**  naturalists and biologists around there.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:14):**  Other whales, there are two types of orcas, those that eat fish and those that eat meat.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:18):**  I did not know this.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:20):**  And they're different and they're different packs, different pods, things like that.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:24):**  What has been for the first time ever, they've documented that orcas are killing blue whales  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:32):**  or in specifically there's one blue whale.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:35):**  And if you understand how alligators and other animals, turtles sometimes, they'll take their  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:38):**  prey and they'll bury it in the bottom of the ocean or hold it down to go back and get  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:42):**  it later, right, to extend their food source.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:47):**  Orcas were seen to kill a whale and then bring it to the bottom and bury it in the ocean  
**[0:17:52-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:52):**  for later food.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:54):**  That's nothing that's ever been seen before.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:55):**  Is that a situation where now the animals are actually responding to scarcity?  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:01):**  It would seem so.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:02):**  And there are other examples of that where some animals are actually adapting.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:06):**  And as much as we do see, of course, having been by the glaciers and icebergs, that's  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:11):**  just the tip of the iceberg as opposed to what other animals, reptiles, whatever, are  
**[0:18:16-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:16):**  adapting to this change.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:18):**  On the other hand, the release, and I think we owe it to ourselves.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:24):**  And if you haven't seen it, Our Planet by David Attenborough, I think it's on Netflix  
**[0:18:27-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:27):**  and other places.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:29):**  That's an amazing series.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:30):**  Oh my gosh.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:32):**  David Attenborough, he pulls no punches on climate change and what's going on, all the  
**[0:18:36-0:18:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:36):**  different species there.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:38):**  It is hard to watch, but at least we owe it to the walruses at least to watch this video  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:44):**  because the walruses are in total disarray, total chaos because they've lost their ice.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:50):**  They've lost where they actually rest and sun.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:54):**  They're crowded on beaches, hundreds of thousands of them at a time where there's no room for  
**[0:18:59-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:59):**  them.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:00):**  And I won't be a spoiler, but to see what they actually, how they respond and what they  
**[0:19:04-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:04):**  do is just devastating.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:07):**  The fact that they're finding whales beached on like in the German coast, right?  
**[0:19:11-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:11):**  That are basically dyed from plastic.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:13):**  And this came up in our discussions too on the boat is that if you see two, what does  
**[0:19:19-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:19):**  that mean?  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:20):**  If you see two dead whales on an isolated beach somewhere, not all of them beach, right?  
**[0:19:25-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:25):**  How many sank to the bottom?  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:28):**  So every time we see something, you have to realize that, wow, what am I not seeing?  
**[0:19:34-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:34):**  And we're good at that in permaculture.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:36):**  We're looking for these patterns.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:37):**  So if we see these animals responding this way, we need to then open our eyes and look  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:42):**  much closer at all, whether it's bees, butterflies, birds, all those kinds of things, what's going  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:48):**  on because these patterns are very important to us to understand what's going on even for  
**[0:19:53-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:53):**  our own survival.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:54):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:55):**  These larger patterns are key to understanding how we can interact in a way or start to reverse  
**[0:20:01-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:01):**  some of the damage that's been done.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:04):**  But it also relates specifically into the way that we as designers and one of my favorite  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:11):**  things about the content that you put out there and the message is integrating this  
**[0:20:16-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:16):**  in with a holistic system as a design business.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:20):**  Let's talk now about raising the standard specifically for design and what are some  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:26):**  of the most notable challenges that you see other ecological designers facing?  
**[0:20:31-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:31):**  Right.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:32):**  So in the US, it's fairly straightforward.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:36):**  If you want information, you can find it.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:39):**  A lot of the data that we need in order to do our base maps, our site assessments, things  
**[0:20:43-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:43):**  like that, we have an eight page data table right now.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:45):**  We call it reunited designers that we share, which are basically, it's a word doc with  
**[0:20:51-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:51):**  four columns.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:52):**  One is here are the questions.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:54):**  Here's where you find the answers.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:55):**  The third one is where you put the answers and the fourth one is recommendations.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:58):**  There's eight pages of this data.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:01):**  And the biggest problem I think that we have, especially in design, is knowing what the  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:05):**  questions are.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:07):**  And if you don't know what to do, you haven't asked enough questions.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:11):**  So knowing what the questions are, getting the answers for those gives our subconscious  
**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:16):**  the time and the ability to come up with the solutions.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:20):**  And that's where insight comes in the design.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:22):**  You have to read tons and tons of information, all sorts of things.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:26):**  It's like I learned, like an art school.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:29):**  Learn everything, then forget it.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:31):**  Just learn, forget it because it'll still be back there working its way in your subconscious.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:35):**  And when you need a solution, that insight will come forward.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:39):**  So get in the information, knowing what the questions are, and then also having a very  
**[0:21:44-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:44):**  specific process.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:45):**  So we have a process list.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:47):**  It's like three pages, chronological, all the things we have to do in order to get the  
**[0:21:52-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:52):**  information starting with the base map, the data table, client interviews, things like  
**[0:21:56-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:56):**  that.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:57):**  And even if the information doesn't apply when I'm in the Southwest or like Southern  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:00):**  Texas and we're looking for growing degree days and then we're looking for chilling days  
**[0:22:05-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:05):**  for apple fruit and things like that, well, it really, chilling days in Southern Texas,  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:11):**  well, still we want to find that information because it might be important.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:15):**  And even these things that we think aren't really important, if it exists somewhere,  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:18):**  we get it in there because it really kind of sculpts the environment for us and gives  
**[0:22:23-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:23):**  us an idea of what we're working with.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:26):**  So a real challenge here is still getting the data, getting it organized, doing a very  
**[0:22:31-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:31):**  good base map, doing all the testing.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:34):**  And then also, it's funny, a lot of challenges I could list, remembering that you have to  
**[0:22:39-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:39):**  go in with a sense of awe and ignorance.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:41):**  And that's really true.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:44):**  I have to go into my jobs with nothing in my tool belt, right?  
**[0:22:48-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:48):**  Nothing ready to go, no preconceived notions.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:50):**  And that's actually very freeing to go to some other country or some other state and  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:56):**  you have to just wipe your brain out and start doing the research and know that your solutions  
**[0:23:01-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:01):**  have to apply to that place.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:03):**  Not everybody needs a Berman swale.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:05):**  Actually very few places I've worked on have done Berman swales, right?  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:09):**  Not every place needs to be key lined, but that's something that needs to be assessed.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:13):**  And if it comes up, absolutely.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:15):**  Now when you do those systems, any of these tools that we have in permaculture and design,  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:19):**  it has to be tailored exactly to that place, exactly to the slope, the aspect, the type  
**[0:23:24-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:24):**  of soil that's there.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:25):**  There is no one thing that you do everywhere the same way.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:30):**  Everything needs to be tailored just because, just like the clothing you're going to wear,  
**[0:23:33-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:33):**  just like the seasons.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:34):**  Everything changes and we need to adapt the design to that.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:37):**  So having all these documents and it takes some time.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:41):**  I just got back from Albuquerque yesterday, five days there, working on a restaurant that  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:46):**  has a farm attached to it, which is really, really great opportunities there.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:51):**  But we have to be really careful with the kind of soils they have and the integration  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:55):**  that they have with their customers that actually are walking out on the farm, the perception  
**[0:23:59-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:59):**  of what's going on in the farm and also the difference between production systems and  
**[0:24:04-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:04):**  like the polycultures and ecological systems.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:07):**  Somehow we do a blend in there.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:08):**  Of course, permaculture works great for that.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:10):**  We're a combination of production, agriculture, and the ecological systems which support that.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:16):**  We try to bring those two things together.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:18):**  So getting overwhelmed is a big problem with these jobs.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:23):**  Just like everybody else, it might be two in the morning, you'll wake up and go, what  
**[0:24:27-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:27):**  have I just got myself into?  
**[0:24:30-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:30):**  That's happened a couple of times.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:32):**  But I know if you have a process and you have a list of questions, and I have to do it every  
**[0:24:36-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:36):**  time to remind myself, hit that list.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:40):**  And the last thing I'll say is-  
**[0:24:41-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:41):**  Yeah, there's no shortcuts.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:42):**  There really isn't.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:44):**  You're going to really get yourself in a situation if you try to jump anything or make any kind  
**[0:24:49-0:24:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:49):**  of assumptions.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:50):**  And you have to dig holes.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:51):**  You have to do a lot of research on the land because just because what you're seeing on  
**[0:24:55-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:55):**  the surface may not be what it's down deep.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:57):**  I have a couple of examples of that I can tell you about where, well, we see sand.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:02):**  So obviously, the water is just going to infiltrate really fast until the wind blows.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:06):**  And we found that about three inches under that sand is compacted sand.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:10):**  It was like concrete.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:11):**  They had a hard pan in a sand field, which was just amazing.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:14):**  And so that's another thing we had to think about with working.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:18):**  So understanding all the systems, getting your list down and following that.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:24):**  And what we also have is now, because I teach this as a graduate class at the University  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:28):**  of Minnesota, it's a 15 week semester.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:31):**  We have a rubric for that, which is basically these are all the expectations for the design.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:36):**  So we took the design process with all the items on there and we turned it into an Excel  
**[0:25:40-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:40):**  spreadsheet and you guys go through and you've got to check off each one of those.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:44):**  And as you can imagine, it's getting bigger and bigger and bigger as we add more details.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:49):**  Like when you get into soil sciences and soil tests, all that information that we want to  
**[0:25:53-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:53):**  find out or make sure we at least looked at it.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:56):**  Now I've become obsessed with something that you mentioned earlier, and that's the questions  
**[0:26:00-0:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:00):**  that you ask during the design process.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:03):**  Not only doing interviews like this one through the podcast, but also working directly with  
**[0:26:07-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:07):**  clients to help identify their needs, the conditions and the parameters that we're working  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:12):**  with.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:13):**  And I've noticed that the questions that you ask really frame the information that you're  
**[0:26:18-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:18):**  going to gather.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:19):**  And though you may be looking for the same things, if you ask the same question, even  
**[0:26:23-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:23):**  just in a slightly different way, it can really change the way that that information is conveyed  
**[0:26:29-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:29):**  or gathered.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:30):**  And so my question to you is what are some of the main questions?  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:33):**  I know you said you've got a document available online to go through all of this, but among  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:37):**  that list, what are some of the questions that have been most impactful or changed the  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:42):**  perspective or the way that you gather information?  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:47):**  Well in many cases, like I was saying in the United States, we go online and we can find  
**[0:26:52-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:52):**  anything we want.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:54):**  That is not true as most things in the rest of the world.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:58):**  Some of the insight I got, I was working with Neil Bertrando and we were actually in Senegal  
**[0:27:03-0:27:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:03):**  and I said, you know, Neil, I think we're the anomaly.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:06):**  Everywhere I'm going in the world seems to be much more similar than we to themselves  
**[0:27:10-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:10):**  than to us.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:13):**  Everywhere else in the world is much more similar in their agriculture, their building,  
**[0:27:16-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:16):**  their structures, things like that, especially.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:17):**  Yeah, that's been true in my experience for sure.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:20):**  And where are the strange ones?  
**[0:27:21-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:21):**  Where are the odd?  
**[0:27:22-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:22):**  And so there comes to kind of a lot of, oh, you might say, I have this whole thing about  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:29):**  being a perpetrator in some of the things going on, but I'm also trying to figure out,  
**[0:27:33-0:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:33):**  okay, I'm a perpetrator, but I'm also trying to fix this.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:35):**  How do I balance these things living as I do where I live, trying not to have the effect  
**[0:27:40-0:27:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:40):**  on the rest of the world.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:41):**  But anyway, we have great resources here.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:44):**  You go to another country, you go to a place like we were in Senegal, there are no schools,  
**[0:27:50-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:50):**  there is no written language where we're working.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:53):**  How do you get the information that you need to get?  
**[0:27:57-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:57):**  So that you just start having conversations and you ask questions.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:01):**  And when we were teaching a class there last fall through Matter, which is a Matter organization,  
**[0:28:08-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:08):**  which is in the Twin Cities, it's an NGO.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:10):**  We did a class there on Gorgie Jeng's farm.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:13):**  He's actually an NBA basketball player for the Timberwolves.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:16):**  He has a farm in Senegal.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:17):**  So we did a class there at his agricultural center for four days, but the class was not  
**[0:28:20-0:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:20):**  about teaching.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:21):**  It was about finding out and discovery.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:24):**  So we have to ask questions in context.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:28):**  It's not about, okay, you're going to ask them what the nitrogen is, what's the organic  
**[0:28:32-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:32):**  material in your soil, are you going to do anything?  
**[0:28:34-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:34):**  No.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:35):**  You actually first have to find out what do they think soil is.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:38):**  How are they acting, what are they working, and work basically from their context, not  
**[0:28:42-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:42):**  from ours.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:43):**  And so the whole beginning of that four day course was asking questions about what was  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:47):**  it 30 years ago, 20 years ago, what were you growing then?  
**[0:28:51-0:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:51):**  And we got a great response from people, and then asking them about different parts of  
**[0:28:54-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:54):**  the country, and what do they do there, and how does that work?  
**[0:28:57-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:57):**  And after a while, they start seeing the patterns.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:00):**  We're just giving terminology to the patterns that they already know.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:03):**  This is already information that they have.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:05):**  When we were in Haiti, we found an old chalkboard, and we were working there.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:11):**  And the first thing we did, we found an old chalkboard, all busted up, laid it on the  
**[0:29:13-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:13):**  floor, found some chalk, and we asked the people to draw.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:17):**  Who's here who's a good artist?  
**[0:29:19-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:19):**  Draw Haiti the best that you can.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:22):**  Where are the mountains?  
**[0:29:23-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:23):**  Where are the rivers?  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:24):**  And they were basically teaching themselves and us what's going on in the island there.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:29):**  And then where do things grow?  
**[0:29:30-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:30):**  Why did they grow there?  
**[0:29:32-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:32):**  Where do the winds come from?  
**[0:29:33-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:33):**  Where do the storms come from?  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:34):**  And just like we're doing a sector map, we had this big chalkboard filled with all sorts  
**[0:29:38-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:38):**  of drawings and arrows and everything.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:40):**  And the people that knew the information were teaching it to the people that didn't know.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:44):**  And then of course, they're arguing about different things, and about the rivers, and  
**[0:29:47-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:47):**  the fish, and things like that.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:49):**  But at the same time, we're getting informed as to what's going on in the climate, and  
**[0:29:53-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:53):**  what's going on with the agriculture.  
**[0:29:56-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:56):**  We were in Haiti also at a different time.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:59):**  We were learning about some citrus disease that they had, and what was going on with  
**[0:30:03-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:03):**  the trees, and trying to figure out what that problem was.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:06):**  And through the translators and through people that spoke English also in French, finding  
**[0:30:09-0:30:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:09):**  out, oh, okay, what was the pattern?  
**[0:30:12-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:12):**  How did it work?  
**[0:30:13-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:13):**  And eventually, of course, they couldn't deal with it.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:15):**  They didn't have the resource to do it, so they had to pull all their trees out.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:19):**  We're taking that information, then we come back to the United States, and we ask people  
**[0:30:22-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:22):**  that know these things, so that we can go back and inform them.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:26):**  So it's all about asking questions all the time.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:29):**  Now, what those questions are have to be tailored, of course, basically to the education of the  
**[0:30:34-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:34):**  people who are there.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:35):**  And you might have to do some education first before they can answer the questions.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:40):**  On the other hand, I've been so amazed.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:42):**  You go to these countries that some people call illiterate, which bugs me, or third world  
**[0:30:46-0:30:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:46):**  or developing, which also bugs me.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:49):**  You go there and ask them, and they know everything about the plants.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:52):**  Which one is used for toothaches?  
**[0:30:53-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:53):**  Which one is done for this?  
**[0:30:55-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:55):**  We were going through a woodland area, and everybody is grabbing leaves and nuts and  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:58):**  berries as we're going through this area, because they're all collecting and foraging  
**[0:31:03-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:03):**  for all these material, because they all know what it works.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:06):**  So if they have all this indigenous knowledge, what are we there for?  
**[0:31:09-0:31:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:09):**  Right?  
**[0:31:10-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:10):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:11):**  We're just there to help them and answer their questions.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:15):**  What else can we do?  
**[0:31:16-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:16):**  Let's look at the soil here.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:18):**  The four day class that we did in Senegal, the only thing we were teaching them over  
**[0:31:23-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:23):**  that four days for them to decide, of course, was soil temperature, the depth and type of  
**[0:31:29-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:29):**  soil they have, and the benefits of mulching.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:32):**  That's the only thing that we got out of that four days.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:35):**  But that was stellar, because they decided through the demonstrations that we did, the  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:40):**  little trials that we did, different ways of watering, digging holes, and all of a sudden  
**[0:31:45-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:45):**  they were saying, oh yeah, we need to do this.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:47):**  That makes so much sense.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:50):**  And so we're not preaching anything.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:52):**  We're all discovering it at the same time, and I think that's much more effective.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:55):**  Of course, when it's their decision and a few of them will adopt it, it's probably more  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:59):**  likely that they'll adopt it than us coming and saying, here, spend a ton more calories  
**[0:32:03-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:03):**  doing it this way.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:04):**  You should get something better.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:06):**  It's not how it really works in a lot of these countries.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:08):**  Everybody has to spend the calories and risk all that energy in order to get the benefit.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:13):**  That is such an important observation, especially when working with cultures that are not your  
**[0:32:19-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:19):**  original ones, or when you're going into another environment or context.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:23):**  There is this sort of pervasive stereotype of people going in and acting as sort of saviors  
**[0:32:30-0:32:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:30):**  or bringing people out of what we consider to be underdeveloped.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:33):**  And I'm equally perturbed by those terms that you mentioned earlier, underdeveloped, or  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:38):**  third world, or things like that, because the knowledge is definitely there.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:43):**  It's possibly just not the knowledge that we have traditionally prioritized or given  
**[0:32:48-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:48):**  value to in our culture.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:50):**  And let's be honest, so many aspects of our culture and the way that we have started to  
**[0:32:54-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:54):**  domineer our environments are the reason why these overarching defects and disconnection  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:33:00):**  to natural systems are pervasive all around the world.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:33:04):**  And many times the perspectives that we have to offer are just relating the indigenous  
**[0:33:10-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:33:10):**  knowledge, the connection to nature that they inherently have, and are frankly much stronger  
**[0:33:16-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:33:16):**  than we have in this part of the overdeveloped world, as we call the global West, is relating  
**[0:33:22-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:33:22):**  it to these sort of unhealthy economic models that would allow them to participate and remove  
**[0:33:29-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:33:29):**  themselves further from the connection that they have, which is much better than ours.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:33:34):**  And I'm very glad that you mentioned this.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:33:37):**  It's a co-learning experience.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:33:39):**  And if both parties come into it hoping to share and to ask the questions that allow  
**[0:33:46-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:33:46):**  the discovery from the addition of information and perspectives that each side brings, I  
**[0:33:52-0:33:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:33:52):**  have certainly found in my experience that that creates a much more lasting effect and  
**[0:33:57-0:34:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:33:57):**  much more likely that the conclusions come out of those interactions are actually going  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:02):**  to be implemented rather than, as I've seen in so many other places, especially with NGO  
**[0:34:07-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:07):**  and nonprofit models, when projects are implemented or kind of forced upon the people where you're  
**[0:34:14-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:14):**  working, as soon as the funding or the support of the maintenance from outside dries up,  
**[0:34:19-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:19):**  the projects are abandoned because they were not initiated by the people who they actually  
**[0:34:23-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:23):**  affect.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:24):**  There's many, many, many examples of that in every country.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:29):**  Reports that were put in, people paid to put them in, as soon as the trees were even harvestable,  
**[0:34:35-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:35):**  they got harvested and they weren't taken care of.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:36):**  Why?  
**[0:34:37-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:37):**  Because nobody was paid to take care of them.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:39):**  And that was the logic.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:41):**  So and kind of to extend to what you're saying too, so there is indigenous knowledge, there's  
**[0:34:46-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:46):**  local knowledge and cultural knowledge.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:48):**  That's great.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:49):**  All of that is passed down.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:51):**  The great thing about it is it doesn't change.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:54):**  Knowledge of plants, how they grow, what they look like for the most part, that's what's  
**[0:34:59-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:59):**  great about horticulture and permaculture is that the way this oak tree grows now is  
**[0:35:03-0:35:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:03):**  the way it's always grown and probably will always grow relative to where it's located  
**[0:35:07-0:35:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:07):**  in a climate or its environment.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:10):**  So you have the cultural practices though, that's where we run into problems.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:14):**  And that's here in the United States too.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:16):**  Cultural practices are basically like traditional practices where we've always done it this  
**[0:35:21-0:35:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:21):**  way.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:22):**  We don't want to mess with it because this is what has worked.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:26):**  And I had this conversation earlier in the week and I've had it in many places where  
**[0:35:31-0:35:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:31):**  people want to put in native plants.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:33):**  This is my example.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:34):**  In one place I was working, native plants was the key.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:37):**  We just want to do native plants.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:38):**  I said, great, sounds wonderful.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:40):**  Love it, love it, love it.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:41):**  Show me a native soil.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:43):**  Show me the actual ecology that existed when that native plant was here.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:47):**  If that's gone, you're not going to have the native plants that existed.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:51):**  This whole soil regime, this whole ecology has changed.  
**[0:35:55-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:55):**  If you want to get that back, we have to work on the functional plants with ecological functions  
**[0:36:00-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:00):**  that can help bring that soil back so you can have those natives back if you want.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:04):**  Otherwise, the slate is different.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:06):**  The ecology is different.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:07):**  And so we have to start differently.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:09):**  And it's the same thing with farming.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:11):**  Now I'm apt to read a lot more about this, but I was just in Albuquerque and in these  
**[0:36:15-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:15):**  fields off the Rio Grande, they do flood irrigation.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:19):**  And I went out there when I arrived with my penetrometer.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:22):**  It tells you how many square, psi, pounds per square inch it takes to push through the  
**[0:36:27-0:36:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:27):**  soil.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:28):**  And at a certain psi, it won't go through and that tells you when you have compaction.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:32):**  So you push this down the soil.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:34):**  You can hear it, you can feel it, and you can even see it on the rod when it comes out  
**[0:36:37-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:37):**  of the ground, what's going on underground with that.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:40):**  So I go out in this field and it's like concrete.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:43):**  I can't put it on.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:44):**  And then they're going to come the next day I hear and flood irrigate this huge field.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:47):**  They just turn open these big manhole covers and the water just comes out because it's  
**[0:36:52-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:52):**  natural water pressure from the canals, from the Rio Grande.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:56):**  And by the way, this is a 300 year old system that the Spanish started.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:00):**  And that history right there would be worth a lot of reading and study.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:04):**  So anyway, this very old system, they have people that this was the first, you might  
**[0:37:08-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:08):**  say governance in the whole United States was governing the water system in the Rio  
**[0:37:12-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:12):**  Grande Valley here, where Albuquerque and what it was, all the different towns that  
**[0:37:16-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:16):**  were down there.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:17):**  So anyway, they flood irrigate this and I'm thinking, okay, from everything I've ever  
**[0:37:21-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:21):**  heard flood irrigation is bad.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:23):**  We tried to stop that in Haiti.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:25):**  We're trying to stop this in other areas by doing channeling, by doing drip irrigation,  
**[0:37:29-0:37:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:29):**  by doing spot watering, things like that because flood irrigation just isn't going to work.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:34):**  So they flood irrigate it and I'm thinking, wow, there's like four or five inches of water  
**[0:37:38-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:38):**  on this field.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:39):**  Tomorrow, there's going to be three or four inches of water in this field.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:42):**  And I don't know what's going on with this.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:44):**  I think I'm saying, I'm questioning this a lot to myself and a little bit with my client  
**[0:37:49-0:37:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:49):**  saying, I'm not quite sure this is the way to go.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:51):**  So anyway, I go out the next day, all the water is gone, absolutely gone.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:55):**  I take the penetrometer, it goes three feet into the ground like butter.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:59):**  It was just amazing.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:00):**  And then I pull it out and it's actually cold from all the water that infiltrated.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:05):**  So the soil type that they have there, which is a sandy loam, that crust on the top was  
**[0:38:10-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:10):**  really very, very hard.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:12):**  But as soon as the water hit it, it seems like all that water just infiltrated, and  
**[0:38:15-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:15):**  this was an alfalfa field, infiltrated very deep.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:19):**  So I'm going to have to really look at that because, of course, not wanting to judge on  
**[0:38:23-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:23):**  anything and not having to be, okay, absolutely flood irrigation is bad.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:27):**  Now all of a sudden it's like, wow, this is amazing.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:30):**  Simple energy, gravity fed about once or twice a month, they get allowed to flood this field  
**[0:38:35-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:35):**  and the water just goes way into the ground.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:38):**  So there's something about this.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:39):**  Because I was thinking, wow, we're going to have to do a subsoiler key lining on here,  
**[0:38:44-0:38:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:44):**  something to get the water in the ground.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:45):**  And I was totally off base in my assumptions in that point.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:49):**  So there is a cultural practice that's been going on for hundreds of years that I was  
**[0:38:53-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:53):**  questioning.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:54):**  But in the sense it's like, wow, this is amazing.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:56):**  So now I have to rethink flood irrigation and what is the situation that you have to  
**[0:39:01-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:01):**  be careful of.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:02):**  Now if that was heavy clay, like we were in Haiti, that's an issue because the clay comes  
**[0:39:08-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:08):**  to the top.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:09):**  It just really is not really good for the soil.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:12):**  But for this silty loam, sandy loam, it actually worked perfectly.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:16):**  And I was very impressed with that.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:18):**  So cultural practices as opposed to cultural knowledge, sometimes things are done because  
**[0:39:24-0:39:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:24):**  they've always been done.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:25):**  And cultural practices are kind of the hardest thing to change.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:28):**  But it takes one or two people to take the calories and the energy to do it and try it.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:33):**  And if all of a sudden they succeed, then everybody will be on it.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:38):**  Everybody's watching everybody else in every country, every little village that you're  
**[0:39:41-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:41):**  in.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:42):**  So that's the thing we want to change.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:43):**  But we also have to watch.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:44):**  And I think, and I've said this in Haiti too, you kind of have to be there.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:48):**  And I would think you have to be there for like a year, a whole year or a number of seasons  
**[0:39:53-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:53):**  to see how things work.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:54):**  You can't just go there for a couple of weeks and judge stuff.  
**[0:39:57-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:57):**  And that's very difficult.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:58):**  Bill Mollison would say that you buy a property, sit on it for a year and watch and observe  
**[0:40:03-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:03):**  everything.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:04):**  So that's hard part with the designing too is I've got maybe three months to get ready,  
**[0:40:10-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:10):**  a couple of months to get ready to go do my research and maybe two weeks there to do it.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:14):**  I wish I could be there for a year in every place and just live it and see what's going  
**[0:40:18-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:18):**  on and then be much more informed and probably much more accepted too.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:22):**  I love stories like that, especially since like it's very difficult to accept the humility  
**[0:40:28-0:40:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:28):**  that those types of realizations bring.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:31):**  But just like you said, like the intricacies, the nuances of nature are constantly surprising  
**[0:40:38-0:40:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:38):**  me as well, just like you mentioned.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:40):**  And there's never an end to what you can learn or understand or the assumptions that you  
**[0:40:46-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:46):**  can break when you really observe and take the time.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:49):**  And I mean, it's really helped me come to some personal conclusions because I've been  
**[0:40:54-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:54):**  designing and consulting with clients and projects around the world myself and had much  
**[0:40:59-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:59):**  like you, like sort of limited times to interact with the communities and the ecosystems in  
**[0:41:04-0:41:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:04):**  which I've been called in to work on.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:07):**  And it's really helped me to realize that I would be much more effective as a participant  
**[0:41:13-0:41:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:13):**  in these projects, as a contributor in the long term, if I really want to see any solutions  
**[0:41:19-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:19):**  come.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:20):**  And it's not really supported by the angle in which a lot of work is promoted right now,  
**[0:41:28-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:28):**  where you bring someone in, you find solutions, you implement them and then you leave.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:33):**  But especially when you're working with living systems like this, dynamic systems, it's a  
**[0:41:37-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:37):**  participation, it's a co-evolution.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:40):**  And it's really brought me to think that I need to change the approach that I've had  
**[0:41:45-0:41:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:45):**  over the years, because I've been fortunate that some of my recommendations and designs  
**[0:41:49-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:49):**  have worked as well as they have.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:51):**  But it's almost at this point in my understanding, a matter of luck.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:56):**  And it's so much to the credit of the people who work on it for the longer term, rather  
**[0:42:01-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:01):**  than my own knowledge or understanding of something, because I've made just as large  
**[0:42:05-0:42:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:05):**  of mistakes having assumptions or coming in with preconceived notions like you mentioned  
**[0:42:10-0:42:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:10):**  before.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:11):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:12):**  Well, a funny example is to talk about humility.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:15):**  When Neil and I were in Senegal, we were doing the banana circles because they have these  
**[0:42:19-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:19):**  sheds, the water is coming off.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:21):**  When it does wane, we're trying to direct it to these banana circles and things like  
**[0:42:25-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:25):**  that.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:26):**  So we're digging them, putting organic material in and making them, kind of sculpting the  
**[0:42:29-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:29):**  land to do it.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:30):**  The guys got it.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:31):**  They figured out what we were doing.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:32):**  We came back six months later and they had torn out everything that we had put in and  
**[0:42:37-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:37):**  put in their own stuff, which was just great.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:39):**  They had papayas going and they had a cotter saw, a sour sop, all these other things going  
**[0:42:44-0:42:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:44):**  in this system.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:45):**  And it's like, it's a structure.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:47):**  It still works.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:48):**  They just decided they wanted to grow something else.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:51):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:52):**  Maybe we just didn't ask enough questions.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:54):**  They understood the system and yes, it was working.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:56):**  The water was going in these holes there, the pits, organic material was there.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:01):**  Are we putting in some manure that they're finding?  
**[0:43:03-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:03):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:04):**  So you have to allow these people, wherever you go, these people, your clients, your customers,  
**[0:43:11-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:11):**  you're advocating for them.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:12):**  You have to let them put their spin on it and either fail or adjust it however they  
**[0:43:17-0:43:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:17):**  want so they can experiment and learn themselves.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:21):**  A lot of this, it is all about education and understanding the variabilities.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:27):**  I'm getting educated every time I do a project.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:30):**  I'm trying to educate people and here's what I've seen.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:32):**  Here are the stories from these different places, but you have to give people in every  
**[0:43:35-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:35):**  situation that opportunity to learn, decide, and to see what the variabilities are so they  
**[0:43:42-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:42):**  can basically take ownership of it and not just us coming in and saying, look, I saw  
**[0:43:46-0:43:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:46):**  this in a book.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:47):**  We're going to do this cause it was in this book, right?  
**[0:43:50-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:50):**  They saw the structure and they say, Oh, I see how this works, but I'm going to grow  
**[0:43:52-0:43:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:52):**  something different, which is absolutely the best way to go.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:56):**  And so with that observation, what do you think most designers in, in your observation  
**[0:44:01-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:01):**  or your experience sort of missing when creating functional designs that truly meet the needs  
**[0:44:05-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:05):**  of a piece of land and its owners or stewards?  
**[0:44:09-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:09):**  Wow.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:11):**  Missing.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:13):**  So my, I have limited experience, you might say, with seeing other people's work.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:19):**  I have to be honest.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:20):**  I try to keep up with things, social media, Facebook, all that kind of stuff that's going  
**[0:44:24-0:44:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:24):**  on.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:25):**  I don't see enough longterm, you know, you see when it first goes in, Hey, here's our  
**[0:44:29-0:44:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:29):**  food forest.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:30):**  The first six months, you never see anything again.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:34):**  Stroud bale houses, things like that.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:36):**  You see everything going in, but you don't actually get to see it five, 10 years later.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:40):**  Some of it obviously is very new.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:43):**  So there are a couple of things that was missing that were missing for me.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:49):**  And this is when I started getting into ecological restoration with John Liu, ecosystem restoration  
**[0:44:54-0:44:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:54):**  programs, things like that was what they're calling the four returns from common land.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:59):**  So, and I thought that was very important when we're doing this ecological design on  
**[0:45:03-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:03):**  the properties, right?  
**[0:45:05-0:45:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:05):**  Is that there has to be much more than just the harvest.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:09):**  There also needs to be some kind of economic benefit from them, especially wherever they  
**[0:45:14-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:14):**  are.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:15):**  Not everybody can make your own shoes and clothing.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:18):**  They're going to have to buy something.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:19):**  So there is some kind of economic system.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:21):**  So as much as there's subsistence in all of this, which we really want, they also have  
**[0:45:25-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:25):**  to have something of value that they can, so they can be part of the economic system  
**[0:45:29-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:29):**  locally in their village or in the region so they can get their needs met that way.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:35):**  So there also has to be a social aspect to it.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:38):**  And that comes with, I think, creativity and change and talking to people.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:42):**  And that's about organizing everybody.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:45):**  Mark Bayruthy from Lebanon works with people in Lebanon and building farmer co-ops.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:49):**  And he was actually with us in Senegal for the class explaining how the co-ops work with  
**[0:45:54-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:54):**  the farmers in Lebanon.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:55):**  And it was really fascinating coming together.  
**[0:45:57-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:57):**  These are our crops.  
**[0:45:58-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:58):**  This is what we're growing.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:59):**  How can we do this together for standards of quality and things like that, and then  
**[0:46:04-0:46:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:04):**  find a market so that we all can work together.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:07):**  So that kind of social bond of farmers working together, subsistence farmers or whatever,  
**[0:46:12-0:46:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:12):**  that's very important.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:13):**  And that also needs to be worked into our designs.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:15):**  How does it work with the whole community?  
**[0:46:18-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:18):**  Are there more people that can get involved with this?  
**[0:46:21-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:21):**  There's the spiritual side of this also.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:24):**  And then of course there's the ecological benefit of growing systems or basically growing  
**[0:46:28-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:28):**  food.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:29):**  And like I like to say, I have our main points and I might say we have a lot of main points,  
**[0:46:33-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:33):**  but one of them is we're always trying to build the natural capital.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:37):**  That's a big word phrase for me, right?  
**[0:46:39-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:39):**  The soils need to be better.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:41):**  The nutrients need to be better.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:42):**  The water needs to be held better in the soil.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:45):**  Everything needs to improve by building the natural capital because that's the actual  
**[0:46:48-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:48):**  wealth of land is all the nutrients and the ecological systems on it and its ability to  
**[0:46:54-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:54):**  carry food or carry animals, which brings us to the carrying capacity.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:00):**  That term is used.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:01):**  It's called decay in biological terms, but there's a carrying capacity to every ecological  
**[0:47:05-0:47:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:05):**  system.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:06):**  As we raise the natural capital, boom, boom, boom, carrying capacity goes up.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:11):**  Richer soils holds more water, bigger harvest.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:14):**  More harvest, more organic material, better soils, bigger harvest.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:18):**  More animals can go on this pasture now because we keep building more soil.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:22):**  We raise the natural capital.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:23):**  We improve the soil, the nutrient load on that, maybe better plants, different plant  
**[0:47:28-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:28):**  seeds, things like that for the cattle.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:30):**  So raising the natural capital means raising the carrying capacity.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:34):**  And that's a big part of the design is an expectation that when we leave or when they  
**[0:47:39-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:39):**  start putting in the design, like with permaculture in general, it doesn't take a lot of interest.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:44):**  It needs inputs, but it needs to constantly be regenerating.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:48):**  Or like Alana Bliss was saying the other day, just generating, right?  
**[0:47:52-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:52):**  Maybe not regenerative, but just generative.  
**[0:47:54-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:54):**  It just needs to generate constantly.  
**[0:47:57-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:57):**  Nutrient cycles like every forest does, every jungle, everywhere in the tropics, even in  
**[0:48:01-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:01):**  the desert, things build and build over time at different rates.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:05):**  So that's what our designs need to make sure that we have is a nutrient cycling system  
**[0:48:10-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:10):**  that's inherent in the design so that the soils are better every year.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:15):**  The water holding capacity is better every year.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:17):**  And then the animals and the health of the, of the property is better every year.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:22):**  And it sounds to me like that is inextricably linked with the resilience of those systems.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:28):**  Like you may be able to have a higher carrying capacity for humans by wiping out some of  
**[0:48:33-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:33):**  the diversity, cultivating things as monocrops and increasing the calories available to one  
**[0:48:38-0:48:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:38):**  species.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:39):**  But in turn, you completely deplete the resiliency of that system.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:44):**  You create it to be dependent on outside inputs.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:48):**  And as soon as those dry up, it can't sustain itself.  
**[0:48:51-0:48:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:51):**  And the carrying capacity then dips majorly.  
**[0:48:54-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:54):**  And so there's a certain amount of species diversity within a resilient system that is  
**[0:49:00-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:00):**  absolutely necessary for the carrying capacity for humans.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:05):**  Because most people kind of think of it in the longterm, how many people can be sustained  
**[0:49:09-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:09):**  by that?  
**[0:49:11-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:11):**  It's not necessarily just how much resource we can create available for us, but how much  
**[0:49:16-0:49:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:16):**  those resources can regenerate themselves in a sustainable and a resilient way in the  
**[0:49:20-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:20):**  longterm.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:22):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:23):**  And being resilient means to be able to respond to disturbance.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:27):**  Of course.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:28):**  Changes.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:29):**  And like people who have cattle, they have cold season grasses, warm season grasses,  
**[0:49:34-0:49:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:34):**  wet season grasses, dry season grasses.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:37):**  They know the importance of a diverse grasses and forbs and things in the field for the  
**[0:49:42-0:49:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:42):**  cattle.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:43):**  The only way that it can support the cattle is they have to be ready for every kind of  
**[0:49:46-0:49:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:46):**  disturbance, every kind of extreme weather situation so that these cattle can actually  
**[0:49:51-0:49:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:51):**  graze and they can have a profit and they can put on weight.  
**[0:49:55-0:50:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:55):**  Well, we need to really look at that on our properties and we're doing the design too,  
**[0:50:00-0:50:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:00):**  because the diversity means that when it is hot or we have dry weather, we have plants  
**[0:50:05-0:50:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:05):**  that actually are fine with that.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:07):**  It's within their tolerance range, if not an expectation in order to do that.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:11):**  And then we need something in a wet cold season when other plants might have fungus or there  
**[0:50:15-0:50:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:15):**  might be disease or when the humidity is really high, other plants aren't affected by that.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:20):**  And that's where diversity comes in.  
**[0:50:22-0:50:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:22):**  I've been experimenting with this in an extreme sort of way with pistachios.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:27):**  I've never grown pistachios and I'm working with the graces of my clients on this, but  
**[0:50:32-0:50:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:32):**  pistachios need a very warm, dry, long dry season.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:37):**  Now the tree will survive and like a lot of plants that you can grow, like here we can  
**[0:50:41-0:50:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:41):**  have apricots or we can have different things, but we'll probably not get a harvest maybe  
**[0:50:45-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:45):**  once every five years when the weather is perfect and the frost was at a certain date  
**[0:50:50-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:50):**  and we had all these conditions were just right.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:52):**  But then when you do, you get this huge bumper crop.  
**[0:50:55-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:55):**  So the same thing in these areas where we know the pistachios will survive if they have  
**[0:51:00-0:51:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:00):**  a drought, if they have a log hot, dry summer, guess what tree is really going to rally in  
**[0:51:05-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:05):**  that situation?  
**[0:51:06-0:51:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:06):**  It's going to be the pistachios.  
**[0:51:08-0:51:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:08):**  Now this needs a lot of refinement and we're playing with this in Albuquerque, we're playing  
**[0:51:11-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:11):**  with this in Maryland of all places so that when everything is under stress, you also  
**[0:51:17-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:17):**  have plants that actually love that kind of weather and that's where diversity comes in.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:21):**  Fire is the same thing.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:23):**  We have these disturbances and we've had a lot of fire in the news on the West Coast,  
**[0:51:28-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:28):**  actually all around the world and understanding that we need a diverse kinds of trees, diverse  
**[0:51:33-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:33):**  kinds of plants that actually reduce or resist flames or reduce going on fire as opposed  
**[0:51:38-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:38):**  to say in Portugal where they had a monoculture eucalyptus, which my friends now in California  
**[0:51:45-0:51:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:45):**  are finding that they're just cutting them down because eucalyptus is a nasty fire tree.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:49):**  Oh yeah, I found that while I was there.  
**[0:51:51-0:51:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:51):**  It was so big a part of the narrative that they planned to them for specific reasons  
**[0:51:57-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:57):**  back then, but now that the fire season and the extent of the area that it affects is  
**[0:52:01-0:52:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:01):**  much larger, it's one of the most dangerous trees that you could have mature in those  
**[0:52:05-0:52:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:05):**  types of areas.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:06):**  The bark peels off it like newspaper on fire and flies through the air and so if you have  
**[0:52:11-0:52:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:11):**  any wind and it burns very, very hot and like the ones we saw in Portugal, the trees that  
**[0:52:16-0:52:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:16):**  burn fully, they actually burned into the ground and burned the roots.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:20):**  So there are all these holes in the ground.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:22):**  Of course, maybe a very hard way of making biochar, but all these roots actually burned  
**[0:52:27-0:52:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:27):**  into the ground.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:28):**  So you can imagine the ground being now sterilized around these roots because they're burning  
**[0:52:33-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:33):**  at super high temperatures with all the oil that's in these trees.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:37):**  So kind of back to your question, so diversity in all cases and always possible because it's  
**[0:52:44-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:44):**  an ecological system that we're trying to make that fits our system and like I like  
**[0:52:48-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:48):**  to say in our design process and site assessment is that we will be imprinted by the land.  
**[0:52:54-0:52:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:54):**  We're not imprinting on the land.  
**[0:52:56-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:56):**  We need to change our tastes.  
**[0:52:58-0:53:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:58):**  We need to change our expectation of the food and adapt our lifestyle to where we live like  
**[0:53:03-0:53:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:03):**  everybody else does in the rest of the world over thousands and tens of thousands of years.  
**[0:53:08-0:53:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:08):**  They've adapted and created their culture and their lifestyle.  
**[0:53:12-0:53:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:12):**  Everybody from the Inuit, right, to the people in Senegal, to the people in Haiti, the indigenous  
**[0:53:17-0:53:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:17):**  people have built cultures by adapting their life to the situation that they're in and  
**[0:53:23-0:53:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:23):**  they've rallied for that.  
**[0:53:24-0:53:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:24):**  There is no reason to disparage people who are living subsistence lifestyles because  
**[0:53:29-0:53:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:29):**  they've learned to adapt and they are actually doing so much less damage to the land than  
**[0:53:34-0:53:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:34):**  people who have learned to extract it and take more from it by imprinting what they  
**[0:53:39-0:53:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:39):**  think is necessary for a lifestyle.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:42):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:53:43-0:53:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:43):**  Now here, let's take a little change in direction for a second and focus a little bit on the  
**[0:53:47-0:53:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:47):**  business side of running a design firm.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:51):**  Let's talk about, first of all, some of the challenges on the business side, especially  
**[0:53:56-0:53:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:56):**  when it comes to finding clients.  
**[0:53:58-0:53:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:58):**  Right.  
**[0:53:59-0:54:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:59):**  So in my case, I was pretty lucky because I was a freelance photographer designer for  
**[0:54:05-0:54:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:05):**  25 years.  
**[0:54:06-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:06):**  Independent, you might say a lone wolf much of the time doing that.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:11):**  So learning about relationships and promoting my work, what I want to show people in order  
**[0:54:16-0:54:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:16):**  to get the projects, that was great in a commercial setting.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:19):**  In the ecological setting and especially in permaculture and ecological design, it's a  
**[0:54:24-0:54:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:24):**  little bit harder.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:25):**  It's not a local field.  
**[0:54:27-0:54:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:27):**  You really have to spread out and be willing to travel and be willing to take some risks  
**[0:54:32-0:54:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:32):**  in doing work and elsewhere by understanding the actual principles.  
**[0:54:35-0:54:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:35):**  Like I was talking about having a process.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:37):**  It doesn't matter where I go because I have this process like a lot of us do, site assessment.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:42):**  I just need to be humble and find out the information.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:45):**  So you kind of have to spread out where you can work.  
**[0:54:48-0:54:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:48):**  Otherwise, if you're just working locally, you're kind of limiting yourself on the availability  
**[0:54:52-0:54:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:52):**  of type of work that you can do and you're going to just generally do what everybody  
**[0:54:56-0:54:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:56):**  else does.  
**[0:54:57-0:55:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:57):**  Now, of course, I don't want to put down general landscaping.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:00):**  I have a lot of friends in permaculture.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:02):**  That's what they do and they influence everybody in suburbia and urban areas bringing in permaculture  
**[0:55:08-0:55:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:08):**  and ecological design into the ornamental design to the aesthetic designs that they're  
**[0:55:12-0:55:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:12):**  doing on land.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:14):**  It's funny to hear about the surprising plants.  
**[0:55:16-0:55:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:16):**  They'll just put them in the landscape and they look beautiful and then they'll get a  
**[0:55:19-0:55:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:19):**  call from the owner going, hey, there's these great berries on these plants.  
**[0:55:22-0:55:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:22):**  What are those for?  
**[0:55:23-0:55:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:23):**  And you say, oh, you eat those.  
**[0:55:24-0:55:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:24):**  Oh, and by the way, you can eat all these other ones too for this part of the design.  
**[0:55:28-0:55:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:28):**  Nice.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:29):**  Kind of subversive ecological landscaping.  
**[0:55:32-0:55:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:32):**  A little bit of gentle gorilla landscaping.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:36):**  So in a business sense, you really have to decide what you want to do and then figure  
**[0:55:42-0:55:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:42):**  out where that market is.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:43):**  And that's with any kind of art.  
**[0:55:44-0:55:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:44):**  It's really any kind of business.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:46):**  What are you happy with?  
**[0:55:48-0:55:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:48):**  And then try to make that work and get that out there.  
**[0:55:52-0:55:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:52):**  I would, in a sense, try to be, especially when we have more and more people coming into  
**[0:55:56-0:55:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:56):**  the field, is find a specialty.  
**[0:55:59-0:56:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:59):**  Find something that you can be extreme about and that you can be known for.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:04):**  That's a way to get hired and to be seen.  
**[0:56:07-0:56:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:07):**  Now in my case, unashamedly, I have about five Facebook pages.  
**[0:56:11-0:56:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:11):**  I've got three websites.  
**[0:56:13-0:56:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:13):**  I'm involved with a number of organizations because I want to get my material out there  
**[0:56:19-0:56:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:19):**  as much as possible.  
**[0:56:21-0:56:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:21):**  Every time I do a design, every time I'm doing something interesting or find something new,  
**[0:56:25-0:56:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:25):**  let everybody know because it's an opportunity to see the graphics that I really like doing  
**[0:56:30-0:56:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:30):**  and the style that I like to show people in order to move that kind of standard that I'm  
**[0:56:35-0:56:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:35):**  looking for to move that forward.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:37):**  So promoting yourself with what you do, a website, of course, is needed.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:43):**  A very good website that's well done.  
**[0:56:46-0:56:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:46):**  I just redid southwoodscenter.com, Warushka Kierkegaard, who is one of our United Designers  
**[0:56:51-0:56:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:51):**  in the Netherlands.  
**[0:56:52-0:56:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:52):**  She was an interior designer.  
**[0:56:54-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:54):**  She's a permaculture and ecological designer now.  
**[0:56:57-0:57:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:57):**  Interesting change, right?  
**[0:57:00-0:57:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:00):**  And of course, she was just saying, Dan, you got to fix this website.  
**[0:57:03-0:57:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:03):**  My website was like, it's old school, I have to admit.  
**[0:57:06-0:57:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:06):**  And she just took it apart and put it back together and I really love it.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:09):**  That's southwoodscenter.com.  
**[0:57:11-0:57:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:11):**  It's just design work, focusing on what I do as opposed to a lot of other things.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:15):**  And I think that really was the key is focus on your best type of work, what you can be  
**[0:57:20-0:57:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:20):**  an expert at, put all your time into that, whether it's mushrooms or water systems or  
**[0:57:26-0:57:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:26):**  like Brad Lancaster, right?  
**[0:57:28-0:57:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:28):**  It takes time, but be known for what is successful.  
**[0:57:32-0:57:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:32):**  It might be mushrooms.  
**[0:57:34-0:57:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:34):**  It might be cheeses or it might be ecological, anything, anything you can find out that you  
**[0:57:38-0:57:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:38):**  might want to do as a product or as a system.  
**[0:57:41-0:57:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:41):**  Be very good at that.  
**[0:57:42-0:57:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:42):**  Think of your marketing, think of your reputation and then your brand.  
**[0:57:46-0:57:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:46):**  And that's very important.  
**[0:57:47-0:57:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:47):**  Have a name.  
**[0:57:48-0:57:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:48):**  Now, Southwoods here was the name of our property.  
**[0:57:51-0:57:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:51):**  It actually came from a previous business, but I kind of liked it, so I kept it.  
**[0:57:55-0:57:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:55):**  Now that I have it, I can't really change it.  
**[0:57:57-0:58:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:57):**  So it's very important to know what the name of your company is going to be so that you  
**[0:58:01-0:58:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:01):**  can be seen.  
**[0:58:02-0:58:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:02):**  I'm also a graphic designer, so logos are very important to me in the presence of my  
**[0:58:06-0:58:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:06):**  being able to see my work, especially at conferences and things like that.  
**[0:58:09-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:09):**  They can recognize my style.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:11):**  Now, marketing yourself of course is very important.  
**[0:58:15-0:58:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:15):**  It's like any business and once you're doing any kind of business, it doesn't matter if  
**[0:58:19-0:58:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:19):**  you're in permaculture or it doesn't matter what you're doing.  
**[0:58:23-0:58:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:23):**  Business practices are universal.  
**[0:58:25-0:58:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:25):**  Good business practices cannot change whether using QuickBooks, whatever kind of accounting  
**[0:58:29-0:58:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:29):**  system, getting yourself a tax ID, getting licensed, getting all these things taken care  
**[0:58:34-0:58:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:34):**  of.  
**[0:58:35-0:58:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:35):**  It's like the infrastructure of your farm.  
**[0:58:37-0:58:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:37):**  We can do all these fancy things in the landscape, but if your electrical system is bad and your  
**[0:58:42-0:58:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:42):**  well isn't good and your driveway is full of potholes, that doesn't really help getting  
**[0:58:47-0:58:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:47):**  everything else work.  
**[0:58:49-0:58:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:49):**  So getting a business consultant, maybe some classes about how to run a business is very  
**[0:58:54-0:58:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:54):**  good.  
**[0:58:55-0:58:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:55):**  Plus you have all these people online now, they're trying to help you do that.  
**[0:58:58-0:59:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:58):**  Some very good online courses now with business structure and with the work that I'm going  
**[0:59:02-0:59:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:02):**  to do in my courses coming up, we do talk about business, but we're mostly focusing  
**[0:59:06-0:59:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:06):**  on ecological design using Illustrator or advanced technical drawing skills.  
**[0:59:12-0:59:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:12):**  I really like what you mentioned there and it's definitely been my experience that would  
**[0:59:15-0:59:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:15):**  echo that.  
**[0:59:18-0:59:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:18):**  I was not educated in business.  
**[0:59:21-0:59:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:21):**  I didn't even go through the normal university path of formal education.  
**[0:59:26-0:59:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:26):**  As I was starting to put together my services and offer them to clients, as soon as I started  
**[0:59:31-0:59:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:31):**  to get fancy or start to get a little bit too niche, I found that the problems that  
**[0:59:39-0:59:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:39):**  were holding me back were always rooted in the fundamentals, the things that are structural  
**[0:59:45-0:59:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:45):**  that were either broken or not fully well thought out.  
**[0:59:49-0:59:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:49):**  Even to this day, as I start to move into different offerings and different types of  
**[0:59:53-0:59:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:53):**  content and services that I've offered through my own company, whenever I hit a snag, I always  
**[0:59:58-1:00:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:58):**  find that the root problem of that is just the basics.  
**[1:00:02-1:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:02):**  I didn't bother to put in systems for the accounting.  
**[1:00:07-1:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:07):**  I overlooked something that was very, very basic.  
**[1:00:10-1:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:10):**  I think that's fantastic advice for anybody getting into any type of business is really  
**[1:00:14-1:00:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:14):**  put your efforts into establishing a base, a really solid foundation that you can then  
**[1:00:19-1:00:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:19):**  expand onto other offerings and products or services.  
**[1:00:24-1:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:24):**  Now in your own experience with so many different types of businesses and collaborations that  
**[1:00:33-1:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:33):**  you've done, what have been some of the challenges and the rewards of collaboration and not just  
**[1:00:39-1:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:39):**  going it on your own, even though you started as a freelancer, you've started to work a  
**[1:00:43-1:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:43):**  lot with other organizations and people.  
**[1:00:46-1:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:46):**  Yeah.  
**[1:00:48-1:00:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:48):**  Yeah.  
**[1:00:49-1:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:49):**  So the joy of doing design is like anything else, going to see a movie, camping, whatever  
**[1:00:54-1:00:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:54):**  it is, is to work with other people and share it with other people.  
**[1:00:58-1:01:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:58):**  So a shared experience is twice as fun, right?  
**[1:01:02-1:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:02):**  You also are sharing the responsibility and the anxiety and the stress of that work.  
**[1:01:10-1:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:10):**  And one of the things that I have to get better at, and I'm pretty good at it generally speaking,  
**[1:01:14-1:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:14):**  but more and more you need to jump on it faster, is delegating and bringing in partners in  
**[1:01:18-1:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:18):**  design to help share the experience.  
**[1:01:21-1:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:21):**  Now there are many cases where that's obvious.  
**[1:01:23-1:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:23):**  When I'm working in another country, say the project that we have in Poland that I'm working  
**[1:01:28-1:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:28):**  on, immediately I'm trying to find somebody close by that understands, if not speaks the  
**[1:01:33-1:01:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:33):**  language, that can help me work with that so they can fill in the blanks.  
**[1:01:37-1:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:37):**  I think it's important to know, and I think for myself especially, it's design and it's  
**[1:01:42-1:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:42):**  design process, but it needs to be informed by the correct content.  
**[1:01:48-1:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:48):**  So I could say design a magazine, have the fantastic design, but if the content is bad  
**[1:01:53-1:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:53):**  and the articles are bad, it's not written well, right?  
**[1:01:56-1:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:56):**  That's not going to work.  
**[1:01:57-1:01:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:57):**  It's not going to sell.  
**[1:01:58-1:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:58):**  So I need to be informed for the design by the quality information, and that means partnering  
**[1:02:04-1:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:04):**  with people that work.  
**[1:02:05-1:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:05):**  Now in the case in Poland, it was great because I'm working with Boruska, Kierkegaard in the  
**[1:02:10-1:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:10):**  Netherlands, and she's Danish.  
**[1:02:13-1:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:13):**  She grew up near the ocean.  
**[1:02:15-1:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:15):**  She understood estuaries and what's going on in Northern Europe with that, a lot of  
**[1:02:19-1:02:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:19):**  the plants and the symbols, and was greatly helping me information.  
**[1:02:23-1:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:23):**  Plus she speaks the languages in order to do the data mining to find out this information.  
**[1:02:28-1:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:28):**  So in an international sense, it's required that you find somebody local, and it's pretty  
**[1:02:31-1:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:31):**  easy to do in permaculture circles on many levels or through references.  
**[1:02:36-1:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:36):**  But just say, even in the biome that you might be, especially when I'm going to dry lands,  
**[1:02:41-1:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:41):**  and I'd mentioned Neil Bertrando before, as soon as I hit dry lands, if I'm in Senegal  
**[1:02:45-1:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:45):**  or if I went to Haiti or anywhere else, I have a dry land person and that's Neil.  
**[1:02:50-1:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:50):**  And Neil's got it down because he lives in Reno, which is not necessarily super dry,  
**[1:02:54-1:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:54):**  but it's dry, right?  
**[1:02:56-1:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:56):**  And he studied that.  
**[1:02:57-1:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:57):**  Like I said about being extreme and having a specialty.  
**[1:03:00-1:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:00):**  So the more I work with him in these different other dry areas, the better he gets, the more  
**[1:03:04-1:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:04):**  informed he gets, and we both win on that.  
**[1:03:07-1:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:07):**  And then we also have a nice little design to show other people and promote each other.  
**[1:03:12-1:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:12):**  So finding people right off the bat that are experts in the area that you're working or  
**[1:03:16-1:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:16):**  understand that the best, like the tropics, when I was doing some work in Costa Rica,  
**[1:03:20-1:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:20):**  Nick Tittle was in Thailand, emailed him and said, hey, I got this and this and this going  
**[1:03:25-1:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:25):**  on.  
**[1:03:26-1:03:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:26):**  Can you tell me the polycultures that would work and help us with that?  
**[1:03:29-1:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:29):**  And he sent me about 17 different tropical polycultures that we just had to massage a  
**[1:03:34-1:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:34):**  little bit for working in Costa Rica, and we still use those today in the tropics, right?  
**[1:03:39-1:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:39):**  Talk about saving me so much time and I learned and accelerated my learning process, but it  
**[1:03:44-1:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:44):**  is very important to get the right content because like I say, it's the word design.  
**[1:03:49-1:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:49):**  That's what I do, but my design needs to be informed by good information.  
**[1:03:54-1:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:54):**  Now the other part of doing that too is there are skills and say the data mining and building  
**[1:03:59-1:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:59):**  the base map that is good work and I actually enjoy that.  
**[1:04:03-1:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:03):**  But on these larger projects I need to start delegating and this is how we create better  
**[1:04:07-1:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:07):**  designers and bring up people in design.  
**[1:04:10-1:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:10):**  I need to start delegating those foundational tasks to other people.  
**[1:04:14-1:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:14):**  I love data mining, going on the internet, getting those endorphins flying, finding out  
**[1:04:18-1:04:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:18):**  all sorts of information, going off and living tangents all the time is a lot of fun, but  
**[1:04:23-1:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:23):**  I need other people to do that now so I can focus on the concepts and the bigger problems  
**[1:04:28-1:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:28):**  and trying to develop the different strategies that we're going to use and also get more  
**[1:04:32-1:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:32):**  work.  
**[1:04:33-1:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:33):**  The more people I have and the more working and the faster we get this done, now our bigger  
**[1:04:38-1:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:38):**  or broader scope of information that we can get faster.  
**[1:04:41-1:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:41):**  We also have a deeper understanding and a lot more experience in these different areas,  
**[1:04:46-1:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:46):**  which even then it's just more work.  
**[1:04:48-1:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:48):**  So one of my goals and as you might know with United designers, it's to do a lot more team  
**[1:04:53-1:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:53):**  design, get three or four people on every project that we're doing and then bring in  
**[1:04:57-1:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:57):**  other people at the time and those that want to enter and start being designers also bring  
**[1:05:02-1:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:02):**  them in and say, okay, we start with data mining.  
**[1:05:05-1:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:05):**  Here's the table, go nuts.  
**[1:05:06-1:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:06):**  Do you have any questions?  
**[1:05:08-1:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:08):**  Let us know.  
**[1:05:09-1:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:09):**  But that information is very important to us.  
**[1:05:11-1:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:11):**  Then if somebody wants to work in Illustrator and start doing base maps, absolutely.  
**[1:05:16-1:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:16):**  Here's our data mining information.  
**[1:05:18-1:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:18):**  Here's our aerials.  
**[1:05:19-1:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:19):**  Maybe we went with the drone or had somebody do the drone maps for us.  
**[1:05:22-1:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:22):**  Maybe Ben Missimer in Mississippi, one of our partners took all the Dem information  
**[1:05:26-1:05:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:26):**  from the drones and made us these beautiful topographic maps and all sorts of other things.  
**[1:05:31-1:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:31):**  We bring that information and then we hand that off to the second person, say, great,  
**[1:05:34-1:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:34):**  get that base map done.  
**[1:05:36-1:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:36):**  We're using, getting their style.  
**[1:05:38-1:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:38):**  And then after that works and all these things start coming in and just like we're doing  
**[1:05:41-1:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:41):**  right now, we do zoom meetings.  
**[1:05:43-1:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:43):**  And so we're all talking, sharing screens.  
**[1:05:45-1:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:45):**  Here's what's going on.  
**[1:05:47-1:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:47):**  And let me tell you, having three or four brains on one project is exponentially better  
**[1:05:52-1:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:52):**  than just this one, right?  
**[1:05:54-1:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:54):**  It just the stress about it and having to understand all these things.  
**[1:05:56-1:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:56):**  We need all these people thinking in parallel about the same solution so we can come up  
**[1:06:01-1:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:01):**  with better strategies.  
**[1:06:02-1:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:02):**  Yeah.  
**[1:06:03-1:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:03):**  The amount of exchange of ideas and things that you would never have come to or imagined  
**[1:06:08-1:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:08):**  on your own, I've always found is so much larger and so much worth even some of the  
**[1:06:12-1:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:12):**  hassles in interpersonal differences and the struggles of collaboration.  
**[1:06:17-1:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:17):**  It's really worth it for that extra mind and expertise that gives perspective on the project  
**[1:06:25-1:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:25):**  at large, but also the interactions even with clients, aspects on ways to improve the service  
**[1:06:31-1:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:31):**  is offered and the business aspect.  
**[1:06:33-1:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:33):**  It's always worth it.  
**[1:06:36-1:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:36):**  How have you sort of put in systems to increase or ensure that communication is maintained,  
**[1:06:46-1:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:46):**  that open and honest communication is facilitated or promoted?  
**[1:06:52-1:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:52):**  Because I've always found in my case that that's where the breakdown can happen in these  
**[1:06:56-1:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:56):**  collaborations.  
**[1:06:57-1:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:57):**  Right.  
**[1:06:58-1:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:58):**  Yeah.  
**[1:06:59-1:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:59):**  We have to have a really good understanding with each other.  
**[1:07:01-1:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:01):**  We do have, we have memorandums of understanding.  
**[1:07:04-1:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:04):**  We have the contracts type of situation and our understanding is this is the contract.  
**[1:07:08-1:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:08):**  This is our understanding.  
**[1:07:09-1:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:09):**  If it isn't on here, it doesn't exist.  
**[1:07:11-1:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:11):**  So let's make sure we cover our bases on that.  
**[1:07:14-1:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:14):**  The other agreement we have too, which is kind of a handshake sort of thing is that  
**[1:07:17-1:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:17):**  the project is what needs to get done well.  
**[1:07:20-1:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:20):**  Let's focus on that.  
**[1:07:22-1:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:22):**  If we have problems and we're going to have misunderstandings, all of that, but we're  
**[1:07:25-1:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:25):**  focusing on doing the project well so we all have a really nice, you know, another feather  
**[1:07:31-1:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:31):**  in our hat.  
**[1:07:32-1:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:32):**  We have a better understanding and the client gets what they need.  
**[1:07:35-1:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:35):**  So any kind of misunderstandings, let's put those aside.  
**[1:07:38-1:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:38):**  Let's know that they're going to happen.  
**[1:07:39-1:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:39):**  They're going to happen and then let's do it better next time.  
**[1:07:42-1:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:42):**  So communication is really important.  
**[1:07:44-1:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:44):**  So we have, we have Google docs of course.  
**[1:07:47-1:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:47):**  So when we're doing our site assessment table, that's in Google word or Google doc, right?  
**[1:07:52-1:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:52):**  That's on there.  
**[1:07:53-1:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:53):**  So you can see what the information is as somebody else or we're all filling it in,  
**[1:07:55-1:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:55):**  which is what I love about that.  
**[1:07:57-1:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:57):**  Our plant lists are on the Google sheets.  
**[1:08:00-1:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:00):**  So as we're adding plants, everybody can see that too.  
**[1:08:03-1:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:03):**  Then we use Dropbox for all the design work and Dropbox unfortunately you can't work simultaneous  
**[1:08:08-1:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:08):**  on it yet, but all of the PDF information, all the contracts, all the process sheets,  
**[1:08:15-1:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:15):**  all those things are in folders and ready to go.  
**[1:08:18-1:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:18):**  So content wise, everybody has access to that in the design team.  
**[1:08:23-1:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:23):**  Then we're doing these zooms and just talking and discussing about a lot of things.  
**[1:08:28-1:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:28):**  And what really helps with that too is we all have stories that we all have experiences  
**[1:08:32-1:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:32):**  and that makes it fun, right?  
**[1:08:34-1:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:34):**  We have anecdotes about, well, I did this here and did this there.  
**[1:08:37-1:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:37):**  And the more work that we do, the more stories we can tell is the better.  
**[1:08:41-1:08:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:41):**  But it really is about a team attitude and the fact that we are fallible and we're going  
**[1:08:46-1:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:46):**  to make mistakes and as much as we're trying to keep ego out of this, somebody might feel  
**[1:08:50-1:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:50):**  bad or something didn't get so told well.  
**[1:08:54-1:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:54):**  And now when we're working in cross cultures, we have people in Spain or the Netherlands,  
**[1:08:58-1:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:58):**  right?  
**[1:08:59-1:09:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:59):**  Or people in South Africa, things get misunderstood and then we have to be very careful how we  
**[1:09:04-1:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:04):**  say things, right?  
**[1:09:06-1:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:06):**  We have to have the same understanding of what we're talking about.  
**[1:09:09-1:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:09):**  And we have some misunderstandings based on terminology or using colloquialisms that are,  
**[1:09:14-1:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:14):**  you know, phrases that are used in these countries that the other people aren't going to understand.  
**[1:09:18-1:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:18):**  So it really is about the client first and this has been just like it was in my other  
**[1:09:23-1:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:23):**  career.  
**[1:09:24-1:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:24):**  It was about the job.  
**[1:09:25-1:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:25):**  We'll argue about things after that's done, but let's just suck it up.  
**[1:09:29-1:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:29):**  We need to get this done.  
**[1:09:30-1:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:30):**  Sorry about that.  
**[1:09:31-1:09:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:31):**  You know, let's move forward and then we'll talk about that and make sure that this doesn't  
**[1:09:35-1:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:35):**  happen again because it's always a learning experience.  
**[1:09:38-1:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:38):**  One of the last things I'll say about that too is the phrase is everybody's got to eat.  
**[1:09:44-1:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:44):**  There are no free meal or free jobs.  
**[1:09:46-1:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:46):**  There's no free information.  
**[1:09:48-1:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:48):**  We have to be very upfront and that's worked out fairly well.  
**[1:09:51-1:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:51):**  I'll just say, here's the budget I have.  
**[1:09:54-1:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:54):**  Here's how much money I have for you.  
**[1:09:55-1:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:55):**  Can you do this?  
**[1:09:57-1:09:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:57):**  Right?  
**[1:09:58-1:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:58):**  And with Neil or with other people, with Sarah, Ben, Regina, who else is in there?  
**[1:10:06-1:10:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:06):**  Jessica Robertson in Canada, right?  
**[1:10:08-1:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:08):**  Or Ramees.  
**[1:10:09-1:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:09):**  We just say, here's the money I got for this part of the project.  
**[1:10:13-1:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:13):**  Are you cool with that?  
**[1:10:14-1:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:14):**  And if they say yes, boom, we're done.  
**[1:10:16-1:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:16):**  Whatever it takes them to get it done, that's their deal.  
**[1:10:19-1:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:19):**  That's not my deal.  
**[1:10:20-1:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:20):**  We have just set out what the deliverables are and what the expectation is and they just  
**[1:10:24-1:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:24):**  need to get that done.  
**[1:10:25-1:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:25):**  If it takes them eight hours to do it or 18 hours, that's up to them.  
**[1:10:30-1:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:30):**  And that's, I kind of like that flat fee.  
**[1:10:32-1:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:32):**  So the faster that you get at something, the more money you make.  
**[1:10:35-1:10:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:35):**  And that's kind of how it would work.  
**[1:10:37-1:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:37):**  People want to talk about like hourly wages and things like that.  
**[1:10:39-1:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:39):**  I have a real hard time with that.  
**[1:10:41-1:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:41):**  You know, Ben works really hard on doing the dem files and getting the topography done.  
**[1:10:46-1:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:46):**  He's working Illustrator great.  
**[1:10:47-1:10:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:47):**  He does plant symbols for me and all that kind of stuff.  
**[1:10:50-1:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:50):**  And I basically have to say a budget for that.  
**[1:10:53-1:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:53):**  And if he cranks those out in three or four hours or in an evening, fantastic, right?  
**[1:10:57-1:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:57):**  I still got what I wanted and we negotiated well and understand that.  
**[1:11:01-1:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:01):**  So it's the money part is really the hardest part.  
**[1:11:04-1:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:04):**  It's like, it's always the hardest part.  
**[1:11:07-1:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:07):**  Even what we're charging people is hard, right?  
**[1:11:09-1:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:09):**  And how to make sense of that.  
**[1:11:10-1:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:10):**  There's no calculation for it.  
**[1:11:13-1:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:13):**  One hundred and sixty eight or sixty acre project, you know, it might be 15 grand.  
**[1:11:17-1:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:17):**  You know, another one might be five.  
**[1:11:19-1:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:19):**  Why?  
**[1:11:20-1:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:20):**  A lot of reasons why there's this huge disparity in size.  
**[1:11:23-1:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:23):**  Right.  
**[1:11:24-1:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:24):**  But how do you decide what that is?  
**[1:11:26-1:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:26):**  That's different.  
**[1:11:27-1:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:27):**  But also I have to say that's why you bring in other people, even when you're doing that,  
**[1:11:31-1:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:31):**  start your group early and then use that as a discussion point.  
**[1:11:35-1:11:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:35):**  What should we charge?  
**[1:11:36-1:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:36):**  What do you think we should do?  
**[1:11:37-1:11:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:37):**  And now everybody's on right from the get go.  
**[1:11:41-1:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:41):**  I love these observations and I'm learning so much in this process.  
**[1:11:44-1:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:44):**  And I'm wondering now if you could give me some direct examples of how these things have  
**[1:11:49-1:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:49):**  sort of played out and some of the overall visions of three of the main organizations  
**[1:11:54-1:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:54):**  that you work with.  
**[1:11:55-1:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:55):**  And I'm referring to the PRI Cold Climate Institute, the United Designers and Natural  
**[1:12:01-1:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:01):**  Capital Plant Database.  
**[1:12:03-1:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:03):**  Let's work through those one by one if you're open to it.  
**[1:12:06-1:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:06):**  Just starting with the Permaculture Research Institute for Cold Climate.  
**[1:12:11-1:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:11):**  How did you get started with that?  
**[1:12:13-1:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:13):**  Where is it going?  
**[1:12:14-1:12:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:14):**  And sort of what is that overall vision?  
**[1:12:16-1:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:16):**  What are you trying to accomplish with it?  
**[1:12:18-1:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:18):**  Right.  
**[1:12:19-1:12:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:19):**  So there's kind of been some transition.  
**[1:12:22-1:12:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:22):**  And as things change, I have found the eco talk about succession.  
**[1:12:27-1:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:27):**  I found that in nonprofit organizations, especially in urban settings where people are involved  
**[1:12:32-1:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:32):**  with ecological systems, say the garden communities, things like that.  
**[1:12:36-1:12:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:36):**  So if you can remember, and some people might, what life was like in 2000, almost 20 years  
**[1:12:42-1:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:42):**  ago, right?  
**[1:12:43-1:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:43):**  In 2003.  
**[1:12:44-1:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:44):**  What was going on then?  
**[1:12:46-1:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:46):**  What was happening?  
**[1:12:48-1:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:48):**  Permaculture was barely known, especially in the Twin Cities, like I said.  
**[1:12:51-1:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:51):**  But when I was just reading about it and it wasn't until 2003 that I actually met somebody  
**[1:12:56-1:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:56):**  that was thinking the same way.  
**[1:12:58-1:13:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:58):**  So PRI, Cold Climate, came out of this, basically this critical mass of people that were bumping  
**[1:13:03-1:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:03):**  into each other.  
**[1:13:05-1:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:05):**  And then all of a sudden said, let's get organized.  
**[1:13:07-1:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:07):**  Let's start doing this.  
**[1:13:08-1:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:08):**  And it went from five to six to 12 to 24 to then 80 people over the years.  
**[1:13:13-1:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:13):**  So that was the inception of permaculture in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the Twin  
**[1:13:19-1:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:19):**  Cities area.  
**[1:13:20-1:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:20):**  And it grew and it grew and it grew.  
**[1:13:22-1:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:22):**  And it did a lot of training.  
**[1:13:23-1:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:23):**  It did a lot of classes.  
**[1:13:24-1:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:24):**  It was about the only organization doing that.  
**[1:13:26-1:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:26):**  Well, just imagine after 10 years of training all these people and doing all these classes,  
**[1:13:32-1:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:32):**  all these offshoots and other organizations that would start up, right?  
**[1:13:36-1:13:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:36):**  People would leave.  
**[1:13:37-1:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:37):**  They're working for schools.  
**[1:13:38-1:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:38):**  They're working for other nonprofit, things like that.  
**[1:13:41-1:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:41):**  There was another organization called Gardening Matters.  
**[1:13:44-1:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:44):**  Started way, way back when there wasn't a lot of community gardening.  
**[1:13:48-1:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:48):**  It wasn't organized.  
**[1:13:49-1:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:49):**  And they were like the big dog.  
**[1:13:51-1:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:51):**  They were getting everybody organized.  
**[1:13:53-1:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:53):**  They had the funding coming in.  
**[1:13:54-1:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:54):**  And they got a huge number of community gardens started.  
**[1:13:58-1:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:58):**  At the same time, schools and community gardens started also teaching this at the same time,  
**[1:14:03-1:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:03):**  right?  
**[1:14:04-1:14:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:04):**  So the problem kind of comes in then is after a while, pure cold climate has now created  
**[1:14:10-1:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:10):**  its own competition, right?  
**[1:14:12-1:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:12):**  It's actually fulfilled its destiny of what it was trying to do.  
**[1:14:17-1:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:17):**  And in some way, every nonprofit's goal should be to become obsolete, right?  
**[1:14:24-1:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:24):**  If you have an action that you're trying to take and you're trying to fix the world or  
**[1:14:28-1:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:28):**  you're trying to do something and make it happen, well, sooner or later, I would think  
**[1:14:31-1:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:31):**  it does happen and you're not needed anymore.  
**[1:14:33-1:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:33):**  You've been successful.  
**[1:14:34-1:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:34):**  Ideally, yeah.  
**[1:14:35-1:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:35):**  Ideally, right.  
**[1:14:36-1:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:36):**  Otherwise, you're not being very effective.  
**[1:14:38-1:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:38):**  Right.  
**[1:14:39-1:14:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:39):**  So all these people, we had 80 members.  
**[1:14:41-1:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:41):**  We did 24 people in the PDC, all these people going out and everybody, what's amazing with  
**[1:14:46-1:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:46):**  PRI cold climate that people started getting busy and doing their work and basically spread  
**[1:14:51-1:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:51):**  out.  
**[1:14:52-1:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:52):**  So PRI cold climate now has kind of taken a hiatus and people are off doing the work.  
**[1:14:57-1:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:57):**  They're doing a lot less education, a lot less programs because all these people are  
**[1:15:01-1:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:01):**  best like myself.  
**[1:15:02-1:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:02):**  I'm just off doing other things.  
**[1:15:04-1:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:04):**  Now, what that did move into, I have personally transitioned to was PRI USA.  
**[1:15:09-1:15:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:09):**  So PRI USA is the national organization, Permaculture Research Institute here and Neil's in that,  
**[1:15:16-1:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:16):**  Ramez, Owen HaBudzil.  
**[1:15:18-1:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:18):**  And so we're the directors of that.  
**[1:15:20-1:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:20):**  So that's more of a national nonprofit organization that I'm helping run to and kind of PRI cold  
**[1:15:25-1:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:25):**  climate, it's kind of left that and basically it's just sitting there waiting for who knows  
**[1:15:29-1:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:29):**  something to happen.  
**[1:15:30-1:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:30):**  It actually is fine.  
**[1:15:31-1:15:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:31):**  There's a lot, there's like three or four other organizations now doing PDCs that kind  
**[1:15:35-1:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:35):**  of came from that organization and that's kind of the natural progression with that.  
**[1:15:39-1:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:39):**  So PRI USA, we are a nonprofit organization and we're asking a fiscal agent.  
**[1:15:45-1:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:45):**  So if people want to start projects, start Permaculture, Food Force, whatever it might  
**[1:15:49-1:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:49):**  be, we act as a fiscal agent so that their donors could donate the money to us as a nonprofit  
**[1:15:55-1:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:55):**  and then we fund the profit so that their donors get the tax write off.  
**[1:15:59-1:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:59):**  That's what that's all about.  
**[1:16:00-1:16:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:00):**  And then the people put in the project, they never touch the money.  
**[1:16:03-1:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:03):**  They don't have to pay the taxes.  
**[1:16:04-1:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:04):**  We do all of that.  
**[1:16:06-1:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:06):**  We do all the accounting.  
**[1:16:07-1:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:07):**  So the project gets done, but the donors get a tax write off and the project people get  
**[1:16:11-1:16:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:11):**  the funds that they need in order to get that done.  
**[1:16:14-1:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:14):**  That is very important.  
**[1:16:15-1:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:15):**  Now, let's move to United Designers, which is a for profit enterprise and is a collection  
**[1:16:20-1:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:20):**  of designers located all over the world.  
**[1:16:22-1:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:22):**  You've talked a lot about some of the projects that you all have done together.  
**[1:16:26-1:16:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:26):**  Tell me how that vision came together and where you're at currently.  
**[1:16:29-1:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:29):**  Sure.  
**[1:16:30-1:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:30):**  So there was a conversation I was having with somebody, gee, it might have been four or  
**[1:16:35-1:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:35):**  five years ago about something that was missing in Permaculture and kind of an underlying  
**[1:16:40-1:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:40):**  tone.  
**[1:16:42-1:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:42):**  There are a lot of classes, courses, PDC, and the underlying tone of Permaculture a  
**[1:16:48-1:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:48):**  lot has been about the independent person, right?  
**[1:16:51-1:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:51):**  The homesteader, the person going out and being self sufficient and all of that.  
**[1:16:55-1:16:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:55):**  There wasn't a lot of teamwork, right?  
**[1:16:57-1:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:57):**  There's social permaculture and there's economics and things like that, but basically it wasn't  
**[1:17:02-1:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:02):**  a lot about working together as a team.  
**[1:17:05-1:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:05):**  And so after people were doing their PDCs and after people were getting out, it was  
**[1:17:09-1:17:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:09):**  like, how can we get people working together as teams?  
**[1:17:11-1:17:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:11):**  And then get their work done and learn from each other and come together and do better  
**[1:17:17-1:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:17):**  work.  
**[1:17:18-1:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:18):**  And so the idea with United designers right from the beginning was let's, every time there's  
**[1:17:22-1:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:22):**  a project, let's bring in at least one to two other people.  
**[1:17:26-1:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:26):**  And I've been trying to do that.  
**[1:17:27-1:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:27):**  Every time I get a job, I need to bring at least one to two other people to help me with  
**[1:17:31-1:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:31):**  it and then they will also, and we'll work with each other.  
**[1:17:35-1:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:35):**  So the way United designers started was I'm getting projects because it basically is my  
**[1:17:39-1:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:39):**  idea and I got to like model it of course, is getting the projects and then finding people  
**[1:17:44-1:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:44):**  that can work with me on that and then they will also hire me.  
**[1:17:48-1:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:48):**  So the only way to be part of United designers to actually have the job, but the jobs and  
**[1:17:53-1:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:53):**  the paying projects are what fund the education.  
**[1:17:56-1:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:56):**  And that's what I think is a new model.  
**[1:17:59-1:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:59):**  Learning permaculture, do the PDC, marketing it out there, getting a project, but then  
**[1:18:04-1:18:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:04):**  understanding that guess what?  
**[1:18:05-1:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:05):**  It's not all about you.  
**[1:18:06-1:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:06):**  You don't have to do this by yourself.  
**[1:18:09-1:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:09):**  The next level of your permaculture education, design education is going to be a real income  
**[1:18:14-1:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:14):**  generating opportunity that you can use to bring yourself to a higher level by working  
**[1:18:19-1:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:19):**  with all these other people that are already doing it.  
**[1:18:22-1:18:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:22):**  So that's how United designers work.  
**[1:18:24-1:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:24):**  Either we hire you because you have a specialty or you hire us because you're looking for  
**[1:18:28-1:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:28):**  help getting the work done.  
**[1:18:30-1:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:30):**  As soon as either one of those happen, you're in and you're basically staff.  
**[1:18:34-1:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:34):**  You're part of United designers.  
**[1:18:36-1:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:36):**  It's not a club.  
**[1:18:37-1:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:37):**  There's no member fit ship fees, any things like that.  
**[1:18:40-1:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:40):**  It's all based on actual work.  
**[1:18:42-1:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:42):**  And part of that is like a phrase I have.  
**[1:18:45-1:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:45):**  If you don't have any skin in the game, it's not going to work.  
**[1:18:48-1:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:48):**  Everybody has to have a risk involved.  
**[1:18:50-1:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:50):**  Everybody has to have the reputation on the line in order to make this work seriously  
**[1:18:54-1:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:54):**  and know that it needs to be done well.  
**[1:18:56-1:18:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:56):**  Then all of our best work comes from that.  
**[1:18:58-1:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:58):**  So it's about working as a team and then having our education funded by actual real projects.  
**[1:19:05-1:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:05):**  I really like the motivation for that and how you've structured it.  
**[1:19:09-1:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:09):**  I find really inspiring.  
**[1:19:10-1:19:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:10):**  Now before we go too long on that one, can you talk about the natural capital plant database,  
**[1:19:15-1:19:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:15):**  how that came about and what you aim to achieve with that organization?  
**[1:19:19-1:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:19):**  Sure.  
**[1:19:20-1:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:20):**  So I talked about Paula Westmoreland, who was my mentor, first person I met in permaculture.  
**[1:19:27-1:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:27):**  So about that same time, she was a programmer, a computer programmer, I think, a designer  
**[1:19:32-1:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:32):**  at that time.  
**[1:19:33-1:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:33):**  She was in permaculture in 1999, was working on doing her own landscape company.  
**[1:19:37-1:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:37):**  And she found that these plant databases that were out there for landscape did not have  
**[1:19:42-1:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:42):**  enough information for the ecological type of design work we wanted to do.  
**[1:19:45-1:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:45):**  It was all about aesthetics, color, height, texture, those kinds of things.  
**[1:19:50-1:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:50):**  Where they would grow, all was great, but there was nothing in there for ecological  
**[1:19:54-1:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:54):**  function because permaculture is about guilds.  
**[1:19:57-1:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:57):**  It's about things working together, polycultures.  
**[1:20:00-1:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:00):**  None of that existed in these databases.  
**[1:20:02-1:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:02):**  So she got a grant and she got a bunch of people together and decided we need to take  
**[1:20:07-1:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:07):**  all this information and rebuild it as a plant database.  
**[1:20:11-1:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:11):**  And so, she did actually, and then people from the PRI Co-Climate got together.  
**[1:20:15-1:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:15):**  It's about 12 people doing information data collection, putting this together.  
**[1:20:21-1:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:21):**  Basically I think it was in Excel and then it went into Access and then it went into  
**[1:20:26-1:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:26):**  some relational database software online in order to make it work.  
**[1:20:30-1:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:30):**  It was in Wiki, I think, the first iteration of that.  
**[1:20:34-1:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:34):**  And so we had a web developer that put this together and all this information and they  
**[1:20:38-1:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:38):**  got in the first set of plants was 1300 plants.  
**[1:20:41-1:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:41):**  Mostly with the upper Midwest, mostly from local.  
**[1:20:45-1:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:45):**  But you could put in your information and if I could share a screen with you, would  
**[1:20:49-1:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:49):**  that be okay?  
**[1:20:50-1:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:50):**  Yeah, go ahead.  
**[1:20:51-1:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:51):**  Let's see if that works.  
**[1:20:52-1:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:52):**  Okay.  
**[1:20:53-1:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:53):**  Yeah, that's a good way of putting it.  
**[1:20:55-1:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:55):**  Let's see if that works.  
**[1:20:57-1:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:57):**  I'm going to open this and come to here.  
**[1:21:01-1:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:01):**  Here we are.  
**[1:21:02-1:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:02):**  Okay.  
**[1:21:03-1:21:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:03):**  You see that okay?  
**[1:21:04-1:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:04):**  Yep, I can see it.  
**[1:21:05-1:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:05):**  Now, unfortunately, because this is over the audio, I'm not going to be able to share this  
**[1:21:08-1:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:08):**  during the podcast, but I will clip this video and include it in the show notes on the website  
**[1:21:14-1:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:14):**  below this.  
**[1:21:15-1:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:15):**  So anybody who's listening right now, you can log into abundantedge.com, find the episode  
**[1:21:19-1:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:19):**  and find this at the bottom of that page for those of you who want to see what Dan was  
**[1:21:23-1:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:23):**  just explaining.  
**[1:21:24-1:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:24):**  Okay.  
**[1:21:25-1:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:25):**  So this is the Natural Capital Plant Database.  
**[1:21:27-1:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:27):**  I've already signed in and there's information about permaculture, polyculture designs, about  
**[1:21:33-1:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:33):**  pollen myself and how it started, membership levels that we have.  
**[1:21:39-1:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:39):**  But the great information is the database.  
**[1:21:42-1:21:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:42):**  We have almost 2,400 plants now, so almost a thousand more than we had some years ago.  
**[1:21:48-1:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:48):**  And everything in here is ordered by a common name for us, but the scientific name is what  
**[1:21:55-1:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:55):**  pretty much everybody goes by.  
**[1:21:57-1:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:57):**  So each plant has a data table.  
**[1:22:01-1:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:01):**  So in this case, you see the list, there's natural plants associates, so those are plants  
**[1:22:04-1:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:04):**  that grow together.  
**[1:22:05-1:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:05):**  And if they go down there to alder, there are 19 different polycultures that green alder  
**[1:22:10-1:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:10):**  is part of.  
**[1:22:11-1:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:11):**  And I believe that's a nitrogen fixer.  
**[1:22:14-1:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:14):**  So if I click on one of these, like cat claw acacia, this is the information that Paula  
**[1:22:18-1:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:18):**  was going for and then we've expanded on over the years to give people what they need to  
**[1:22:23-1:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:23):**  know.  
**[1:22:24-1:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:24):**  So at the top of this page, you'll see all the plant detail.  
**[1:22:28-1:22:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:28):**  The name, scientific name, all that kind of information, characteristics, the size, the  
**[1:22:33-1:22:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:33):**  soil type that it needs, moisture, root type, depth, all those kind, every kind of information  
**[1:22:38-1:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:38):**  we can find about the plant's characteristics, we put it there.  
**[1:22:41-1:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:41):**  Then we have the tolerances, what kind of zones, soil pH it needs, drought, flood, salt,  
**[1:22:48-1:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:48):**  soil compaction, all those things.  
**[1:22:50-1:22:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:50):**  And then the behaviors, growing seasons, right?  
**[1:22:52-1:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:52):**  All the information that we want to know about a plant.  
**[1:22:56-1:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:56):**  But even more than that, what are all the human uses?  
**[1:22:59-1:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:59):**  So cat claw acacia is pretty great.  
**[1:23:01-1:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:01):**  It's a dry land plant.  
**[1:23:02-1:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:02):**  It's kind of a desert plant.  
**[1:23:05-1:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:05):**  But all the human uses, but then the ecological functions.  
**[1:23:08-1:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:08):**  And that's the thing that we are going for on the plant database is so you can search  
**[1:23:13-1:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:13):**  the database for all the nitrogen fixers as this is one.  
**[1:23:16-1:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:16):**  Maybe you need domestic animal forage, or maybe you need wildlife habitat.  
**[1:23:20-1:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:20):**  You can go to the search page, put in your growing zone, your soil type, any kind of  
**[1:23:26-1:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:26):**  sunlight restrictions there might be on there, if it floods once in a while, whatever that  
**[1:23:30-1:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:30):**  is, and then click on you want all the wildlife habitat plants, and it will give you a list  
**[1:23:35-1:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:35):**  that has that.  
**[1:23:36-1:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:36):**  And so this is what the plant database does.  
**[1:23:39-1:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:39):**  This is what I work with.  
**[1:23:40-1:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:40):**  This is what all our subscribers work with.  
**[1:23:43-1:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:43):**  We have 5,000 users in 70 countries, actually over 5,000.  
**[1:23:47-1:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:47):**  We have about 600 paid users.  
**[1:23:50-1:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:50):**  All this information is free unless you want to do basically a search for plants.  
**[1:23:56-1:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:56):**  And that's $30 a year right now.  
**[1:24:00-1:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:00):**  And this is the page for doing that.  
**[1:24:01-1:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:01):**  It's very simple.  
**[1:24:03-1:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:03):**  If you want to just go by plant type, you can do that.  
**[1:24:06-1:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:06):**  Otherwise put in your growing zone, the pH, and then your soil types, and any other information  
**[1:24:12-1:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:12):**  if it's a droughty area, if it's animal resistance you're looking for.  
**[1:24:17-1:24:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:17):**  And just like in permaculture, if we want to partition the soil, maybe I'm just looking  
**[1:24:20-1:24:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:20):**  for taproot plants, right?  
**[1:24:22-1:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:22):**  Maybe I'm looking for tubers or fibrous deep-rooted plants or fibrous shallow plants.  
**[1:24:27-1:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:27):**  You can also do that.  
**[1:24:29-1:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:29):**  Sometimes when we're working with windbreak, we need fast-growing trees, so I will use  
**[1:24:32-1:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:32):**  that sort of growth rate.  
**[1:24:35-1:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:35):**  But you can put that information in the top, then come to the bottom and say, I just want  
**[1:24:38-1:24:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:38):**  all the food plants that have my growing zone and my ecological conditions, and you'll get  
**[1:24:44-1:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:44):**  all the plants that you can eat that will come with that.  
**[1:24:48-1:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:48):**  Or I'll turn that off and I'll go over here and click on nitrogen fixers.  
**[1:24:51-1:24:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:51):**  I want all the nitrogen fixers, and then I'll get that list.  
**[1:24:55-1:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:55):**  And then once you get the list, maybe I'll try to do one here real quick.  
**[1:25:01-1:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:01):**  So make it a little more difficult.  
**[1:25:03-1:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:03):**  I have sandy, loamy soil, full sun, and I just want all the nitrogen fixers for that.  
**[1:25:12-1:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:12):**  I'm not going to pick, you can also go by family if you know what family you're looking  
**[1:25:15-1:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:15):**  for plants, or if you just want plant type.  
**[1:25:17-1:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:17):**  If the list is too long, you kind of have to do a limited a little more.  
**[1:25:22-1:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:22):**  Okay.  
**[1:25:23-1:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:23):**  I have 33 nitrogen fixing plants that I can use in this ecological state.  
**[1:25:29-1:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:29):**  Pretty good.  
**[1:25:31-1:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:31):**  Many of these might be native.  
**[1:25:33-1:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:33):**  Many of these might be something that's been naturalized, but there's a lot of ways to  
**[1:25:37-1:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:37):**  work with it.  
**[1:25:38-1:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:38):**  So fantastic.  
**[1:25:39-1:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:39):**  I really appreciate that explanation.  
**[1:25:40-1:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:40):**  It really kind of illuminated what you've been working on and how these different structures  
**[1:25:45-1:25:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:45):**  have been put together.  
**[1:25:48-1:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:48):**  Before I let you go, can you tell us a little bit about how our listeners can get in touch  
**[1:25:53-1:25:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:53):**  with you, the various organizations that you just mentioned and any courses or services  
**[1:25:59-1:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:59):**  that you'd like to educate them about?  
**[1:26:02-1:26:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:02):**  Sure.  
**[1:26:03-1:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:03):**  So my main website is southwoodscenter.com.  
**[1:26:07-1:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:07):**  That's where all my design work is.  
**[1:26:08-1:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:08):**  You can see a lot of the work that I've done in the past.  
**[1:26:12-1:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:12):**  Halsey1.com, H-A-L-S-E, the numeral one dot com, is our new education website.  
**[1:26:19-1:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:19):**  And that's where you can find information on advanced permaculture, where we have technical  
**[1:26:24-1:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:24):**  drawing.  
**[1:26:25-1:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:25):**  That's actually the drafting table type permaculture drawing advanced that I've done for about  
**[1:26:29-1:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:29):**  nine years teaching that.  
**[1:26:31-1:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:31):**  And then we also have a course coming up in July for Adobe Illustrator for ecological  
**[1:26:36-1:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:36):**  design.  
**[1:26:37-1:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:37):**  And that's also five days.  
**[1:26:38-1:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:38):**  I've taught that a number of times actually in the Netherlands and the US a number of  
**[1:26:42-1:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:42):**  times in different areas.  
**[1:26:45-1:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:45):**  And that's basically taking our advanced technical drawing and now converting all that process  
**[1:26:51-1:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:51):**  but understanding how to do it in Adobe Illustrator.  
**[1:26:55-1:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:55):**  And we have found that platform.  
**[1:26:56-1:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:56):**  Some people use SketchUp.  
**[1:26:57-1:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:57):**  There's a lot of different software programs.  
**[1:26:59-1:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:59):**  We have found, and I have to say everybody that's taken the class, and you might see  
**[1:27:04-1:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:04):**  a lot of people on Facebook too that have been using it, taught themselves or used my  
**[1:27:08-1:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:08):**  system to learn how to use it.  
**[1:27:10-1:27:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:10):**  They are all very happy with the quality of the work that you can do with that.  
**[1:27:14-1:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:14):**  Makes it so much easier.  
**[1:27:15-1:27:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:15):**  It's a very powerful program but it also makes it much easier to do the work.  
**[1:27:21-1:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:21):**  And also now we have libraries of information.  
**[1:27:24-1:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:24):**  So we're all using that same, talk about standardization.  
**[1:27:27-1:27:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:27):**  If we're all using Adobe Illustrator and saving all those symbols and plant symbols, right?  
**[1:27:31-1:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:31):**  Now that's where we're building a library.  
**[1:27:32-1:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:32):**  Ah, you get the groundswell.  
**[1:27:33-1:27:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:33):**  Yeah, everybody can tap into that database.  
**[1:27:35-1:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:35):**  That's very powerful.  
**[1:27:36-1:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:36):**  Yeah.  
**[1:27:37-1:27:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:37):**  So we have hundreds and hundreds of plants now.  
**[1:27:39-1:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:39):**  Plant symbols, even symbols for different cars and tractors, buildings, things like  
**[1:27:44-1:27:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:44):**  that.  
**[1:27:45-1:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:45):**  It makes it easier.  
**[1:27:46-1:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:46):**  So we have our standardized templates.  
**[1:27:48-1:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:48):**  So it's already done.  
**[1:27:50-1:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:50):**  Our sector maps, we have a number of those and different styles.  
**[1:27:53-1:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:53):**  But the templates and the symbols just make it easier to work and faster to work.  
**[1:27:58-1:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:58):**  And now we have this kind of a standardized brand, you might say, of how the information  
**[1:28:02-1:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:02):**  is displayed.  
**[1:28:03-1:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:03):**  And people really like it.  
**[1:28:04-1:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:04):**  It really improves the communication.  
**[1:28:07-1:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:07):**  I have no doubt.  
**[1:28:08-1:28:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:08):**  I think those things are extremely important to get out to more designers out there because  
**[1:28:12-1:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:12):**  these tools, like you said, are extremely powerful.  
**[1:28:14-1:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:14):**  And the potential for collaboration I see as one of the biggest advantages of all getting  
**[1:28:19-1:28:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:19):**  on these similar systems.  
**[1:28:21-1:28:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:21):**  Dan, it's been an absolute pleasure talking to you.  
**[1:28:24-1:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:24):**  More than anything, I'm really looking forward to connecting with you in a couple of weeks  
**[1:28:27-1:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:27):**  when I get back to Minnesota.  
**[1:28:30-1:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:30):**  The funny thing about this is I've been following your work for years and I've been living away  
**[1:28:33-1:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:33):**  from where I grew up for such a long time.  
**[1:28:36-1:28:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:36):**  It's going to be really fun to come full circle and actually visit some of the systems that  
**[1:28:40-1:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:40):**  you're working on there and be able to connect in person.  
**[1:28:42-1:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:42):**  Well, that'd be great, Oliver.  
**[1:28:44-1:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:44):**  I really hope to see you here on your trip.  
**[1:28:46-1:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:46):**  And we could do a little tour of the farm and look at other things that are going on.  
**[1:28:50-1:28:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:50):**  And I really appreciate this time and talking to you and having this conversation.  
**[1:28:54-1:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:54):**  Oh, the pleasure is all mine.  
**[1:28:55-1:28:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:55):**  And for those of you listening, definitely look out in the future for videos we might  
**[1:28:59-1:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:59):**  be able to make with each other when I go to visit Dan and his systems out in Minnesota  
**[1:29:03-1:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:29:03):**  soon too.  
**[1:29:04-1:29:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:29:04):**  So, yeah, again, thanks so much for taking the time.  
**[1:29:07-1:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:29:07):**  Let's stay in touch.  
**[1:29:08-1:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:29:08):**  And I really hope that perhaps we can even do a follow up interview in the future as  
**[1:29:12-1:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:29:12):**  more of these things continue to develop.  
**[1:29:14-1:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:29:14):**  I'm really watching these with a lot of hope and expectation.  
**[1:29:18-1:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:29:18):**  It's really inspiring.  
**[1:29:19-1:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:29:19):**  Thank you.  
**[1:29:20-1:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:29:20):**  I hope so.  
**[1:29:21-1:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:29:21):**  Thank you very again for bringing me in.

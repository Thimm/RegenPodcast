### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 27 Sep 2019 18:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:00:13):**  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:00:17):**  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:00:22):**  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:00:25):**  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this  
**[0:00:29-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:00:29):**  next episode, so let's jump right in.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:00:59):**  Alright, my guest today, Benitosteen, is one of the people that I've had most requested  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:01:21):**  from you listeners to do an interview with, in large part because of the success of his  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:01:25):**  YouTube channel called The Nito Project, where he works with his younger brother, Panther,  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:01:30):**  to make beautiful educational videos on natural building techniques, earthen plasters, and  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:01:35):**  even the Japanese method of making polished clay balls called Dorodango.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:01:40):**  Now Benito is the first of my guests who grow up in natural building since his childhood,  
**[0:01:44-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:01:44):**  rather than coming to the trades later in life.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:01:48):**  His parents, Bill and Athena Steen, being well-known natural building advocates and  
**[0:01:51-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:01:51):**  educators since the 80s, their family moved around the Southwest US and Mexico teaching  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:01:57):**  workshops and collaborating on projects that became the base for the skill set that he  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:02:02):**  now teaches and showcases in his videos.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:02:05):**  In this interview, Benito talks about his early experiences and interests in the building  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:02:10):**  trades and craftsmanship, not only with natural materials, but metalworking and blacksmithing  
**[0:02:15-0:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:02:15):**  too.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:02:16):**  We talk in detail about the high-end finish work that he's been learning and showcasing  
**[0:02:20-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:02:20):**  in his videos.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:02:21):**  We then explore the things that he and I have both learned from teaching natural building  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:02:25):**  in different parts of the world, not only the challenges of different materials and  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:02:29):**  access to tools, but also the different cultural and historical contexts that changed the way  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:02:34):**  people relate to buildings from the start.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:02:37):**  He and I also talk about some of the realities and challenges of building as a vocation,  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:02:42):**  and the process of working with clients and making a project come to fruition.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:02:46):**  So this ended up being less of a formal interview and more of a conversation, so don't worry  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:02:51):**  too much about getting concrete information and techniques out of this as much as a perspective  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:02:56):**  from two young builders who've traveled around a lot and love to experiment and play  
**[0:03:00-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:03:00):**  with different materials and techniques.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:03:02):**  So if you're looking for more actionable information on these topics, I highly recommend  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:03:06):**  the interview I did with Benito's dad Bill Steen in the previous season, and also the  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:03:10):**  interview with Kyle Holt-Tutor, both of which we reference in this chat and that I've  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:03:15):**  linked to in the show notes of this episode.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:03:17):**  You can also see the full library of podcasts on natural building that I've done just by  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:03:22):**  searching through the podcast tab in the navigation bar at abundantedge.com.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:03:27):**  So now I'll hand things over to Benito.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:03:30):**  Hey Benito, man, thank you so much for taking the time to be with me.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:03:35):**  I know we're across different continents navigating the time difference, but how are you doing?  
**[0:03:40-0:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:03:40):**  I'm doing great.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:03:42):**  It's great to be here.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:03:43):**  Thanks for having me.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:03:44):**  Hey, it's my pleasure.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:03:45):**  Now look, I've followed your work for a little while.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:03:47):**  I've seen some of the promos for your workshops in different places.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:03:51):**  In fact, some of the places that we've been have even overlapped quite a bit.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:03:54):**  So I think this is going to be a great conversation.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:03:57):**  What do you say you just start out by telling our listeners who are unfamiliar with you  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:04:01):**  and your work a little bit about your background and how you got started in natural building  
**[0:04:05-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:04:05):**  trades?  
**[0:04:07-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:04:07):**  Of course.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:04:08):**  Yeah, I'd be happy to.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:04:09):**  Well, I didn't come into it like a lot of people being interested in it.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:04:16):**  I was just born into it.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:04:20):**  So my parents are big natural builders, Bill and Athena Steen who've written books on straw  
**[0:04:26-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:04:26):**  builds.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:04:27):**  And they've also been on your podcast here.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:04:28):**  At least my dad has.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:04:30):**  Yeah, they have.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:04:31):**  I know I just can't find the time yet to synchronize schedules with your mom, but we'll get around  
**[0:04:35-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:04:35):**  to it.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:04:36):**  Oh yeah, that would be great.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:04:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:04:38):**  I'm going to put my voice on here.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:04:41):**  But yeah, ever since I was just as a kid, always hanging around the job sites.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:04:49):**  My parents' job sites from Mexico to the States.  
**[0:04:53-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:04:53):**  So it was never like, I can't even really distinctly remember a moment of when you first  
**[0:05:01-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:05:01):**  put your hands in mud.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:05:04):**  But it just, it always being around.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:05:06):**  Yeah, you must have come up with that association of like, you know, a lot of the things that  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:05:12):**  kids who grew up kind of in a kind of a more urban or a little bit more removed from nature  
**[0:05:18-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:05:18):**  environments.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:05:19):**  You know, we all play in the mud and we play in sandboxes and everybody has this introduction  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:05:23):**  to this, but you must have sort of made that association super early on that this isn't  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:05:27):**  just something that is apart from your life, but is intricately linked to it because you  
**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:05:32):**  were living in these types of structures all growing up too.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:05:36):**  Yeah it wasn't separated.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:05:38):**  I think the big change was maybe to have been put like, do you have a tool put in your hand  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:05:44):**  and realize that you can do a lot more with these things early on?  
**[0:05:49-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:05:49):**  My grandmother, you know, first like put that trowel in my hand when I was eight.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:05:56):**  And in some ways it's much easier to like learn some of those things like plastering  
**[0:06:02-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:06:02):**  when you're that young because it's more like plastering is much more like a language where  
**[0:06:11-0:06:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:06:11):**  it's not as theoretical of a skill.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:06:19):**  It's just more the feeling and like that action.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:06:21):**  I think it's been a lot to me trying to teach people like thinking about how to try to get  
**[0:06:29-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:06:29):**  people back to that like child place and not be so conscious in their movements, but actually  
**[0:06:35-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:06:35):**  being more aware as they do that.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:06:37):**  But anyway, that's kind of, that's like the basics of where I started into natural building.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:06:45):**  I went into trades too early on when I was, I never went to school so I was homeschooled  
**[0:06:51-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:06:51):**  and when I somehow at some point I decided I was like interested in metal just because  
**[0:06:57-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:06:57):**  it was just like this far, like this material that was just so far out there.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:07:03):**  And my mom like just knew just one of the best blacksmiths in the world, Tom Joyce,  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:07:08):**  and he just got the MacArthur grant.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:07:11):**  And so up there I went, I was sent off to like, you know, apprentice with Tom Joyce  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:07:15):**  for two years in a row learning blacksmithing and that's what I thought I was going to do.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:07:21):**  You know, later on I figure out that like, you know, metal's kind of, it's really hard  
**[0:07:25-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:07:25):**  and it's dirty and hot work and you're like, well, you know what, I kind of like clay actually.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:07:32):**  That's hilarious.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:07:33):**  It keeps going all the way to metal to make clay and mud look like the cleaner and the  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:07:38):**  more comfortable of the options that you have.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:07:42):**  I love that because I've played around with metal a little bit.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:07:44):**  I used to work on ships.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:07:45):**  I did a lot of welding there and I like, I never went through like a trades level, but  
**[0:07:50-0:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:07:50):**  definitely transitioning from that and working closer to nature was a very similar association  
**[0:07:56-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:07:56):**  for me.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:07:57):**  I was like, yeah, this is kind of an environment that I would like to spend more time in and  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:08:00):**  there's still a ton of options for what you can make with it.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:08:04):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:08:06):**  It's, it's something I like to go back to, but now more as like a hobby.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:08:10):**  Sure.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:08:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:08:12):**  I'd rather just spend my time with like mud in my hands if I have to.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:08:16):**  So tell me a little bit about like how growing up around all of these trades and seeing some  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:08:21):**  of the beautiful works of art that can be made with materials all around you.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:08:26):**  I mean, this was a big part of your environment.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:08:28):**  What was it that you really latched onto personally?  
**[0:08:31-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:08:31):**  Was it being able to build entire structures?  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:08:34):**  I know you do a lot with finish work and sort of more artistic elements of this.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:08:38):**  Where is kind of like your, your inspiration around this really stem from?  
**[0:08:43-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:08:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:08:45):**  I don't think it's, yeah, since it wasn't, it wasn't, since I was born into it, it is  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:08:50):**  a little different that I wasn't coming at it from like a green aspect.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:08:54):**  You know, a kid doesn't like think about, oh yeah, I'm doing this because it's, because  
**[0:08:59-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:08:59):**  this is like the sustainable green option.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:09:02):**  Sure.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:09:03):**  You know, kids just like, you're just, you're inspired by making something beautiful and  
**[0:09:11-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:09:11):**  making art, right, out of something.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:09:14):**  And so, yeah, I think that's, that's, that's still kind of what I, that's what I really  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:09:20):**  enjoy doing is just trying to make something beautiful.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:09:25):**  And I think that's a lot of how people know.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:09:26):**  And if the material is like enjoyable to work with, but yeah, if it also, if that material  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:09:31):**  is just enjoyable to work with too, then you're naturally going to be drawn to using those  
**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:09:37):**  things.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:09:39):**  And I think that's a lot of how people sort of know your work right now, or at least like  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:09:43):**  in the circles that I communicate with and some people who've reached out to me through  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:09:47):**  the podcast have asked me to interview you because of some of the videos that you've  
**[0:09:51-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:09:51):**  made doing the Doro Dango, the polished plasters, and that tutorial video of a bunch of different  
**[0:09:57-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:09:57):**  types of natural building methods.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:10:00):**  Tell me a little bit about how the aesthetic element of working with natural materials  
**[0:10:05-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:10:05):**  has become, I guess, sort of a trademark of your work at this point.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:10:10):**  Hmm.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:10:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:10:12):**  I think it, well, I think it just lends itself to something that we haven't, that people  
**[0:10:18-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:10:18):**  don't see on the average basis because there's just so, well, there one is to say, I guess  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:10:25):**  said to be, there's just so much beauty to drawn out of like just natural materials and  
**[0:10:30-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:10:30):**  to, so I think it's really easy to, it's really easy to bring people into that, into that  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:10:40):**  world, I guess, but I'm not sure exactly how to answer that one.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:10:44):**  No, no, that's fair.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:10:45):**  It's kind of an abstract question.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:10:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:10:49):**  Going back to one of the things that you said earlier about how you connected with this  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:10:51):**  at like an early age and it's kind of hard to go from there and teach people who are  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:10:56):**  maybe coming into it for the first time how to feel and connect with these materials and  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:11:01):**  these techniques and processes that maybe by now you just kind of have down to muscle  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:11:05):**  memory because you've done it for so long.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:11:08):**  So tell me a little bit more about that challenge and some of the ways that you help people  
**[0:11:12-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:11:12):**  connect away from just perhaps looking at it as recipes and techniques to start from  
**[0:11:19-0:11:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:11:19):**  the beginning.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:11:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:11:22):**  I've been trying to figure out more and more how to like try to get people out of there  
**[0:11:28-0:11:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:11:28):**  being really aware as they, as they touch the material and move it on a wall.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:11:35):**  And I think maybe more like a child is, a lot of people want to say, okay, well what's  
**[0:11:40-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:11:40):**  the movement I'm supposed to do here and how, you know, again, what is the recipe to like  
**[0:11:46-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:11:46):**  making a nice, like a nice, a nice curve or a surface, right?  
**[0:11:54-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:11:54):**  And there is no, it's really, it just, there is no like one move to be done there.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:12:01):**  You have to, you definitely have to, there's this communication of like picking up the  
**[0:12:09-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:12:09):**  material and feeling it and seeing it, this back and forth that goes with the clay definitely.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:12:17):**  And a little bit more so in those, it's a great place to start like learning how to  
**[0:12:23-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:12:23):**  manipulate material for it to like, to start that communication with it because it's something  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:12:31):**  that we can touch and it's something that we can, we can even put in our mouths.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:12:36):**  We can, we can feel it.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:12:38):**  We can, you're supposed to like hear it, feel it, even taste it, right?  
**[0:12:44-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:12:44):**  And that's when, that's having all those sensory, all those senses open is definitely what it  
**[0:12:52-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:12:52):**  takes to try to like get somebody actually like plastering, for example.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:12:58):**  So I'm still experimenting with that too, like trying to figure out how to open that  
**[0:13:01-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:13:01):**  up and get people to really be present, yeah.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:13:07):**  Yeah, that is a big part of it.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:13:10):**  And it's something that I'm having to completely relearn now that I've settled in a new place.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:13:14):**  I just, it's been a little bit over a month that I moved here to Spain and the difference  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:13:19):**  between this climate and this geology and the resources around me here and not to say  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:13:25):**  nothing of the regulations and what you're allowed to do, different from where I was  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:13:29):**  in the mountains of Guatemala for about two and a half years before this and a lot of  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:13:33):**  the different places that I've traveled.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:13:36):**  I'm wondering from your experience, since you've done a lot of traveling and taught  
**[0:13:39-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:13:39):**  in many different places, what each different locale maybe has taught you or what you've  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:13:45):**  learned to recognize either in patterns or some of the questions and investigations that  
**[0:13:50-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:13:50):**  you kind of do from the beginning in order to get yourself a little more familiar with  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:13:54):**  the differences of the place that you're working in?  
**[0:13:57-0:14:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:13:57):**  Oh man, there's just so much when you like, when you travel, as you can relate, like how  
**[0:14:04-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:14:04):**  much you, how much you learn from people who've either been there for a long time or new people  
**[0:14:11-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:14:11):**  who've come into that spot and ideas and patterns and designs and also the challenges, of course,  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:14:21):**  like you're saying, I'm sure like the challenge, with the challenges comes so much more understanding  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:14:27):**  of the materials around you.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:14:31):**  Teaching always helps too because you're just teaching in a new place where you have these  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:14:34):**  challenges of, you know, a dirt that doesn't break down or, and then they try to think  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:14:40):**  about why it's not breaking down.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:14:42):**  And sometimes in that whole process, you kind of, you gain, yeah, you gain so much in the  
**[0:14:52-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:14:52):**  understanding of what it is when you try to, yeah, when you try to put it all together.  
**[0:14:58-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:14:58):**  Sure.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:14:59):**  We also end up bringing the students with you in the investigation process, right?  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:15:03):**  Because it's one thing if you have kind of everything already set, you've got your clay,  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:15:08):**  you've got your sand or whatever, even sometimes in bags and you just show them how to put  
**[0:15:12-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:15:12):**  it together is one thing.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:15:13):**  But if they go back to their place and they don't have access to the same materials, like  
**[0:15:17-0:15:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:15:17):**  what is the analysis process that's going to bring them to an understanding of how to  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:15:23):**  mix those things together, what the textures they're looking for, why they shouldn't be  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:15:28):**  surprised when one clay that feels the same dry as the one that they used before all of  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:15:33):**  a sudden like cracks like crazy when it dries on the wall and what they should do about  
**[0:15:38-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:15:38):**  it.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:15:39):**  Like it really is an investigative process and it can be really frustrating sometimes  
**[0:15:44-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:15:44):**  because you kind of have to start over again every time you get to a new place.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:15:47):**  I'm sure you can relate.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:15:49):**  But it also, I don't know, it's like for me, it has always kept me on my toes.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:15:55):**  Like I get to come into it like a kid again for each time and see what's different and  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:16:01):**  you end up just having to play around a lot, you know, it's like it's built into the job  
**[0:16:05-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:16:05):**  description is just playing and experimenting.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:16:07):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:16:08):**  Yeah, it's definitely part of the part of the game.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:16:13):**  So what are some of the other things that you've learned through these different places  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:16:16):**  that you've gotten maybe away from the materials and the techniques specifically, but like  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:16:20):**  how different people and different cultures relate to natural building trades?  
**[0:16:25-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:16:25):**  Because I mean, I've seen a huge plethora of associations from, you know, people revering  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:16:31):**  it as sort of an ancestral technique that has kind of been lost to, you know, the other  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:16:36):**  far end spectrum of it's like it's completely devalued because the value has now been put  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:16:42):**  on cement and steel and, you know, industrial products.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:16:46):**  Have you learned much from the differences in the way those cultural aspects of natural  
**[0:16:50-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:16:50):**  building have kind of manifested in where you've gone?  
**[0:16:53-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:16:53):**  Yeah, it is.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:16:55):**  It's fun to watch how people approach it.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:16:59):**  I think I see this mostly through my YouTube videos these days in the comments from either  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:17:06):**  people around the world or people even in the, you know, in my country in the States.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:17:10):**  But yeah, you hear the same thing, the extremes from, yeah, people really interested in like  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:17:21):**  that you're, that you built, you still build those Adobe houses and you explain to them  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:17:25):**  that's what you do in the States when traveling somewhere in like Peru or something like that.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:17:30):**  And the fascination that like the taxi cab driver gives you to somebody just being like,  
**[0:17:38-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:17:38):**  well, yeah, why are you doing that?  
**[0:17:40-0:17:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:17:40):**  Why are you going backwards?  
**[0:17:43-0:17:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:17:43):**  Like you're trying to reinvent the wheel here or something.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:17:51):**  I remembered working on a project in Senegal and we were building a cob house for a client  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:17:56):**  out there first through a workshop and then with the local crew that kind of stayed on  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:18:01):**  to help.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:18:02):**  And we had so many neighbors coming by wondering like, is it going to get too cold in there?  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:18:07):**  Is it going to fall over as soon as the rains come and stuff?  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:18:11):**  And I was like, man, there's a whole bunch of buildings done with mud like this, like  
**[0:18:16-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:18:16):**  a couple miles south of here.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:18:18):**  And they've been there for a really long time.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:18:21):**  I'm also willing to bet that almost all of your ancestors, including maybe one or two  
**[0:18:27-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:18:27):**  generations moved, lived like this.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:18:29):**  And it's interesting to see how quickly the doubt and how quickly they kind of forget  
**[0:18:34-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:18:34):**  that these are perfectly valid and frankly much more proven building methods in most  
**[0:18:42-0:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:18:42):**  cases than these kind of ramshackle cement boxes, many of which, I mean, those were falling  
**[0:18:49-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:18:49):**  apart and those had only been up for a couple of years.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:18:52):**  It's funny to me how it's not given the same scrutiny as anything from the past.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:18:59):**  There's no one size fits all building material anywhere, whether it's industrial or whether  
**[0:19:05-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:19:05):**  it's old.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:19:06):**  And for some reason, the scrutiny is only put on the older methods as if these newer  
**[0:19:12-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:19:12):**  ones had been tried and tested for a longer period of time.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:19:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:19:17):**  I noticed, I had a workshop with my dad like two years back in Mexico and it was fun.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:19:23):**  It was like a hundred, like a crew of a hundred people on this site, you know, Mexican workers.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:19:32):**  And they were doing all these structures out of earth and lime and masonry and some wood.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:19:39):**  But the workshop was just geared towards these 10, like the 10 leader, like the 10 top construction  
**[0:19:50-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:19:50):**  guys.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:19:53):**  So we just got the, you know, the, like the masters of the masters.  
**[0:19:58-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:19:58):**  And it was so fun.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:19:59):**  It was the first time I think I've ever taught a class like that for sure, because it's like  
**[0:20:03-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:20:03):**  teaching construction workers, but the interest these guys were showed right away, like they  
**[0:20:11-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:20:11):**  followed you every single word by like, just like with like full awareness and attention,  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:20:18):**  just like how, like, how are we going to learn?  
**[0:20:20-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:20:20):**  What are we, what are we doing?  
**[0:20:22-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:20:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:20:23):**  So I've never, you've never, I've never seen a, yeah, a class more attentive and like eager.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:20:31):**  Sure.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:20:32):**  That was, that was an amazing one to see.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:20:35):**  You know, I haven't spent a whole lot of time in Mexico, but the little bit of time that  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:20:39):**  I have, the people that I've met seem to be way more switched on to this kind of stuff  
**[0:20:44-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:20:44):**  than perhaps in other regions of the world that I've gone.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:20:47):**  Like for some reason in Southeast Asia, mostly is where I've seen like, I don't want to say  
**[0:20:53-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:20:53):**  a disregard, but kind of a lack of interest, partly because there's not a huge earth and  
**[0:20:58-0:21:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:20:58):**  building tradition in a lot of those regions.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:21:00):**  A lot of it was more like around the hardwoods from the jungles that used to be there or  
**[0:21:05-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:21:05):**  bamboo in a lot of cases, especially because they get super, super heavy weather and it  
**[0:21:12-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:21:12):**  kind of made a lot more sense to build somewhat temporary structures and have to replace them  
**[0:21:18-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:21:18):**  every handful of seasons.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:21:20):**  Whereas places I think that, that have larger swings in temperature and maybe less, less  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:21:27):**  severe weather events, it makes more sense to build for the longer term and then just  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:21:32):**  have maybe a roof or something that gets replaced over time or that gets maintained more often.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:21:37):**  And I'm still trying to figure that out.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:21:39):**  I mean, I've read some books about it, but it's hard to take on a case by case basis,  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:21:43):**  but it's just like, you know, different observations that I'm trying to put together and make more  
**[0:21:47-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:21:47):**  sense of because I mean, every place has its cultural context and history to draw from.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:21:56):**  And it seems to affect that, but not only that, but like the modern economy and the  
**[0:22:01-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:22:01):**  drive and like the cultural narrative in modernity as well, that I guess promotes the value of  
**[0:22:09-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:22:09):**  certain things over others.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:22:10):**  But maybe I'm getting a little too abstract now.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:22:13):**  Is there much, is there much natural, what kind of natural buildings are in Spain at  
**[0:22:18-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:22:18):**  the moment?  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:22:19):**  Well, there's a lot of preservation of old structures here.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:22:23):**  I spent the first month volunteering at another site that a couple of guys were restoring  
**[0:22:32-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:22:32):**  an old messiah, which is an old farmhouse.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:22:35):**  It was mostly built from stone, it was about 250 years old.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:22:39):**  And it was a matter of like protecting the wooden vigas that were keeping the roof up  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:22:44):**  and were starting to rot a little bit from lack of maintenance and trying to see if they  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:22:49):**  could like open up some windows or redo some of the plasters that had started to come down,  
**[0:22:54-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:22:54):**  partly because like some newer ones were done poorly with cement.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:22:57):**  But there is, there's a lot of effort to restore old, especially stone and brick buildings  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:23:03):**  around here is what I've seen.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:23:05):**  Yeah, I could imagine that.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:23:08):**  And there also seems to be some interest in bringing in straw bale and slip straw wall  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:23:14):**  systems here too, because as good as the stone is for a lot of things, depending on where  
**[0:23:18-0:23:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:23:18):**  you are in the region, the lack of insulation in these buildings can be really tough for  
**[0:23:24-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:23:24):**  energy efficiency.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:23:25):**  Of course.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:23:26):**  And there is still a lot of grain production in different areas because, I mean, due to  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:23:32):**  a couple hundred years of deforestation, the land isn't that great for much else in a lot  
**[0:23:37-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:23:37):**  of places.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:23:38):**  And a lot of water resources, especially in the center of the country, seems to be a big  
**[0:23:43-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:23:43):**  driver for things like this.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:23:44):**  So there is a lot of like grain straw to be had, I think.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:23:49):**  But I'm just kind of getting into like where these things are popular and where they're  
**[0:23:54-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:23:54):**  permitted and allowed to.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:23:56):**  So I'm just kind of starting to scratch the surface.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:23:58):**  But certainly if anybody is listening to this and they know of any resources in Spain, definitely  
**[0:24:03-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:24:03):**  hit me up.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:24:04):**  Leave something in the comments or send me an email.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:24:08):**  Yeah, it's only been a month you've been there, you said.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:24:11):**  Just a little over a month.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:24:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:24:13):**  And I spent most of that time like volunteering with those guys to learn a little bit more  
**[0:24:17-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:24:17):**  about the structures that are already around, because there are a lot of protections in  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:24:24):**  this region about like where you can build and density.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:24:28):**  So you could buy a piece of land, but it's totally illegal to build anything on it.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:24:32):**  So it seems kind of for a longer term plan for myself and my partner here, it might be  
**[0:24:37-0:24:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:24:37):**  to renovate an existing building and maybe do some renovations and add-ons to it.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:24:43):**  And so I kind of wanted to learn about how that works with, because I haven't spent that  
**[0:24:48-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:24:48):**  much time in stone buildings.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:24:49):**  I've definitely spent time in earthen buildings and a lot of wooden structures, especially  
**[0:24:54-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:24:54):**  in the north of the United States.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:24:56):**  Well, when you get down to it, if you're talking about COB or Adobe, you're really talking  
**[0:25:04-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:25:04):**  about masonry buildings.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:25:06):**  Sure.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:25:07):**  Thermal mass, big time.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:25:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:25:09):**  Big, thick walls.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:25:10):**  It's just the stones are a lot smaller.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:25:12):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:25:14):**  So they're really, they are kind of stone buildings.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:25:17):**  What I've been impressed to see is like the stonework is, I don't want to say it's bad.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:25:23):**  It's definitely not bad, but it's not as precise or it's not as sturdy as I would have thought  
**[0:25:31-0:25:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:25:31):**  it was maybe from pictures looking from a distance.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:25:35):**  But they don't have any earthquakes here, which is a context that's totally new to me  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:25:39):**  because when I was in the Philippines and when I was in Guatemala, especially, that  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:25:43):**  was the major thing that we had to build to.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:25:47):**  And you can't just slap together some sand and lime mortar and just chunk a whole bunch  
**[0:25:56-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:25:56):**  of rocks in to form a wall.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:25:57):**  It wouldn't hold more than a season, right?  
**[0:26:00-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:26:00):**  But here they've got like five to 800 year old medieval castles that are built like this.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:26:06):**  And you can go over to the wall and kind of pick and scratch a little bit at the mortar  
**[0:26:10-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:26:10):**  and it kind of crumbles.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:26:11):**  It sort of blew my mind.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:26:14):**  It's like the climate here and the lack of earthquakes and the lack of major storms and  
**[0:26:18-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:26:18):**  it's like, yeah, it's going to be here forever.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:26:20):**  You just have to keep the roof on.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:26:23):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:26:24):**  That's pretty amazing.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:26:25):**  And you don't even have snow loads or anything.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:26:27):**  No, nothing.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:26:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:26:29):**  I mean, not until you get up into the pyramids, but I think you start to find more, I think  
**[0:26:33-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:26:33):**  you should start to find more wooden structures as you get up that region too.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:26:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:26:37):**  It's fascinating because I've never spent any real time investigating the buildings  
**[0:26:42-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:26:42):**  in Europe.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:26:43):**  And my travels up until now have always been on other continents.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:26:46):**  Like Europe is one of the places that I've explored the least.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:26:49):**  So a lot to learn, but like super, super old, rich building history in these areas.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:26:56):**  And like you can go super far back with the plaster techniques.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:26:59):**  I mean, I'm sure you've researched and seen stuff from like old Italian plaster traditions  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:27:05):**  and there's a whole guild just online plastering techniques and restoration in England that  
**[0:27:09-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:27:09):**  has a good website.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:27:10):**  There's really cool resources.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:27:12):**  Yeah, I know.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:27:13):**  It's an amazing approach.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:27:15):**  It's completely different from how we approach it here and then just a long masonry history.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:27:26):**  And so how they approach even lime or clay, it's completely different from maybe where  
**[0:27:34-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:27:34):**  more recently, like my parents have gotten a lot of their inspiration from Japan and  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:27:38):**  Japanese stuff and then native stuff.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:27:42):**  So that seemed to relate a little bit more somewhat.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:27:46):**  It kind of depends on where you are, but yeah, a little bit more towards the fiber end and  
**[0:27:49-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:27:49):**  those guys are.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:27:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:27:52):**  I learned a lot about that through the interview with Kyle Holtz-Huter.  
**[0:27:56-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:27:56):**  I'm sure.  
**[0:27:57-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:27:57):**  Have you talked to him or met him?  
**[0:27:59-0:28:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:27:59):**  I know you guys both taught courses at Masatau.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:28:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:28:03):**  I've known him since I was young.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:28:05):**  Oh, that's awesome.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:28:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:28:08):**  I must have been when I was 16 originally.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:28:10):**  Yeah, I learned so much from that interview.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:28:13):**  I didn't realize that the fiber-based plasters over there were such a big thing and that  
**[0:28:17-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:28:17):**  I can't think of anywhere else other than Japan where you could just buy huge tons of  
**[0:28:23-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:28:23):**  already chopped straw fibers.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:28:25):**  Yeah, in different sizes.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:28:27):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:28:28):**  It's not a product you can get anywhere else.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:28:30):**  That's amazing.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:28:33):**  If you're in Europe, some places just like what exact sand size you want, you can go  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:28:38):**  ahead and buy the bag of sand at exactly this size.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:28:42):**  Exactly.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:28:43):**  In this size.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:28:44):**  Well, in this region, because we're not far from the Mediterranean, I'm just about 30  
**[0:28:48-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:28:48):**  minutes outside of Barcelona.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:28:50):**  Oh, cool.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:28:51):**  Yeah, the earth is super sandy around here and I've yet to find a really good deposit  
**[0:28:56-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:28:56):**  of clay.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:28:57):**  So, it's like, okay, there goes a whole bunch of techniques that I thought I knew.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:29:03):**  So, yeah, it's just a matter of figuring out what the resources here are and how to  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:29:09):**  put them together because I don't even find that much stone until you go up into the mountains.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:29:14):**  It seems to already have been mostly used for the existing buildings.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:29:18):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:29:20):**  Wow.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:29:21):**  That is interesting that you wouldn't see the stone because it's all been taken.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:29:27):**  Almost.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:29:28):**  I mean, I'm sure it's not all been taken, but you also can't just walk onto any land  
**[0:29:31-0:29:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:29:31):**  and grab a bunch of stones either.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:29:34):**  As much as I'd love to do that.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:29:35):**  Start your quarry.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:29:36):**  Sure.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:29:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:29:38):**  I mean, it's something you kind of forget about, especially both of us growing up in  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:29:42):**  the United States.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:29:43):**  There's just so much BLM land and places along the side of the highway where you can  
**[0:29:48-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:29:48):**  just go and grab stuff.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:29:50):**  And I know there's much less populated areas.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:29:52):**  Like technically, I'm still in the suburbs of Barcelona.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:29:55):**  So all the land for the most part is used if it's not national parks.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:30:00):**  But I can't just go around and forage earth and materials around here.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:30:04):**  Not really.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:30:05):**  Not in the daytime.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:30:07):**  No.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:30:08):**  No, it's a real luxury building this house in New Mexico where we could just grab the  
**[0:30:16-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:30:16):**  rock on site.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:30:17):**  I actually got to do my first bit of stonemasonry, milling up stone and so on.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:30:23):**  Oh, man.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:30:24):**  I love that.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:30:25):**  And that's how I first really connected with natural materials is I started building trails  
**[0:30:30-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:30:30):**  in national parks around the Four Corners region.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:30:33):**  And it was all stonework.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:30:34):**  And so yeah, getting into foundations and stuff was really fun for me.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:30:39):**  It was only later that I learned how to work with earth.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:30:42):**  So actually, let's start from the beginning.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:30:44):**  Why don't you tell our listeners a little bit about this project that you've been working  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:30:47):**  on and the context and the materials and things to catch them up to speed.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:30:52):**  Oh, yeah, of course.  
**[0:30:54-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:30:54):**  Yeah, this is just a small off-grid cabin for some folks who want to eventually build  
**[0:31:04-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:31:04):**  maybe another little cabin out there and spend their whole time out there.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:31:07):**  But I just came back from that job.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:31:14):**  Now it's the second summer on it, so it's slow moving, but it's really beautiful.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:31:20):**  We've gathered so far the rocks on site and built the foundation.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:31:25):**  We built the foundation out of the sandstone and the granite footing on the whole thing  
**[0:31:29-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:31:29):**  it sits on.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:31:31):**  And the adobes are, the whole thing is trying to make a film out of it is the idea too as  
**[0:31:35-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:31:35):**  well.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:31:36):**  So we'll see how that comes.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:31:37):**  It's been kind of a long tedious process trying to film a whole house.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:31:40):**  It's exciting.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:31:42):**  Yeah, it is really exciting if it comes through, which kind of it's trying to show the forging  
**[0:31:49-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:31:49):**  of the chisel, which is where we're trying to start, you know, like forging of the chisel  
**[0:31:53-0:32:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:31:53):**  to like cut the stone to bring in, like seeing the adobes being made right there, like just  
**[0:32:00-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:32:00):**  45 minutes away to cutting the timbers for the roof.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:32:06):**  Oh, yeah.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:32:07):**  Yeah, just showing a lot more of not just the building of it, but the processing of  
**[0:32:13-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:32:13):**  these materials and all this kind of stuff that kind of goes.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:32:16):**  Which is super important to show.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:32:17):**  I'm really glad you guys are taking the time to do that because I think that's the part  
**[0:32:21-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:32:21):**  that's maybe most overlooked that I've found in teaching and working with people who are  
**[0:32:25-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:32:25):**  new to natural building is realizing that, you know, because you're not purchasing things  
**[0:32:31-0:32:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:32:31):**  that are pre-processed, there's a whole lot of steps that go into making raw materials  
**[0:32:37-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:32:37):**  ready to use as construction materials.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:32:39):**  And you're like, that's the trade off, right?  
**[0:32:43-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:32:43):**  You may be paying less or getting your stuff for free, but there's this whole other process  
**[0:32:47-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:32:47):**  that's involved in creating something out of it.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:32:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:32:52):**  Yeah, so your material budget goes way down as far as what you spent on materials.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:32:57):**  But I mean, you're spending a lot on labor, but it...  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:33:00):**  Yeah, either if you're hiring it or if you just, you have to budget for time, right?  
**[0:33:05-0:33:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:33:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:33:06):**  But yeah, it's really fun, beautiful project so far just to live off grid up there as well.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:33:13):**  And yeah, look for the film.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:33:16):**  I mean, it'd probably be a whole nother year before you got a film on it, but yeah.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:33:22):**  So how long have you been working on it up until now?  
**[0:33:25-0:33:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:33:25):**  And how long do you budget out for the future before it's finished?  
**[0:33:31-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:33:31):**  It's not much more time left in it.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:33:33):**  It's probably been, it's kind of a three month so far work into it roughly.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:33:41):**  And it's probably got about a month left in it.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:33:43):**  And it's only about 400 square feet.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:33:48):**  And pretty complex as far as the roof and window and all these details go.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:33:54):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:33:55):**  That's what takes up the time.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:33:56):**  Well, so I'm curious if you feel comfortable talking about it, tell me a little about your  
**[0:34:00-0:34:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:34:00):**  process working with the clients from either the point where they contact you, I don't  
**[0:34:05-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:34:05):**  know if you knew them from before, to forming an idea and working with their needs, their  
**[0:34:10-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:34:10):**  context, their desires for a living space, and kind of how you come to agreements about  
**[0:34:16-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:34:16):**  what you're able to offer.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:34:17):**  I mean, we don't have to go into any details about compensation and stuff, but I think  
**[0:34:22-0:34:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:34:22):**  it's really good for people who are starting to think about this as perhaps a vocation,  
**[0:34:28-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:34:28):**  sort of the process of bringing a client through concept all the way to coming up with an agreement  
**[0:34:36-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:34:36):**  to like how you guys are going to build it.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:34:39):**  Yeah, I mean, that is a tough one.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:34:42):**  I mean, it's super different for each context, I'm sure.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:34:45):**  I mean, it has been for me, but...  
**[0:34:47-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:34:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:34:48):**  Well, I think just that whole relationship is, it's always draining on me at least.  
**[0:34:57-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:34:57):**  It's surprisingly intimate is what I found.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:34:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:35:00):**  Like you really, you end up spending a lot of time...  
**[0:35:02-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:35:02):**  I've realized how much more walls I put up instantly these days.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:35:08):**  I slowly have to drop them and become more sociable again.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:35:13):**  Sure, sure.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:35:14):**  But yeah, how traumatized you get a little bit overly, like having clients and more clients  
**[0:35:20-0:35:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:35:20):**  and houses, there's just so much...  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:35:26):**  I mean, ignorance is just so bliss.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:35:30):**  You could just go back to not really worrying about rain and all these potential callbacks.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:35:41):**  And especially when it comes to earthen plasters and finishes like that, who else are they  
**[0:35:48-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:35:48):**  going to call?  
**[0:35:49-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:35:49):**  Right.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:35:50):**  Well, the thing is, you've taken on so much.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:35:52):**  You're the one who has to come back here.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:35:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:55-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:35:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:56-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:35:56):**  Well, you've taken on so much.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:35:57):**  And you're giving an entire build from start to finish all the way through plasters and  
**[0:36:01-0:36:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:36:01):**  stuff.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:36:02):**  I mean, there's a reason why other trades people have subcontractors and have a lot  
**[0:36:07-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:36:07):**  of other people do those parts.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:36:08):**  I mean, it's a huge undertaking, not just in time, but in thought and planning.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:36:14):**  Is it something that you look forward to taking on these all-encompassing projects?  
**[0:36:18-0:36:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:36:18):**  Or do you prefer to do things a little bit more piecemeal, like maybe just plasters or  
**[0:36:23-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:36:23):**  just putting up walls, for example?  
**[0:36:26-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:36:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:36:27):**  I wouldn't take this kind of a project on unless I had the right clients.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:36:34):**  And in this case, I do.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:36:35):**  I have just loving, caring people who put their faith in me.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:36:43):**  And in turn, I'll do everything for them.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:36:47):**  But that's far, few in between to find somebody who's going to take that leap of faith.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:36:56):**  You're talking about just a lot of money, and you're talking about something that can  
**[0:37:02-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:37:02):**  just go really wrong really fast.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:37:08):**  So those things can go.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:37:10):**  I've had a lot of...  
**[0:37:16-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:37:16):**  It's nice to find people who are really supportive and helpful there in that process in whatever  
**[0:37:21-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:37:21):**  way they can be.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:37:23):**  A lot of people start off thinking that it's just going to be this thing that they're going  
**[0:37:27-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:37:27):**  to help you with, and they're going to build it half themselves.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:37:32):**  That's never the case.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:37:33):**  They end up not doing any of the work or something.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:37:37):**  I've definitely had that.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:37:39):**  We're like, oh, we really want you to help walk us through building our own house.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:37:44):**  And I'm like, okay, cool.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:37:46):**  Well, if you do this yourself, it's going to end up costing this much extra.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:37:52):**  Just because it's going to go that much slower.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:37:56):**  It's much more of a teaching process than at that point.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:38:00):**  In the few cases where I've had it shake out, they're like, oh, actually, can you just get  
**[0:38:05-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:38:05):**  a team on that?  
**[0:38:07-0:38:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:38:07):**  We actually don't really want to do this at all.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:38:10):**  It comes up, yeah.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:38:11):**  The reality sinks in, and then things change really fast.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:38:14):**  Yeah, I've had lots of those.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:38:18):**  Lots of them.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:38:21):**  So yeah, now you're still trying to figure it out exactly what kind of jobs I would take  
**[0:38:27-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:38:27):**  or not.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:38:30):**  But I am a little bit more invested in doing stuff that's like, now that I can kind of  
**[0:38:34-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:38:34):**  pick and choose sometimes what I do.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:38:37):**  I usually do like to pick something that I'm a little bit more involved.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:38:43):**  I get a lot of plaster projects that are through my buddy in Oakland who runs a company called  
**[0:38:55-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:38:55):**  Level Five.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:38:57):**  They're out of Oakland, and he does a lot of stuff for Google and Slack and all these  
**[0:39:06-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:39:06):**  big tech companies and stuff like that.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:39:09):**  It's fun to be just flown in for his projects as well, just to do some kind of conventional  
**[0:39:13-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:39:13):**  plaster, but in these art, these singular art pieces and stuff like that.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:39:19):**  So you're confronted with this nice challenge to make this super.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:39:26):**  I'm sure these walls are like $40,000 walls, some of them.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:39:30):**  Oh, yeah, easily.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:39:32):**  And those custom plaster jobs are not cheap.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:39:34):**  No, I meant just the plaster is probably $3,000.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:39:38):**  So tell me a little bit about your attraction to plaster and the aspects that you're exploring  
**[0:39:47-0:39:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:39:47):**  or most inspired by these days.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:39:49):**  Because I've seen this, the video that I really gravitated towards was the polished clay plaster  
**[0:39:56-0:40:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:39:56):**  one that you did, the red with, I can't remember what kind of oil you used on it, but it came  
**[0:40:01-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:40:01):**  out beautiful.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:40:03):**  How long does something like that take on a large wall and what are your interests in  
**[0:40:09-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:40:09):**  furthering the development of these types of aesthetics?  
**[0:40:12-0:40:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:40:12):**  Yeah, it's funny that some of these are more, I have hardly sometimes enough time to just  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:40:19):**  go experiment or I give myself so little time to just go do that.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:40:24):**  And it usually just comes up something new.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:40:27):**  So for example, that polished clay plaster, that was something, so it's something my dad  
**[0:40:34-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:40:34):**  had started and maybe it came from my mom's side of the family that always polished pottery.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:40:42):**  And then something my dad has done in the past.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:40:44):**  And I don't know exactly what my dad's approach or techniques were towards it.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:40:50):**  Maybe not quite as polished, but he's always had different, so there was not a question  
**[0:40:56-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:40:56):**  in my mind that I could just do it.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:40:57):**  But there's usually these few days before filming the video, I just say, okay, Panther,  
**[0:41:02-0:41:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:41:02):**  we're going to film a polished clay plaster video.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:41:05):**  And then I'm like, okay, wait, hold up.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:41:08):**  I need to figure out how I'm going to do it.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:41:13):**  So I spent a day or two figuring out how to do it and then I learned a whole bunch.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:41:17):**  Same thing actually happened with those Dorodongo video.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:41:21):**  I've made quite a few in the past, but my friend asked for a video on it and I was like,  
**[0:41:27-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:41:27):**  oh, that would make a good video.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:41:30):**  And so I was like, I know I need to learn how to make the way I want to show it.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:41:34):**  And so a week later, there's 50 Dorodongo, two weeks later more like, there's 50 Dorodongos  
**[0:41:47-0:41:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:41:47):**  laying around the living room.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:41:48):**  And now I've come up with a whole bunch of textures.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:41:52):**  Yeah that I really loved watching.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:41:53):**  Yeah, the ones with the string and the different stipplings.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:41:57):**  Yeah, that all just came out of just trying to like make a video on it sometimes.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:42:04):**  So those textures, for example, I was putting them on walls after that.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:42:09):**  So stuff like that, yeah, that definitely inspires me, but it's just so random what's  
**[0:42:15-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:42:15):**  going to fuel the next idea, right?  
**[0:42:18-0:42:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:42:18):**  That's really good that you have an outlet like that, that you can collaborate with your  
**[0:42:22-0:42:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:42:22):**  brother on with those videos, because it's probably a good incentive to try out new stuff.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:42:27):**  It gives it more than just like, oh, I'm going to do it to do it.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:42:30):**  It's like, well, I can maybe put out a finished product after the experimentation process,  
**[0:42:35-0:42:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:42:35):**  no?  
**[0:42:36-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:42:36):**  Yeah, it would be a little bit much to like, if I just were to go outside right now and  
**[0:42:40-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:42:40):**  go make a sample of something new.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:42:46):**  Yeah, if I've got like an experiment that I want to try, oftentimes I just won't finish  
**[0:42:51-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:42:51):**  it and just trying to figure out what I learned.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:42:54):**  But if I put it like, okay, I'm going to write an article about it, or if I'm going to do  
**[0:42:57-0:43:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:42:57):**  something with a finished product, it actually makes me take those last steps to get it done.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:43:02):**  Is that how that works for you?  
**[0:43:04-0:43:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:43:04):**  Oh, totally.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:43:05):**  Yeah, no, it's been great.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:43:08):**  Yeah, going that extra step.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:43:11):**  Being in other places sometimes, like the ranch, Rancho Masatala, just to be able to  
**[0:43:19-0:43:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:43:19):**  spend some time there and like, you know, decide that they want like a special plaster  
**[0:43:26-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:43:26):**  over here and to be able to spend that extra time making something creative.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:43:31):**  That's another good spot to bring in a little bit of some new ideas and new textures or  
**[0:43:38-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:43:38):**  new ways to bring walls to life, really showcase the materials.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:43:48):**  And so are there any other techniques or I guess skills around natural building, especially  
**[0:43:53-0:43:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:43:53):**  plaster work that you're excited to learn or that you haven't tried out yet that you  
**[0:43:57-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:43:57):**  want to get your hands on?  
**[0:43:58-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:43:58):**  Oh yeah, I mean, that one is just so unlimited that there's always just so much to learn.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:44:07):**  Yeah, I really would like to spend more time with other experts too, who spent like most  
**[0:44:17-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:44:17):**  of their life doing plaster work.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:44:20):**  There's always so much to be gained there.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:44:23):**  Yeah, I really appreciate that.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:44:27):**  That aspect of it, more time just spent with doing stuff with clay and even limes and stuff  
**[0:44:34-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:44:34):**  like that.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:44:35):**  It's all very beneficial.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:44:38):**  Seems like I'm never, it never stops.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:44:41):**  Yeah, just continually gaining a lot of knowledge in that aspect.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:44:49):**  It's not slowing down in returns like a lot of things sometimes.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:44:54):**  Yeah, I can imagine.  
**[0:44:56-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:44:56):**  No, I'm the same way as like, especially around these things that we're talking about.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:45:00):**  The more I learn, the more questions I end up having and the more I want to go a little  
**[0:45:04-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:45:04):**  bit deeper.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:45:05):**  And then it's just a matter of like, oh man, that's going to take a lot of time.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:45:08):**  How am I going to balance that with actually doing work for clients and these other things  
**[0:45:12-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:45:12):**  that actually pay?  
**[0:45:15-0:45:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:45:15):**  So to shift gears a little bit here, something that I'm starting to explore a little bit  
**[0:45:21-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:45:21):**  more, especially with people around natural building is like, you know, there's this whole  
**[0:45:26-0:45:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:45:26):**  range of different techniques that one can use.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:45:29):**  But no, like what I was saying with natural building, especially with all the interviews  
**[0:45:32-0:45:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:45:32):**  that I've done around this series, you know, it's one thing to identify the correct materials  
**[0:45:37-0:45:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:45:37):**  or the techniques for building a structure around, you know, your local area or within  
**[0:45:42-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:45:42):**  a historical context or whatever it might be.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:45:45):**  But there's this whole other idea around natural building that I think is possibly even more  
**[0:45:50-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:45:50):**  relevant, especially to our time and place is that there should be a change in lifestyle.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:45:55):**  You know, because if you're still living the same consumptive way and still relying on  
**[0:45:59-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:45:59):**  technology to kind of provide for you or the same economic systems that are incredibly  
**[0:46:04-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:46:04):**  unstable as your source of sustenance or livelihood, you know, the quality or the materials of  
**[0:46:12-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:46:12):**  your building might not make a big difference in the way that you live at the end.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:46:17):**  If you have any thoughts on that as like what it kind of means to make a shift to a more  
**[0:46:21-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:46:21):**  natural lifestyle or to depend a little bit more on the ecology and the community around  
**[0:46:28-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:46:28):**  you, is that something that you've learned kind of growing up in somewhat of an alternative  
**[0:46:33-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:46:33):**  way in the Southwest or has it become more kind of something that you've understood better  
**[0:46:39-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:46:39):**  as you've grown up and seen a lot of different examples of it?  
**[0:46:43-0:46:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:46:43):**  Yeah, I think it is a lot, it's definitely much easier to, they do go hand in hand and  
**[0:46:52-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:46:52):**  I agree with that.  
**[0:46:54-0:47:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:46:54):**  I couldn't be making the work I am in some ways without being like here or the house  
**[0:47:01-0:47:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:47:01):**  that I was working on for it not to be like also being living off grid out in my old,  
**[0:47:12-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:47:12):**  my grandmother's adobe cabins out there.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:47:14):**  But yeah, it just seems, I don't know if I would say I have much more to add, but that  
**[0:47:20-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:47:20):**  it just seems to go hand in hand with the space around you.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:47:26):**  So I mean, I know for you, this has been a lifestyle that you grew up with from the beginning  
**[0:47:30-0:47:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:47:30):**  and you know, I'm sure you've seen a lot of other ways, but it's kind of your norm.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:47:34):**  A lot of the other people that I talked to have kind of come through it from a perspective  
**[0:47:38-0:47:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:47:38):**  of having lived in a city or in a suburb or something, and this is a big transition for  
**[0:47:43-0:47:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:47:43):**  them.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:47:44):**  So maybe it's harder for you to think about what aspects of the lifestyle that goes along  
**[0:47:47-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:47:47):**  with it are kind of essential for your idea of what natural living is.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:47:52):**  But if you could maybe give some insight on these things that have been, I guess, kind  
**[0:47:58-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:47:58):**  of the main point of living in this alternative way or that you've noticed are missing perhaps  
**[0:48:05-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:48:05):**  when you go and visit either other communities or people with different lifestyles, what  
**[0:48:10-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:48:10):**  kind of stands out to you that feels disconnected from that perspective?  
**[0:48:15-0:48:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:48:15):**  Yeah, I think most of it is that I, for me and my work in making stuff has been, because  
**[0:48:25-0:48:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:48:25):**  I lived in Oakland for four years, Oakland and Berkeley in the Bay Area, and doing remodeling  
**[0:48:34-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:48:34):**  and commuting and like, I think, yeah, it definitely hit a switch there where I was  
**[0:48:41-0:48:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:48:41):**  just like, wow, I just am not, this is not satisfying my creative, like having the space  
**[0:48:52-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:48:52):**  to be creative.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:48:56):**  Or the resources sometimes a little bit that just comes with having space, the dirt and  
**[0:49:05-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:49:05):**  the grass that I can look outside and all these things I could make stuff out of.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:49:10):**  But yeah, I think that is the sense of losing, or you lose a little bit so much in having  
**[0:49:23-0:49:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:49:23):**  a schedule, as simply as that, just having your daily life go on and you have to be at  
**[0:49:32-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:49:32):**  work at this time.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:49:36):**  That simply does it for me, just being able to wake up and say, Panther, let's go record  
**[0:49:45-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:49:45):**  right now and make a video.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:49:50):**  Yeah, the freedom of time is a big difference, I've noticed as well.  
**[0:49:54-0:50:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:49:54):**  Although I have also had some pretty demanding schedules, like working in rural areas and  
**[0:50:02-0:50:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:50:02):**  like tending to a farm, especially when you have animals, man.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:50:06):**  There's no weekends when you have animals.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:50:13):**  We have a few ducks here, but it's pretty minor.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:50:16):**  Ducks are pretty low maintenance.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:50:17):**  I love ducks for that reason.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:50:20):**  They're pretty good foragers, they don't need a lot of attention.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:50:24):**  Undervalued for people who have yards and stuff.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:50:27):**  Chickens I think are a little bit higher maintenance than ducks are, even though they're not as  
**[0:50:30-0:50:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:50:30):**  wily.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:50:31):**  They're a little bit messier too, man.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:50:35):**  But they are a lot softer on a garden.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:50:38):**  They won't just tear up your beds the way that the chickens will.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:50:41):**  Oh yeah, I meant the chickens are dirtier.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:50:44):**  They'll just come poop in your shop and go poop over everything.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:50:50):**  Hey look, man, I'd love to keep talking for a really long time.  
**[0:50:56-0:50:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:50:56):**  I know we've got more to catch up on.  
**[0:50:57-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:50:57):**  Hopefully we can do another follow-up episode in the future.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:51:00):**  But for now, why don't you tell us if you've got workshops or other educational opportunities  
**[0:51:06-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:51:06):**  coming up and how people can contact you if they want to either learn more or learn more  
**[0:51:10-0:51:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:51:10):**  about your services as well.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:51:12):**  Yeah, well I've definitely encouraged everybody to go on to my YouTube channel, The Nito Project,  
**[0:51:21-0:51:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:51:21):**  NITO.  
**[0:51:25-0:51:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:51:25):**  And yeah, we've got a whole bunch of great videos on there.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:51:27):**  That's what we're kind of working on.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:51:28):**  That's what I'm most excited about working on.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:51:31):**  And otherwise, my parents' website is a great place to kind of check on workshops that I  
**[0:51:38-0:51:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:51:38):**  potentially have are usually listed on there, The Canelo Project.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:51:43):**  That's a good place to learn more about strawberry and plaster work.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:51:48):**  And I'll have a course also, maybe that's not listed on there yet.  
**[0:51:51-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:51:51):**  We'll be in Costa Rica in February, end of February.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:51:56):**  Just a general natural building one with Nick.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:52:00):**  Should be a great course.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:52:02):**  Yeah, those are the main spots for the most part.  
**[0:52:05-0:52:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:52:05):**  Yeah, well I'm really looking forward to seeing the other videos as they start to come out.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:52:10):**  And let's stay in touch to see if we can get together and collaborate on a project to see  
**[0:52:14-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:52:14):**  if we can either get you out to Spain or next time I'll be back down in that region as well.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:52:19):**  Because I missed the north or the southwest.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:52:21):**  I used to live, well I did all those trail projects in the Four Corners region and then  
**[0:52:26-0:52:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:52:26):**  I lived outside of Taos.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:52:28):**  Did you ever meet Carol Cruz at one of the building colloquiums?  
**[0:52:33-0:52:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:52:33):**  Yeah, yeah, of course.  
**[0:52:35-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:52:35):**  She was always around when I was a kid.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:52:37):**  Oh, she's awesome.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:52:38):**  She was my main teacher for plasters and alices and stuff.  
**[0:52:41-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:52:41):**  And that's really how I got exposed to Finnish work.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:52:44):**  And she really opened my eyes to a whole bunch of other techniques too when I thought that  
**[0:52:47-0:52:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:52:47):**  I was just going to focus on Cobb.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:52:49):**  That region is super dear to my heart as well.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:52:52):**  Yeah, awesome to be here.  
**[0:52:54-0:52:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:52:54):**  Yeah, it was such a pleasure having you.  
**[0:52:55-0:52:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-benito-steen/#t=0:52:55):**  Let's keep in touch.

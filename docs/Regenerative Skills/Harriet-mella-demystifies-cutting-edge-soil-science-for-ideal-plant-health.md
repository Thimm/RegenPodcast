**[0:03:33-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:03:33):**  Super.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:03:34):**  All right.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:03:35):**  So Harriet Mella is one of the world's leading soil scientists known for her work uncovering  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:03:39):**  the unexplained phenomena of plant growth and development.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:03:43):**  Now there is a lot of exciting information emerging all the time from this relatively  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:03:49):**  new study of soil and the soil food web.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:03:53):**  And as a researcher on the cutting edge of soil science, Harriet Mella will shed some  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:03:56):**  light on the discoveries that are changing our understanding of the world beneath our  
**[0:04:01-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:04:01):**  feet.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:04:02):**  How's that to get us started?  
**[0:04:05-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:04:05):**  So look, I am going to...  
**[0:04:06-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:04:06):**  It's a bit of pressure on me, you know.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:04:08):**  So I am going to resist the urge to start by asking if you will just tell me everything  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:04:14):**  you know, because we do not have time for that as much as I would love to.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:04:18):**  But how about this?  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:04:20):**  So there have been some really huge leaps in the understanding of soil ecology in recent  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:04:25):**  years.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:04:27):**  And these have branched out into a lot of different disciplines, everything from explorations  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:04:32):**  of soil EH levels, the fourth phase of water, synergistic relationships between plants and  
**[0:04:38-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:04:38):**  the soil food web, things like paramagnetism, epigenetics, and all of this can be really  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:04:44):**  overwhelming, especially for people trying to apply it on their own land.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:04:49):**  So what, in your opinion, are the really crucial concepts to grasp and to apply in order to  
**[0:04:56-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:04:56):**  restore healthy function to soil ecology?  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:04:59):**  I realize that this is somewhat reductionist and making it simplified, but let's start  
**[0:05:05-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:05:05):**  there.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:05:06):**  Now I'm thinking of a real smart answer, you know.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:05:08):**  Don't worry, there's no pressure here.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:05:11):**  This is a discussion.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:05:13):**  The thing is, there is so many approaches.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:05:18):**  When I just think of your discussion you had the other day, you can go into the system  
**[0:05:23-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:05:23):**  just by trust and just do it.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:05:26):**  And then you can go into the system analyzing, thinking, planning, and going in, and then  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:05:33):**  you do it and you find out it works all different than you first envisioned.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:05:39):**  So I'm a bit wary about saying this is the method, but the thing to keep in mind, my  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:05:48):**  opinion, is to always be a bit humble and to know that out there, there are organisms  
**[0:05:54-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:05:54):**  that are specialists.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:05:56):**  We are not.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:05:58):**  And all the science that we have in our hands now, you know, in German we say it's in child's  
**[0:06:04-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:06:04):**  shoes.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:06:05):**  We're just beginning to understand, still beginning to understand after all this work.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:06:11):**  So maybe the approach, as John has put it, it's better just to let biology do its work  
**[0:06:24-0:06:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:06:24):**  properly and not to inhibit it.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:06:27):**  That's maybe more that we've got to learn than how to apply all these things.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:06:33):**  So I think the most important thing about soil that we have to accept instead of chemistry  
**[0:06:46-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:06:46):**  and all these things is structure.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:06:49):**  So if we manage to get a proper structure in the soil and we have a good gas exchange  
**[0:06:55-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:06:55):**  going and we have microbiology in there, many, many things will take care of itself.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:07:03):**  And I was really, really surprised that many, many questions of all these different things  
**[0:07:09-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:07:09):**  really narrow down.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:07:11):**  If we've got the crumb, you know, the crumb, then all of a sudden things start to manage  
**[0:07:21-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:07:21):**  themselves because all these things that you've mentioned before, you know, PAH and EAH and  
**[0:07:28-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:07:28):**  all these things, you know, we have all kinds of gradients in the soil in these crumbs.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:07:34):**  So you have all kinds of niches for the microbes there and they settle where they fit best  
**[0:07:44-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:07:44):**  and they begin to form a centrophy, you know, that they share metabolic pathways.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:07:51):**  They need a thousand generations.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:07:52):**  So this is something that may be interesting for many people because we always think we  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:07:57):**  do something to the soil or we put the microbes there and then it's tuned.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:08:03):**  And to keep in mind, you know, these fellows, they divide pretty slowly once a day, most  
**[0:08:09-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:08:09):**  of them, some even more slower.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:08:12):**  So something you do now or some species you introduce now, it will take roughly three  
**[0:08:17-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:08:17):**  years until it has formed centrophy, like shared metabolic pathways where one species  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:08:25):**  can do one thing and the other species can do another thing.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:08:29):**  And so they play ping pong with all these metabolites, three years.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:08:36):**  And if you have a proper structure where all these microbes can settle in, magic things  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:08:41):**  can happen, but it takes time.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:08:45):**  So basically what we are at is the quest for the crumb.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:08:51):**  That's a really good way to put it.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:08:53):**  And so let's approach this perhaps from a different angle now because you've been witness  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:08:57):**  to some really amazing things in plant health and development as you've done experiments  
**[0:09:02-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:09:02):**  and seen examples of truly healthy soil.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:09:06):**  So what is possible for plant and ecological health when soil ecology is really functioning  
**[0:09:12-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:09:12):**  optimally?  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:09:13):**  I think a lot of people don't have reference to this and don't know what can occur when  
**[0:09:18-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:09:18):**  these things are really dialed in.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:09:21):**  I don't see, honestly, I don't see any limits anymore.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:09:25):**  You know, I've used to think, I have seen scientific papers, for example, about pumpkins.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:09:32):**  First there is male flush and this male flush has 15 flowers and then comes the female flush.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:09:38):**  And then again, this is all the wrong question.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:09:43):**  I have seen pumpkins now with better seed mixes that are more alive and with basalt  
**[0:09:51-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:09:51):**  split in them.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:09:52):**  I have seen pumpkins come out and they have the main shoot.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:09:55):**  They have the first, the cotyledos, and then they get side shoots.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:10:01):**  And every one of the three tips had a female flower as first flower on them.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:10:09):**  So you have triple crown flower, you know, just cotyledos and triple crown flower.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:10:15):**  My conditions, they're not so wonderful that these fellows could realize that potential.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:10:21):**  But, you know, just thinking that a plant that size, if the soil is well enough, could  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:10:27):**  make three pumpkins, you know, immediately after getting out and then keeping on like  
**[0:10:32-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:10:32):**  this branching.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:10:34):**  And I have seen beans, for example, you know, the one truss usually it's like six or eight.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:10:41):**  And then you see all of a sudden you have 16 beans or you have 25 double trusses of  
**[0:10:47-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:10:47):**  cherry tomatoes.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:10:49):**  You know, there is, now I'm at a point where I say there is no limit to crop potential.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:10:55):**  No, absolutely not.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:10:57):**  And the limit is the soil and the light, what the plant get and the water.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:11:03):**  Sure.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:11:04):**  Well, then from the soil aspect, a lot of people come back with, well, it's not possible  
**[0:11:10-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:11:10):**  in my soils.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:11:11):**  And I'm wondering, is this really possible across the spectrum or do climate factors  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:11:17):**  and especially baseline mineral compositions really determine the upper limits of what  
**[0:11:23-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:11:23):**  can happen in healthy soils?  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:11:26):**  That's a real, real touchy topic, a real touchy topic.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:11:32):**  And for example, John has become very cautious.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:11:34):**  You know, he used to say everything is possible.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:11:38):**  Then he said for a while, well, minerals that are in the mineral profile are there and the  
**[0:11:45-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:11:45):**  others are not.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:11:47):**  And the problem is that once you touch the topic of cold fusion or these low energy nuclear,  
**[0:11:57-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:11:57):**  Lenner, that's the name that they have given that, you know, many people just explode because  
**[0:12:06-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:12:06):**  we have these high energy institutions where these things are supposed to be researched.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:12:13):**  And it is out of bounds that this type of thing could ever happen in the soil.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:12:19):**  So the thing is that there is research out there from Korea and from Japan that have  
**[0:12:26-0:12:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:12:26):**  been looking at these transmutations of elements.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:12:32):**  And if, if I'm not saying that this happens because I have not been sitting in this experiment  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:12:40):**  and seeing these things, I just can see what is in literature around.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:12:44):**  If these things happen, they happen only if we have a diversity of microbes around and  
**[0:12:50-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:12:50):**  if these microbes are well fed and then they have reported with methods that seem to be  
**[0:12:59-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:12:59):**  really up to date, but I cannot say anything to the background or if this had been thoroughly  
**[0:13:05-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:13:05):**  done or not.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:13:07):**  And then even mineral profiles could change.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:13:12):**  So again, in theory, maybe no limit.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:13:18):**  But of course, probably it's faster if the soil is on ground zero and nothing is working  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:13:24):**  and we do not have biology, we do not have structure, we do not have anything.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:13:28):**  It's probably smarter to import basalt rock dust and other things and microbiology to  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:13:34):**  get started instead of saying, oh, I'm waiting for the linear wave to go through my soil  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:13:38):**  and change everything.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:13:42):**  So I don't say no.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:13:45):**  I don't say no.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:13:48):**  But I cannot say yes, this is so and expose myself as omniscient because I'm not, I'm  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:13:54):**  simply, I have not seen these experience personal.  
**[0:13:57-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:13:57):**  Sorry.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:13:58):**  No, that's, that's perfectly okay.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:14:00):**  I really like that attitude that all of these things are possible, but there is an essential  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:14:05):**  part of understanding the context that you're working with and the tools that are available  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:14:11):**  and some of the exterior factors that that influence all of this.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:14:16):**  I mean, it gets extremely detailed, but there's also a real importance from some of the fringe  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:14:22):**  scientists in this area, people who are advancing things that have long been controversial,  
**[0:14:27-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:14:27):**  but are starting to show some real promise.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:14:30):**  And maybe I won't go into any one of those individually, but I'm interested to hear from  
**[0:14:35-0:14:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:14:35):**  you where some of the promise is in these disciplines that have not normally been accepted  
**[0:14:43-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:14:43):**  by the normal scientific community and are deserving of some more attention.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:14:49):**  Okay.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:14:52):**  Now look, sound, for example, is one thing.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:14:58):**  There is many devices researched now in mainly Asian countries.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:15:04):**  I mean, of course, you know, there is a division running across the world.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:15:09):**  You have these highly industrialized Western countries where we're just looking at what  
**[0:15:14-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:15:14):**  can we do with chemistry and more pesticides and the perfect fertilizer mixture.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:15:21):**  So this mainly hydroponic view of the soil, what can we pour on, you know, to make the  
**[0:15:28-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:15:28):**  plant grow.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:15:29):**  And then you have the countries where people still starve and where there is not the resources  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:15:36):**  and neither the money around to buy all these things.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:15:40):**  So of course, in these countries, much research has been run to look at other methods that  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:15:47):**  possibly or potentially could raise the yields.  
**[0:15:51-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:15:51):**  So for example, sound has been researched in Chinese countries a lot or also these,  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:16:01):**  the paramagnetism research, it's really interesting.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:16:05):**  I cannot find happening much except in John's halo.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:16:13):**  And there is this antenna based research around Christophe Loh in France, you know, who has  
**[0:16:24-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:16:24):**  done research on that.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:16:25):**  But I do not see these streams really researched in strict university science.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:16:32):**  For example, paramagnetism, you do not find a lot.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:16:35):**  You find magnetism, magnetism in water.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:16:40):**  There is also devices available by now that magnetize the water where they say, oh, the  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:16:45):**  water use efficiency goes up, you know, you need less water, plants are healthy and all  
**[0:16:50-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:16:50):**  these things or magnetic treatments of seeds and all these things, you know, they're done.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:16:59):**  But they are done on and off.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:17:01):**  And very often the studies are not comparable.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:17:05):**  That's a problem.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:17:07):**  But what I see is, for example, sound or paramagnetism, they would have a great potential to help.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:17:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:17:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:17:14):**  And I would love to go into more of that as well.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:17:16):**  But I think I'll leave that to the listeners to explore.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:17:20):**  I'm curious now to understand, you know, we talk a lot about testing our soil and gathering  
**[0:17:25-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:17:25):**  results in order to inform protocols and management practices to improve the overall health.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:17:32):**  But there are a lot of things that first of all, people say that don't really show up  
**[0:17:36-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:17:36):**  reliably in most common tests.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:17:38):**  And there are new tests that come out quite often that promise to show certain metrics  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:17:42):**  above others and give a more overall understanding of what is happening under our feet.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:17:47):**  Can you talk about some of the tests that you rely on to give a realistic idea of different  
**[0:17:54-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:17:54):**  parameters that are worth measuring when we're quantifying holistic health of the soil ecosystem?  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:18:03):**  I personally hear, as I do not have a large acreage, I have had to learn to interpret  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:18:09):**  visual cues that the plants give.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:18:13):**  And to read weeds and to read illnesses and pests.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:18:17):**  I have had to do that because it's impossible with the diversity of varieties I have and  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:18:23):**  the diversity of little crops to run plant sap analysis.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:18:27):**  Simply not possible.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:18:29):**  So as I'm a trained observer, this is the way I have chosen.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:18:40):**  And the most promising soil test as a soil test that gives you information about what  
**[0:18:48-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:18:48):**  the soil can, you know, what you are in with your crop will be the Haney test that has  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:18:54):**  recently appeared on the market.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:18:57):**  So it basically is, there is an effect that's called Birch effect.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:19:05):**  So if you dry out the soil completely and you rewet it, it will give off a surge of  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:19:11):**  nutrients and carbon dioxide.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:19:16):**  And the Haney test basically pursues this idea.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:19:20):**  So it's a bit smaller than what the plant can achieve because the plants exudate will  
**[0:19:27-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:19:27):**  even enhance this level probably a bit above the Haney test if the plant really can communicate  
**[0:19:34-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:19:34):**  with the soil microbial community.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:19:36):**  But that seems to be the test that really captures the available fraction, the plant  
**[0:19:42-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:19:42):**  available fraction.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:19:45):**  And of course, do not look at soil, look in the plant, plant sap analysis.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:19:51):**  And I really, really treasure the way that John has begun to interpret.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:19:59):**  So when you see nutrients shifting from old growth into new growth, then you know that  
**[0:20:06-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:20:06):**  the plant is short on this nutrient.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:20:09):**  This special variety is short on this nutrient.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:20:12):**  So you do not have a standard set that says, okay, this apple variety needs always such  
**[0:20:17-0:20:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:20:17):**  and such, but you really can individually look at a plant and its state and its climate  
**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:20:23):**  and this special location and adapt the protocols.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:20:29):**  I really like that message because it's been shown time and time again, because soil is  
**[0:20:34-0:20:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:20:34):**  a living in a dynamic ecosystem rather than a single thing, certainly not dead.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:20:41):**  Interventions need to be taken at key times, especially in plant development, because they  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:20:45):**  are not the same throughout the growing season.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:20:47):**  And like you said, this is expressed very often in the plants itself, not needing to  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:20:51):**  go necessarily into the soil directly, but observing.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:20:55):**  And you mentioned because you are a trained observer, a lot of these deficiencies or necessary  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:21:01):**  interventions can be deduced by paying close attention to the plants and their development.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:21:07):**  Can you go into a little more detail about some of the indicators that perhaps a less  
**[0:21:11-0:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:21:11):**  trained observer can learn to observe and take valuable information from at the point  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:21:18):**  in time when it's important to intervene or make some sort of amendment?  
**[0:21:23-0:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:21:23):**  Well, look, I have a friend that is a cow, a dairy farmer, and he said, when I go into  
**[0:21:30-0:21:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:21:30):**  the stable, I just need to look at the cows ears.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:21:35):**  And if they are droopy, I know that something's wrong.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:21:39):**  And basically the first signal that a plant gives you is that it's not feeding properly,  
**[0:21:45-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:21:45):**  that it's not interested in sunlight is the way it puts leaves in the angle to the sunlight.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:21:55):**  A plant that has a healthy microbiome around its roots that is in good nutritional status,  
**[0:22:03-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:22:03):**  it will track the sun.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:22:06):**  It will prick the ears up.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:22:08):**  You will see it and it will really spread out the angle between the leaves optimally  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:22:13):**  to catch sunlight.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:22:17):**  So when you see this, really that optimal solar panel arrangement, then you know that  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:22:24):**  basically things are running smoothly.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:22:29):**  Once you see your plant avoiding sunlight, you know, you can really see that the plant  
**[0:22:34-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:22:34):**  shifts the leaf out of the sunlight.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:22:37):**  It droops them or whatever, you know, any strange gesture, you should get alerted.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:22:44):**  Something is not okay.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:22:48):**  And the other thing is real healthy leaf.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:22:51):**  When you see it, it's kind of glowing from the inside.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:22:55):**  You know, it's completely translucent and it's, you know, it is as if a light was switched  
**[0:23:02-0:23:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:23:02):**  in it.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:23:03):**  It's like a glow.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:23:05):**  And anything where you see that is, you know, it's turbid or, you know, botanists say glaup,  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:23:13):**  you know, when the surface is like opaque, you know, it's not really shiny.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:23:18):**  And you know, something's going wrong there.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:23:22):**  This happens, for example, when the chloroplasts are shifted from their positions, when they  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:23:25):**  begin to run with the cytoplasm, when they begin to be degraded, you know, all these  
**[0:23:30-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:23:30):**  changes in inner structure, they reflect just in the way the leaf shines in the sunlight.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:23:40):**  And these are the first signals and they come day before any other trouble shines up.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:23:48):**  And then of course, you see the morphology of the new growth.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:23:52):**  If it is, I mean, this is, for example, there's an excellent webinar from John, The Hidden  
**[0:23:58-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:23:58):**  Hunger, excellent, you know, there's many cues in terms of different minerals.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:24:04):**  But the more boring leaf is in terms of evenness of color, veins, the same green as anything  
**[0:24:14-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:24:14):**  else.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:24:15):**  And once you begin to see this wax layer, you know, you're on the safe side.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:24:21):**  And an important thing is leaf thickness.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:24:24):**  That's the first indicator for me, you know, these round leaves and thick leaves when when  
**[0:24:29-0:24:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:24:29):**  seedlings emerge.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:24:31):**  That's the first test I make just are they thick or are they thin?  
**[0:24:35-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:24:35):**  Are they spread out?  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:24:36):**  And then I already know, okay, here's something I really have to pimp, you know, I have to  
**[0:24:41-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:24:41):**  take special care of, or where I say, these, I can leave them alone, they will do whatever,  
**[0:24:49-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:24:49):**  you know.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:24:51):**  And the other thing that is just from passing by that you immediately notice, if a leaf  
**[0:24:57-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:24:57):**  has this fractal structure, you know, where leaf edges are serrated, or wherever, the  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:25:04):**  more pronounced these things is, the more healthy the plant is.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:25:09):**  So rounded leaves, spread out leaves, fractal structures, you know, for example, in lettuces,  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:25:15):**  very often you see that is serrated ages or, you know, and when they get trichomes.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:25:20):**  And the smell, you know, a plant, when I go into the greenhouse, I just smell immediately  
**[0:25:28-0:25:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:25:28):**  if there is something going wrong or not.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:25:30):**  And every person can that subconsciously, you know, these stories, going into a healthy  
**[0:25:36-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:25:36):**  forest, heartbeat slows down.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:25:38):**  So immediately when you go there, you know, by instinct, are my plants happy or aren't  
**[0:25:45-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:25:45):**  they?  
**[0:25:46-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:25:46):**  The problem is to get conscious of this, it is, I sometimes tell the story in when lettuces,  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:25:54):**  I grow them for seed very often.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:25:56):**  So I knew two days or three days before they were going to bolt, I knew that they would.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:26:02):**  And I thought, this kind of mystic, you know.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:26:06):**  And then I realized what I really was perceiving that the leaf wax layer was going away and  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:26:13):**  the leaves began to look turbid, which is actually the case when the plant has not enough  
**[0:26:19-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:26:19):**  nutrients to support the bloom and has to degrade the photosynthetic apparatus for it.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:26:26):**  And as my ground is not perfect, this was the moment where the lettuces would do that.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:26:33):**  So that was all the magic.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:26:37):**  And these are some fascinating observations.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:26:39):**  And you explained that really well.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:26:40):**  I really made me think that back to some observations I've made in my own garden and on farms that  
**[0:26:45-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:26:45):**  I visited.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:26:47):**  And it seems pretty clear that you can train yourself to notice these.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:26:51):**  But like you said, it's a matter of practice.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:26:53):**  It probably isn't going to come in the first couple of weeks, months or years, but you  
**[0:26:57-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:26:57):**  become attuned to these and the more subtle energies that are transmitted by other beings,  
**[0:27:03-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:27:03):**  which we're often not brought up in being taught to observe.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:27:09):**  And along those lines, I'm wondering what you can say about the training in subtle energies.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:27:16):**  The fact that you can actually be trained in that in places like the US and Australia.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:27:20):**  This is a formal study now and how that fits in with a broader awareness of the holistic  
**[0:27:27-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:27:27):**  health of a farm ecology or a garden ecology.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:27:36):**  I'm not really sure what subtle energies are taught currently in these schools.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:27:43):**  What I can say is that you can train yourself to perceive, for example, the energy lines  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:27:55):**  in fields, for example, you know, sharp edged rocks, for example.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:28:01):**  It's like it's nearly like a beam of energy that's coming off them, of many of them, not  
**[0:28:06-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:28:06):**  all.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:28:07):**  Or, for example, if there is a pipeline running through, I once had a field that was really  
**[0:28:10-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:28:10):**  funny, you know, this was like, what is going on here?  
**[0:28:14-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:28:14):**  You know, and then when we were up, you saw that just one straight line, the plants were  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:28:20):**  greener and higher and say, what is in the ground there?  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:28:23):**  And there was a gas pipeline running.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:28:27):**  And the other thing is that, you know, it becomes a bit fashionable now to say there  
**[0:28:34-0:28:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:28:34):**  is no inside and outside and I can only hit in the same direction.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:28:41):**  I have very often found plans to really react to the subconscious impulse you have.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:28:49):**  So for example, you try to make it perfect.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:28:53):**  You want the perfect crop, the perfect soil, the perfect microbiome.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:28:56):**  You give yourself a lot of pressure, you practice very hard and you're so fed up.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:29:03):**  You have no time, you're rushing around, it's spring and you're so fed up and the climate  
**[0:29:08-0:29:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:29:08):**  is not working at all.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:29:09):**  And the whole day you're carrying boxes with transplants in and out.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:29:15):**  And this usually is the moment where things stop functioning, where seeds that always  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:29:22):**  germinate will not germinate, where seeds, white transplants that always catch will not  
**[0:29:27-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:29:27):**  catch on anymore, you know, and where something, you know, things go out of order.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:29:36):**  And this is something I really had to learn to take great care of that.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:29:40):**  Not what I think consciously is the impulse that works, but what's running beneath, what's  
**[0:29:46-0:29:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:29:46):**  hitting the emotional layer.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:29:49):**  And this is why I very often say, do the best you can in a relaxed and trusting way.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:29:58):**  Because otherwise, you know, it will screw up.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:30:02):**  It's scientifically perfect, but you still find a way to screw up.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:30:08):**  And I have done it a hundred times, believe me.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:30:11):**  I think that's really good advice that can be applied to so many other things beyond  
**[0:30:16-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:30:16):**  farming and gardening as well.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:30:17):**  And it's good to kind of keep in mind that when you get into that mentality or that energy  
**[0:30:22-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:30:22):**  level, not only are you more accident prone, but it's received by other life forms around  
**[0:30:27-0:30:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:30:27):**  you and it can be spread.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/harriet-mella-demystifies-cutting-edge-soil-science-for-ideal-plant-health/#t=0:30:29):**  Now, look, Harriet, I have so many more questions that I would love to just take over this entire

**[0:03:44-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-definitive-guide-to-no-till-organic-farming-part-2-with-andrew-mefferd-author-of-the-organic-no-till-farming-revolution-105/#t=0:03:44):**  Tell me a little bit about the technique, the benefits, and which type of farm it might

**[0:04:02-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-definitive-guide-to-no-till-organic-farming-part-2-with-andrew-mefferd-author-of-the-organic-no-till-farming-revolution-105/#t=0:04:02):**  how do I tie all these systems together?  
**[0:04:05-0:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-definitive-guide-to-no-till-organic-farming-part-2-with-andrew-mefferd-author-of-the-organic-no-till-farming-revolution-105/#t=0:04:05):**  What do they all have in common?  
**[0:04:07-0:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-definitive-guide-to-no-till-organic-farming-part-2-with-andrew-mefferd-author-of-the-organic-no-till-farming-revolution-105/#t=0:04:07):**  And so really the one thing that all these systems have in common is that they use some  
**[0:04:14-0:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-definitive-guide-to-no-till-organic-farming-part-2-with-andrew-mefferd-author-of-the-organic-no-till-farming-revolution-105/#t=0:04:14):**  type of a mulch to do the job and replace the action of tillage.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-definitive-guide-to-no-till-organic-farming-part-2-with-andrew-mefferd-author-of-the-organic-no-till-farming-revolution-105/#t=0:04:21):**  So let's start with the first one then.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-definitive-guide-to-no-till-organic-farming-part-2-with-andrew-mefferd-author-of-the-organic-no-till-farming-revolution-105/#t=0:04:27):**  Let's start talking about mulch grown in place.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-definitive-guide-to-no-till-organic-farming-part-2-with-andrew-mefferd-author-of-the-organic-no-till-farming-revolution-105/#t=0:04:31):**  So I'll try to break these down really to their most basic elements, because I could  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-definitive-guide-to-no-till-organic-farming-part-2-with-andrew-mefferd-author-of-the-organic-no-till-farming-revolution-105/#t=0:04:40):**  talk all day long about this stuff and I love to, but I also think I'm just going to break  
**[0:04:45-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-definitive-guide-to-no-till-organic-farming-part-2-with-andrew-mefferd-author-of-the-organic-no-till-farming-revolution-105/#t=0:04:45):**  them down so people can kind of figure out what each system is and they can decide if  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-definitive-guide-to-no-till-organic-farming-part-2-with-andrew-mefferd-author-of-the-organic-no-till-farming-revolution-105/#t=0:04:51):**  one really appeals to them, then they could either get the book and go really in-depth.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-definitive-guide-to-no-till-organic-farming-part-2-with-andrew-mefferd-author-of-the-organic-no-till-farming-revolution-105/#t=0:04:56):**  So the first no-till system that I learned is I call mulch grown in place.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-definitive-guide-to-no-till-organic-farming-part-2-with-andrew-mefferd-author-of-the-organic-no-till-farming-revolution-105/#t=0:05:07):**  Some people call it the roller crimper method.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-definitive-guide-to-no-till-organic-farming-part-2-with-andrew-mefferd-author-of-the-organic-no-till-farming-revolution-105/#t=0:05:11):**  The idea is that for mulch grown in place, it's really a pretty clever idea.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-definitive-guide-to-no-till-organic-farming-part-2-with-andrew-mefferd-author-of-the-organic-no-till-farming-revolution-105/#t=0:05:20):**  What they do is they will grow a really dense cover crop.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-definitive-guide-to-no-till-organic-farming-part-2-with-andrew-mefferd-author-of-the-organic-no-till-farming-revolution-105/#t=0:05:24):**  So a lot of people use either rye or a combination of rye and vetch.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-the-definitive-guide-to-no-till-organic-farming-part-2-with-andrew-mefferd-author-of-the-organic-no-till-farming-revolution-105/#t=0:05:29):**  So anybody who's grown rye and vetch, particularly in a climate where you either get a lot of

**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:01:45):**  Here we are on the last episode of season 1 and I have a really valuable interview for  
**[0:01:50-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:01:50):**  all of you to wrap up the season.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:01:52):**  Over the last year we've talked so much about the regeneration of landscapes and ecosystems  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:01:56):**  through permaculture as well as natural building techniques and materials, but to end on a  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:02:01):**  bit of a different note, I spoke with Breanne Gibson, founder of Circular Nutrition, to  
**[0:02:06-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:02:06):**  talk about some unexpected ways to apply holistic design and living practices to our own lives.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:02:12):**  Breanne is a leading holistic nutritionist, live food expert, and permaculture practitioner  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:02:17):**  who talks to us about cultivating a regenerative ecosystem within ourselves through healthy  
**[0:02:22-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:02:22):**  eating and lifestyle choices.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:02:24):**  She dives deep into the controversial topics of GMO foods, fad diets, and digestive issue  
**[0:02:30-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:02:30):**  treatment.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:02:31):**  Breanne even gives me a mini consultation in which we go over my own history of digestive  
**[0:02:35-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:02:35):**  illness and discuss how antibiotics, parasites, and diet can contribute to gut dysbiosis and  
**[0:02:42-0:02:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:02:42):**  some of the ways to get back to optimum health.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:02:44):**  I can only imagine how many comments and discussions these topics will spark just for how personal  
**[0:02:50-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:02:50):**  everyone's opinions about health and nutrition are these days.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:02:53):**  The truth is, I've become really fascinated by all the ways that permaculture design and  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:02:57):**  regenerative project management can be applied to other areas of life besides the more commonly  
**[0:03:02-0:03:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:03:02):**  associated land-based renewal projects.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:03:05):**  You can look forward to hearing a lot more about these topics when Season 2 of The Abundant  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:03:09):**  Edge begins on February 2nd of 2018.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:03:13):**  But don't forget to keep listening to our little in-between episodes where I'll give  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:03:17):**  some early enrollment information for our upcoming Regenerative Homesteading Apprenticeship,  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:03:21):**  the 2018 Workshop Schedule, and information on how to get your questions answered by our  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:03:26):**  panel of experts, all coming up in Season 2, so stick around after the interview to  
**[0:03:30-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:03:30):**  hear more about that.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:03:32):**  This is another information-dense interview, so you might want to grab your notebooks for  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:03:36):**  this one and I'll turn things over to Breanne Gibson.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:03:39):**  Hey Breanne, thank you so much for taking time today.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:03:41):**  How are you doing there in Colombia?  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:03:44):**  I'm doing really awesome, thank you.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:03:47):**  So I know we've got a lot to cover in this interview, so how about we just jump into  
**[0:03:51-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:03:51):**  some of the questions and we can go from there.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:03:53):**  Sure, yeah, sounds great.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:03:54):**  Alright, so let's get started by talking a little bit about your background.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:03:59):**  Tell me a little bit about how you got into health and nutrition, and how you've learned  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:04:03):**  to apply that to the environment around for your clients and for yourself.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:04:08):**  Sure.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:04:09):**  Well, I started off actually in the military for 10 years working as a bioscience officer,  
**[0:04:16-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:04:16):**  so what my work pertained was I was really writing environmental human health risk assessments  
**[0:04:22-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:04:22):**  for countries globally, really studying and analyzing samples of soil, water, air, infectious  
**[0:04:30-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:04:30):**  diseases, and various environmental factors and what the pose, you know, the damage that  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:04:38):**  those things had could potentially have on the risk to the humans that were exposed to  
**[0:04:42-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:04:42):**  them.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:04:44):**  So that was kind of my first slide into the environmental side of things.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:04:51):**  I also did some toxicology work when I was completing my master's in environmental science,  
**[0:04:56-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:04:56):**  so I had a huge passion for environmental science, and it was actually during that time  
**[0:05:02-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:05:02):**  when I had started my master's that I really became aware of how us as a human species  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:05:10):**  were impacting the state of our environment.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:05:14):**  And so outside work hours I went on this massive research and trying to figure everything out  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:05:19):**  of like, okay, well, if we've damaged our environment so much, how is that impacting  
**[0:05:24-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:05:24):**  our health?  
**[0:05:27-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:05:27):**  What does that mean for our food?  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:05:29):**  And I went on this massive research trying to figure it all out, so that led me into  
**[0:05:34-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:05:34):**  studying holistic nutrition, also studying some homeopathy, doing some training in yoga,  
**[0:05:42-0:05:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:05:42):**  and went really deep into meditation.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:05:44):**  So it was kind of a whole combination when I became really aware of just the impact and  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:05:51):**  the state of our environment and what could we do, you know, for our own health but also  
**[0:05:57-0:06:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:05:57):**  for the environment to thrive here essentially longer.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:06:00):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:06:01):**  You even studied some of those things here in Guatemala, in Lake Atitlan, didn't you?  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:06:06):**  Yeah, actually Guatemala was my first stop when I took that big jump into the unknown  
**[0:06:12-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:06:12):**  and let go of my career as an officer, and you know, because I really, during that time  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:06:21):**  I didn't feel I was in the right spot for where I was to serve.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:06:26):**  So it was like something inside of me was just like, this is not where I want to be,  
**[0:06:31-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:06:31):**  this is not allowing me to reach my full potential and live my true passion.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:06:34):**  And so when I took that step away, took off the uniform, Guatemala was actually my first  
**[0:06:40-0:06:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:06:40):**  stop when I started my, I guess, journey into really getting out there, exploring permaculture,  
**[0:06:49-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:06:49):**  watching nature, connecting with people and the culture and the land, and it was right  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:06:56):**  in San Marcos there that I was up at the yoga course actually.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:07:01):**  When they first started I was, I think, one of their first interns there in San Marcos.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:07:07):**  Yeah, and through there you got to know Jeremy Fellows, one of the partners here at Abundant  
**[0:07:11-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:07:11):**  Edge, right?  
**[0:07:12-0:07:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:07:12):**  Yes, he was amazing.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:07:13):**  He was my first permaculture teacher.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:07:16):**  Excellent.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:07:17):**  He's actually going to be back here in just a couple days now, so we're looking forward  
**[0:07:20-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:07:20):**  to having him back here too.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:07:21):**  Yeah, I know, he was great.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:07:23):**  We had our workshop before our day's work and I learned a lot from Jeremy, so super,  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:07:28):**  super grateful for that time there.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:07:31):**  That's great.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:07:32):**  So now let's talk a little bit about how you help clients to achieve better health in a  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:07:37):**  way that includes the health of their local environment as well.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:07:42):**  Sure.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:07:44):**  So essentially one of my big things when working with clients is really getting back to nature.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:07:50):**  So not only your outer nature but also your inner nature.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:07:55):**  So talking about our inner ecology, our inner body, right down to our gut.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:08:02):**  So educating and working with my clients in a team type setting of really empowering them  
**[0:08:09-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:08:09):**  to get reconnected, go in within themselves but also outside themselves and realize that  
**[0:08:16-0:08:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:08:16):**  your external environment has massive, massive impact on your health and what can you do  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:08:23):**  to optimize your health and performance in whatever setting you are in.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:08:28):**  And a lot of that comes down to getting reconnected to the natural world around you, whether that's  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:08:33):**  the food, whether that's where the food is being grown, getting out into the forest,  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:08:39):**  touching the earth, getting dirty, you know, all these things to really just get more integrated  
**[0:08:44-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:08:44):**  to what's real.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:08:47):**  So that's a big part of how I work with my clients.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:08:50):**  Sure.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:08:51):**  So let's go now.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:08:52):**  I know you mentioned you'd studied some toxicology in the past.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:08:55):**  Can you talk a little about how the exterior environment affects one's health and how can  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:09:00):**  someone improve their own physical condition by repairing their interactions with the ecology  
**[0:09:05-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:09:05):**  around them?  
**[0:09:06-0:09:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:09:06):**  Okay.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:09:07):**  So do you mean in terms of what's happening out there in the environment that are affecting  
**[0:09:11-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:09:11):**  people's health or really what can that individual do no matter what environment that they find  
**[0:09:18-0:09:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:09:18):**  themselves in?  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:09:19):**  Well, let's start with how the outside world can be affecting your health and then maybe  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:09:24):**  on a case-by-case basis we can touch on a few of the things that people can do.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:09:28):**  Because obviously this is a very broad range, right?  
**[0:09:30-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:09:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:09:31):**  So I mean the external world, there's so much happening out there right now when we talk  
**[0:09:36-0:09:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:09:36):**  about our environment and depending on where you may live, there's different things happening  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:09:43):**  in different areas.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:09:44):**  But as a whole there's a lot happening.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:09:46):**  One of the key things that I'm super passionate about is really the soil.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:09:53):**  Most conventional agriculture has – we've lost our soil and a lot of what our food is  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:09:59):**  growing in is essentially dirt.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:10:01):**  It's dead.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:10:02):**  It doesn't have the nutrients in it.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:10:03):**  It doesn't have the live microorganisms in it.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:10:06):**  And therefore a lot of the food that people are eating do not have those nutrients either.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:10:11):**  And like us, we need 70 different types of vitamin and minerals.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:10:16):**  Plants need the same amount.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:10:18):**  And so when the plants aren't actually being able to be fueled that from the soil that  
**[0:10:24-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:10:24):**  they're growing in, we're not getting that either from the food that we're eating.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:10:27):**  So a big thing when I work with people is really sharing like where is your food coming  
**[0:10:33-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:10:33):**  from going back to source.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:10:36):**  Source is so critical in terms of can you connect with your local farmers.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:10:41):**  Is there a farm nearby?  
**[0:10:42-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:10:42):**  Is there a farmer's market?  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:10:44):**  How can you connect to the source of where your food is coming from and really be putting  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:10:48):**  your money towards what you want to support?  
**[0:10:54-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:10:54):**  I think this is like a really big thing that we as humans, we need to be doing more and  
**[0:11:01-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:11:01):**  more especially in the urban environments.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:11:03):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:11:04):**  I completely agree with that.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:11:06):**  Now I also know that you feel passionately about GMO foods and removing them specifically  
**[0:11:11-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:11:11):**  from our diets.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:11:12):**  What are some of the harms that these genetically altered food products present?  
**[0:11:17-0:11:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:11:17):**  Yes.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:11:18):**  I realize it's a bit of a controversial issue but go ahead.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:11:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:11:25):**  I mean there's a lot of myths out there about genetically modified organisms because of  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:11:31):**  the big corporate agriculture companies, corporations out there that are really instilling a lot  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:11:37):**  of these myths and people getting – it's kind of – well I believe it's fear-based  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:11:43):**  driven because whoever controls the food controls the people.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:11:48):**  So genetically modified foods in the way in which they're moving, I mean they are growing  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:11:53):**  and they're in so many foods out there on the market especially processed foods.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:11:58):**  So that's another reason I always suggest like move away from processed foods because  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:12:03):**  most processed foods are going to have these genetically modified foods in them.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:12:07):**  Some of the top genetically modified foods are corn, soy, canola, so a lot of canola  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:12:12):**  oil and sugar beet which is the sugar that is used in a lot of processed foods.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:12:18):**  When we talk about genetically modified foods, there has been since they've come out onto  
**[0:12:25-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:12:25):**  the market and they've been out on the market for about 20 years now is there has been no  
**[0:12:33-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:12:33):**  long-term human clinical trials.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:12:35):**  There's been no post-marketing surveillance.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:12:38):**  There's been no proper evaluation of what actually is happening to the plant and how  
**[0:12:45-0:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:12:45):**  those changes then comes into the human body.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:12:49):**  What is that doing in our gut when a gene has been altered or turned off or taken out  
**[0:12:58-0:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:12:58):**  or something else has been added to that gene from an alternate source.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:13:04):**  The other thing about genetically modified foods is governments, the approvals to get  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:13:10):**  them out there on the market, they're based on disproved or untested assumption and a  
**[0:13:15-0:13:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:13:15):**  lot of them are coming from the very corporation that developed the genetically modified food.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:13:25):**  I guess the last thing maybe to say is they're not labeled.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:13:30):**  They're not labeled but yet we know what foods they are and they are in a lot of foods.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:13:36):**  It can make it challenging but at the same time, there are so many other foods to enjoy  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:13:43):**  moving away from genetically modified foods.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:13:46):**  Essentially, simply put, there's been no precautionary principle applied to genetically  
**[0:13:52-0:14:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:13:52):**  modified foods despite many scientists out there warning about the potential health risks  
**[0:14:00-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:14:00):**  which can include allergies, toxic exposure, disease, nutritional problems.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:14:11):**  I guess that's it in a nutshell.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:14:13):**  It is a huge topic area and there is a lot of research happening now.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:14:19):**  There has been numerous animal studies that have shown significant health impacts including  
**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:14:25):**  things like tumors, organ disruption, kidneys deficiency.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:14:30):**  I guess on the environmental side, a lot of genetically modified crops, one of their statements  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:14:37):**  was they will allow us to use less pesticides but in the end, farmers are actually using  
**[0:14:42-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:14:42):**  more pesticides on these crops because they've been actually made to be pesticide resistant  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:14:48):**  so farmers can now spray that crop heavily using even more and statistics are showing  
**[0:14:54-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:14:54):**  that this is the case.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:14:56):**  Genetically modified foods also have higher levels of pesticides on them which are gut  
**[0:15:03-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:15:03):**  and our bodies are impacted by severely.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:15:10):**  Glyphosate is one of them.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:15:12):**  Certainly.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:15:13):**  Yeah, so I've heard a couple of sides to this argument and it can be very difficult for  
**[0:15:20-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:15:20):**  the lay person to wade through the different arguments and the different evidence from  
**[0:15:25-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:15:25):**  both sides but for me as a permaculture designer, the main thing that I see being attempted  
**[0:15:32-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:15:32):**  with genetically modified crops is simply to overcome bad land management practices.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:15:39):**  So the reason why they're changed to be able to be resistant to pesticides is because we  
**[0:15:45-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:15:45):**  continue to plant things in a monoculture that is extremely susceptible to pest damage  
**[0:15:52-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:15:52):**  and all of the other either nutritional or I guess security modifications that are made  
**[0:15:59-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:15:59):**  to the genetics of these organisms is all with the intention as sort of a band-aid fix  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:16:05):**  for an endemic problem with how poorly the landscape is managed under modern farming  
**[0:16:10-0:16:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:16:10):**  techniques.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:16:11):**  And so, whether you believe the research about it being damaging or whether you believe the  
**[0:16:16-0:16:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:16:16):**  rebuttals that there's not any evidence to say that it's causing disease in the body,  
**[0:16:24-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:16:24):**  either way, it's really just masking the fact that we haven't figured out a good way to  
**[0:16:31-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:16:31):**  mass produce a lot of crops in an ecologically sustainable or regenerative manner and these  
**[0:16:37-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:16:37):**  band-aid fixes are really not ever going to be sustainable in the long term.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:16:43):**  They're always going to be overcome by the lack of nutrition in the soil and the poor  
**[0:16:48-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:16:48):**  management of the ecosystem around it.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:16:50):**  That's my personal take on it.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:16:52):**  And I totally agree with you.  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:16:54):**  I mean, there has been a couple studies done side by side like on a, I think it's the Rosedale  
**[0:17:00-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:17:00):**  Institute if I'm not mistaken, but genetically modified crops compared to a fully integrated  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:17:07):**  system and that fully integrated system way outperforms the genetically modified crop.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:17:13):**  And the thing is that, I mean, nature is way more powerful than any genetically modified.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:17:20):**  Nature's just going to keep showing and creating more and more harder, harsher and harsher  
**[0:17:26-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:17:26):**  new pests, new weeds, whatever it may be until it kind of clicks that, no, just work with  
**[0:17:33-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:17:33):**  me.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:17:34):**  Sure.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:17:35):**  So, yeah, definitely.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:17:38):**  Now, the idea here is not to make this all about GMOs and I would like to sort of switch  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:17:44):**  gears here again because that could be a whole podcast in and of itself.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:17:49):**  I would also like to talk now about some of the fad diets.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:17:53):**  With so many different fad diets and health gurus sort of spouting advice and nutritional  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:17:56):**  information, I'm wondering your take on how we can figure out which health plan is right  
**[0:18:01-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:18:01):**  for ourselves and also for the planet.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:18:04):**  People seem to be so entrenched in their own decisions for health and diet and it seems  
**[0:18:09-0:18:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:18:09):**  very close to a lot of people's either personal egos or larger lifestyle choices.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:18:15):**  So this always ends up being a controversial issue but I'd like to hear your own opinion  
**[0:18:19-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:18:19):**  on that.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:18:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:18:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:18:22):**  There are so many diets out there.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:18:25):**  There's so many fad diets out there but they're just fads.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:18:29):**  They're not ones that are necessarily long lasting.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:18:32):**  They're not necessarily ones that are going to be resilient for your immune system and  
**[0:18:36-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:18:36):**  for your digestive system and really optimize your health and performance.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:18:39):**  So when we talk about like which diet is right for you, it really does come down to that.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:18:45):**  What diet is right for you?  
**[0:18:46-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:18:46):**  What does your life look like?  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:18:48):**  What's your physical activity?  
**[0:18:52-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:18:52):**  What's your mind state?  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:18:54):**  It's all the holistic approach to it, spirituality, mental, intellectually, physical and your  
**[0:19:00-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:19:00):**  lifestyle.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:19:01):**  Where are you living in the world?  
**[0:19:03-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:19:03):**  How are you spending your time?  
**[0:19:05-0:19:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:19:05):**  And so all of these components really impact what that diet is going to be for you.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:19:14):**  So I don't have a direct answer for you in terms of what diet is best but one thing I  
**[0:19:23-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:19:23):**  do know is eat food in their whole form.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:19:28):**  Eat food that are colorful.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:19:30):**  Eat food that have been grown from sustainable regenerative systems that actually have the  
**[0:19:37-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:19:37):**  nutrients in them that they are to have or at least closer to than ones coming from conventional  
**[0:19:44-0:19:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:19:44):**  agricultural systems.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:19:47):**  So those are key.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:19:49):**  I guess yeah, whole lots of plant-based foods, lots of color, lots of green foods, highly  
**[0:19:55-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:19:55):**  alkalining foods.  
**[0:19:57-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:19:57):**  All of these foods are going to be good for anybody.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:19:59):**  Marv, that's a great way to just sort of sum it up.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:20:03):**  I think people get a lot sort of off track or caught up in the details and the semantics  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:20:09):**  and even sometimes the world view that come behind a lot of these diets and it's much  
**[0:20:15-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:20:15):**  more about a larger world ethic or moral sense than it is about the nutrition that your body  
**[0:20:21-0:20:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:20:21):**  is getting.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:20:22):**  And I think yeah, that's probably one of the best ways that you could summarize a healthy  
**[0:20:26-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:20:26):**  lifestyle from a nutritional standpoint.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:20:29):**  So I appreciate you kind of boiling that down for us.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:20:31):**  Yeah, you're welcome.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:20:32):**  And I just want to comment on that.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:20:36):**  The easiest way is it's often what you take out than what you add in.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:20:39):**  That's going to impact your health and performance.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:20:43):**  Yeah, another great point.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:20:45):**  Because there's typically – right?  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:20:48):**  So yeah, it's more about taking out something that's negatively impacting you than just  
**[0:20:54-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:20:54):**  adding on more good things.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:20:55):**  But if that instigator is still there that's impacting you, you're not going to feel  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:20:59):**  better.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:21:01):**  So that's another way of looking at it as well.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:21:03):**  That's a fantastic point.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:21:05):**  And I think that applies to so many other aspects of life as well.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:21:09):**  If you remove the negative, you're often going to have better results than if you just  
**[0:21:13-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:21:13):**  try and mask it with more positive.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:21:14):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:21:15):**  Definitely.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:21:16):**  All right, so let's switch gears again once more.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:21:20):**  And this is going to kind of touch on something that's personal for me.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:21:24):**  And it's that I hear more and more often these days, especially from friends, family  
**[0:21:27-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:21:27):**  and acquaintances, that they're suffering from digestive issues.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:21:31):**  And I know that's something that you specialize a bit in.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:21:33):**  I myself have had really chronic digestive problems my entire adult life and it seems  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:21:38):**  like it's becoming a more common ailment all the time.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:21:43):**  So obviously, so many health issues originate in the gut because it's where nearly all  
**[0:21:47-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:21:47):**  of our nutrition starts.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:21:49):**  But what I'd like to know is your take on why there seems to be such a severe uptick  
**[0:21:53-0:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:21:53):**  in digestive issues.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:21:55):**  Well, I think we already hit on it a little bit with genetically modified foods and the  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:22:01):**  level of pesticide use that is being used in food crops today.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:22:05):**  So there's a lot of other things that are coming into our digestive system, not just  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:22:09):**  the food itself when we're actually taking foods in.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:22:14):**  And on the plant side of things, a lot of that comes to pesticides with one of them  
**[0:22:19-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:22:19):**  being glyphosate used heavily.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:22:22):**  The other thing is in animal products like dairy, there's growth hormones, there's  
**[0:22:27-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:22:27):**  antibiotics.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:22:28):**  And then there's also the processing of the food.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:22:31):**  So like milk, for example, a lot of processed milk has reduced size, like the fat globules  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:22:37):**  in the milk have been reduced in size due to the pasteurization process.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:22:42):**  And that allows unwanted substances to seep into the bloodstream.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:22:46):**  And when we get unwanted substances into the bloodstream, whether that's milk or other  
**[0:22:51-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:22:51):**  food components, and oftentimes their protein, is it's going to provoke inflammation throughout  
**[0:22:59-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:22:59):**  the body and lead to different health issues for the individual.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:23:04):**  So there's just so much more coming in with food than just food itself.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:23:11):**  And I think a lot of human bodies and digestive systems are speaking.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:23:16):**  They're really talking like, look, something's not on here.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:23:20):**  Something's affecting me.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:23:22):**  And people, even when they think they're eating healthy, it can get really, really frustrating  
**[0:23:26-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:23:26):**  because they may be eating the healthy foods, but really it comes back to source, like where  
**[0:23:32-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:23:32):**  did that food come from?  
**[0:23:33-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:23:33):**  Where was it grown?  
**[0:23:34-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:23:34):**  What has it been exposed to?  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:23:36):**  When was it picked from the time that you're putting it into your mouth?  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:23:40):**  And so even in transportation as well, the exposure it's had.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:23:44):**  So there's a number of different factors there that are really impacting a lot of digestive  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:23:49):**  systems.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:23:50):**  Nice.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:23:51):**  So let's move now and kind of use me as a case study because though my circumstances  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:23:57):**  are kind of unique, I would imagine that a lot of the things that I've been through in  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:24:01):**  my digestive journey could offer some insight for other people either suffering from similar  
**[0:24:07-0:24:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:24:07):**  ailments or who have struggled with some similar symptoms.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:24:10):**  So walk me through some of the questions and some of the assessments that you would make  
**[0:24:14-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:24:14):**  for someone in my condition.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:24:17):**  Sure.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:24:18):**  Okay, so I mean first off, I would probably ask you how long you have actually suffered  
**[0:24:25-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:24:25):**  from these digestive issues.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:24:27):**  Okay, so more or less for the last 12 years I've been having issues related to parasite  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:24:35):**  damage since I've been traveling because that's how long I've been kind of moving around internationally  
**[0:24:40-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:24:40):**  and damage from cycling on and off especially in the early years, antibiotic treatments  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:24:48):**  which I would imagine from what I've learned from other people has done a lot of damage  
**[0:24:53-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:24:53):**  to my personal microbiome.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:24:54):**  Yes, yes, antibiotics is somewhat like putting a bomb through your digestive system.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:25:00):**  It wipes out all the good and the bad.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:25:02):**  It definitely feels like it sometimes, yeah.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:25:05):**  Yeah, okay, so you said about 12 years.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:25:09):**  So was it really since you started traveling or what was happening or what else changed  
**[0:25:13-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:25:13):**  at that time in your life when you started experiencing these digestive issues?  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:25:19):**  Well traveling definitely was the largest change in my lifestyle at that time.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:25:23):**  I went to a couple of developing countries early on and I had some run-ins and some indigestion  
**[0:25:28-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:25:28):**  after like accidentally drinking river water or had some dirty food.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:25:34):**  Dairy food in Thailand is best to be avoided unless you have a better immune system but  
**[0:25:40-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:25:40):**  I didn't know that back then.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:25:43):**  And since then I've been into a lot of developing countries and a lot of circumstances where  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:25:46):**  just the sanitary conditions were poor and I've suffered from everything from giardia  
**[0:25:51-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:25:51):**  to salmonella to E. coli and pretty much everything in between.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:25:55):**  Okay, okay and so over these 12 years it's been quite consistent for you?  
**[0:26:01-0:26:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:26:01):**  Yeah, so even when I don't have something specifically infecting me or you know some  
**[0:26:09-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:26:09):**  sort of viral infection I'm usually either recovering from the damage from those parasites  
**[0:26:16-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:26:16):**  or like I said in the early years after taking antibiotics just having and not knowing how  
**[0:26:22-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:26:22):**  to repair this system after a dose of those.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:26:27):**  So I can't look back to a time when my digestion has been consistently good for any longer  
**[0:26:32-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:26:32):**  than say a month in those last 12 years.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:26:35):**  Okay and at those times when you did recognize that it was maybe a little bit better was  
**[0:26:40-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:26:40):**  did you were you able to like was there something that stood out like okay maybe this is helping  
**[0:26:47-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:26:47):**  my digestion right now?  
**[0:26:49-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:26:49):**  I think in a couple of circumstances my diet kind of became more consistent.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:26:55):**  I know in the Philippines when I was feeling better I was eating a lot of rice every day,  
**[0:26:59-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:26:59):**  a lot of fish and vegetables and that was pretty much it.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:27:01):**  It didn't very very often I didn't have a lot of either sweets or processed food and  
**[0:27:08-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:27:08):**  I was eating at a consistent times almost every day.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:27:11):**  Okay, okay and what does your food intake look like on a daily basis typically?  
**[0:27:22-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:27:22):**  These days I eat a whole lot of sweet potato.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:27:25):**  I've heard recommendations from other people that it's one of the better starch forms as  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:27:28):**  far as nutrition and digestibility.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:27:33):**  It's kind of like one of my staple foods.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:27:34):**  I also eat a lot of tortillas.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:27:36):**  I've tried to cut out beans but they're pretty common here in Guatemala where I live and  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:27:42):**  among that a lot of other root vegetables and I pretty much cook everything.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:27:47):**  I very rarely eat raw vegetables maybe only the occasional salad that I grow in my own  
**[0:27:53-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:27:53):**  farm.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:27:54):**  Okay, okay and are you eating any fruits?  
**[0:27:58-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:27:58):**  Not very often, most often bananas.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:28:00):**  Occasionally papaya or pineapple they're common around here as well.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:28:05):**  Okay, okay and what about your water right now?  
**[0:28:08-0:28:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:28:08):**  Is it, are you putting it through a filtration system or is it coming from a spring or?  
**[0:28:16-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:28:16):**  So where I am we get municipal water which comes from the river here in town and I think  
**[0:28:22-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:28:22):**  it's pretty minimally filtered but I do use sort of an eco filter which is a unfired clay  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:28:28):**  container and I think I've been pretty good with that.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:28:32):**  I wash it out regularly and I don't drink or cook with any water that hasn't been through  
**[0:28:37-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:28:37):**  that.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:28:38):**  Okay, okay.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:28:39):**  Yeah, I mean overall I mean with the food that you're eating they all sound like their  
**[0:28:46-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:28:46):**  whole foods and you're minimal on any processed or sugary foods so that's great.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:28:53):**  As for I mean when working with someone, when I work with someone with their digestive system  
**[0:28:58-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:28:58):**  obviously it's very personalized in terms of you know the steps we're going to take  
**[0:29:02-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:29:02):**  moving forward depending on where they are and the length of time and the symptoms that  
**[0:29:08-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:29:08):**  they're having and the lifestyle that they're living as well.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:29:12):**  But some things that would probably be beneficial for you is definitely I mean you mentioned  
**[0:29:19-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:29:19):**  the potatoes or the sweet potato as a starch.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:29:25):**  Foods actually that have resistant starch in them are very beneficial for the gut and  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:29:32):**  these you may have heard of them it's prebiotics so it's essentially the food for the bacteria  
**[0:29:38-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:29:38):**  or the microbes in the gut.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:29:41):**  So the probiotics are actually what we can take to bring into our bodies so we're actually  
**[0:29:48-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:29:48):**  bringing bacteria into our body but they're transient strains.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:29:51):**  They're not going to stay there for very long.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:29:52):**  They're going to kind of help us out and then you know be eliminated.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:29:57):**  Prebiotic foods are actually the foods that are going to feed our residential bacteria.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:30:02):**  So the bacteria that have always been in us and are living in us and they go into hiding  
**[0:30:07-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:30:07):**  when things get out of whack and in balance.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:30:10):**  So we want to eat more foods that are actually going to really feed those microbes.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:30:18):**  So helping the friendly gut bacteria and this starch produces short chain fatty acids and  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:30:26):**  ketones which is essentially fats that we can then use to burn as fuel.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:30:31):**  So resistant starch is really like a superfood kind of like for the gut.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:30:36):**  It helps to be beneficial for the gut bacteria and also for probiotic balance as well.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:30:44):**  So some of these foods are asparagus, carrots, garlic, Jerusalem artichoke, jicama, leeks,  
**[0:30:53-0:30:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:30:53):**  onions, radishes, chicory, flax, yacon, mushrooms.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:30:57):**  These are all really powerful foods when wanting to bring more resistant starch in and really  
**[0:31:04-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:31:04):**  help to fuel our gut microbiome.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:31:07):**  I was going to mention one other thing.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:31:11):**  The other thing with parasites because I've actually traveled a lot as well and one thing  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:31:19):**  that I do to help optimize my immune system and my digestive system when I'm traveling  
**[0:31:24-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:31:24):**  especially drinking different types of water is eating papaya seeds.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:31:32):**  So anytime I have a papaya –  
**[0:31:34-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:31:34):**  Yeah, that's a common one down here.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:31:35):**  A lot of people know about that remedy.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:31:37):**  Right.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:31:38):**  So they're very anti-parasitic and they've really – that's one thing that I've  
**[0:31:45-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:31:45):**  – I don't know if they're the reason why but I do incorporate them into my diet  
**[0:31:51-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:31:51):**  when I am in countries that have access to papaya.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:31:56):**  Some other things are cinnamon is also a very medicinal spice.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:32:01):**  It has a phenomenal level of antioxidants which are essentially – they fight the free  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:32:06):**  radicals in our body, so helping to ward it off cancer cells and a number of things.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:32:11):**  But they also help to fight fungal infections and viruses and cinnamon is also anti-parasitic.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:32:17):**  It's antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, so really helping to boost not only the immune  
**[0:32:23-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:32:23):**  system but also helping with the gut.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:32:26):**  There are also a few essential oils that I typically bring along with me.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:32:31):**  So the power of plants but in the form of essential oils and a couple of those are lemon.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:32:38):**  So the rinds of the lemon are used in lemon and essential oil.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:32:43):**  I mean lemon and citrus have been used for centuries for food poisoning, malaria, scurvy.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:32:51):**  But this – the rind oil provides – it's an antiviral, it's an antifungal and it's  
**[0:32:57-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:32:57):**  great for intestinal parasites as well.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:32:59):**  So dropping like a drop of a lemon essential oil, one that can be ingested because there's  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:33:04):**  a lot of essential oils that aren't similar to food.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:33:09):**  They have other artificial fillers in them or synthetic fillers.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:33:13):**  So if you do intend to use a lemon essential oil to help your system seeking out and doTERRA  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:33:22):**  is one of them and I can provide more information on that if you're interested but one that  
**[0:33:27-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:33:27):**  can be ingested.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:33:29):**  The other essential oil, oregano is a great one.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:33:33):**  It's an antibacterial, antifungal, anti-parasitic, also really great for simulating the immune  
**[0:33:39-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:33:39):**  system.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:33:41):**  So you drop a drop of oregano essential oil in the back of your throat and it can do wonders  
**[0:33:46-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:33:46):**  as well.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:33:47):**  So those are a few things especially when traveling and on the road.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:33:51):**  Marvelous.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:33:52):**  So that's really great for preventative care.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:33:55):**  Could you talk a little bit about how other people like myself, maybe if they've taken  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:33:59):**  antibiotics for a variety of reasons or who suffer from digestive issues either caused  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:34:04):**  by parasites or damage from poor diet, maybe what are some of the most effective steps  
**[0:34:09-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:34:09):**  that we can take to repair and regenerate our microbiome and our digestive health in  
**[0:34:15-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:34:15):**  turn?  
**[0:34:16-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:34:16):**  Definitely.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:34:17):**  So the first step is always remove.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:34:19):**  Removing any foods that are going to be fueling the bad bacteria and a lot of those foods  
**[0:34:25-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:34:25):**  come down to foods that many people generally like which is sugar, dairy and grains.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:34:35):**  So now it's not to say you have to cut all of these things out but depending on the state  
**[0:34:40-0:34:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:34:40):**  of your digestive system, it may be beneficial for you for a period of time, not necessarily  
**[0:34:45-0:34:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:34:45):**  for always but until your gut lining gets re-strengthened and your microbiome is healthy,  
**[0:34:51-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:34:51):**  then you can reintroduce them back in.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:34:53):**  But from genetically modified foods, so corn, soy, canola and sugar beet and any foods that  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:34:59):**  may have those in them, so a lot of the processed foods which is good for removing a lot of  
**[0:35:04-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:35:04):**  unnecessary sugar and untrue foods, not in their whole form.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:35:11):**  Dairy from conventionally grown dairy, so ones that are going to have a lot of hormones,  
**[0:35:16-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:35:16):**  antibiotics, those types of things in them as well as grains.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:35:23):**  For many, many people, the component of gluten which is gliadin is actually the sticky protein  
**[0:35:31-0:35:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:35:31):**  in grain products and that affects the intestinal barrier function.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:35:38):**  What it essentially does is simply put, it promotes this release of a protein called  
**[0:35:44-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:35:44):**  zoluene which controls the space between the cells that line your digestive track.  
**[0:35:49-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:35:49):**  When those spaces enlarge essentially having an increase in between the cells of your digestive  
**[0:36:00-0:36:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:36:00):**  track, that then allows a lot of protein, different protein to seep into the bloodstream  
**[0:36:08-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:36:08):**  leading to different inflammation throughout the body.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:36:12):**  Whether that's digestive issues or inflammatory, muscle, joint pain, even into brain, there's  
**[0:36:19-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:36:19):**  a lot of gut-brain connection as well when talking about the gut because the vagus nerve  
**[0:36:24-0:36:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:36:24):**  actually when we're in utero, when we're growing, the vagus nerve grows out towards our abdomen  
**[0:36:30-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:36:30):**  and up to our brain where it's directly connected.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:36:33):**  The gut-brain connection is very, very strong.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:36:40):**  There's a lot to be said when talking about the gut and what you can do but a lot of it  
**[0:36:44-0:36:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:36:44):**  would be coming down to looking into that person and in their state, what they are eating  
**[0:36:55-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:36:55):**  in the moment and then it would go down to what foods would be best to remove, what foods  
**[0:37:00-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:37:00):**  may be affecting you.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:37:02):**  The one other one I haven't mentioned is lectins.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:37:07):**  Lectins are essentially sugar-binding proteins and they act as a natural defense system for  
**[0:37:13-0:37:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:37:13):**  plants that protect them essentially from outside invaders when they're growing like  
**[0:37:18-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:37:18):**  mold and parasites when the plant is actually growing.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:37:21):**  But when humans come then to harvest those plants or beans or seeds, the lectin components  
**[0:37:29-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:37:29):**  of the protein of that food actually is not very good news for our gut.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:37:36):**  It's great news for the plant helping it survive and produce seed but not necessarily bad good  
**[0:37:41-0:37:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:37:41):**  news for our bodies and many people have sensitivities to lectins.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:37:47):**  A lot of lectins are found in the grains, in dairy, the casein, beans, legumes and the  
**[0:37:56-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:37:56):**  nightshade family.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:37:57):**  So the tomatoes, eggplants, cucumbers, squash as well as peanuts, cashews.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:38:05):**  So there's a number of foods in that category but the big thing is I always remind people  
**[0:38:11-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:38:11):**  is it's not that they're going to be out of your life forever.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:38:15):**  But if you want to get healthy and you want to feel good, there might be some time where  
**[0:38:20-0:38:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:38:20):**  you will have to remove some of these foods so you can allow your gut to actually heal  
**[0:38:24-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:38:24):**  and get strong and your intestinal lining to be closed off and powerful again before  
**[0:38:32-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:38:32):**  maybe bringing certain foods back into your diet depending on what your body feels at  
**[0:38:37-0:38:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:38:37):**  that moment in time.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:38:38):**  Wonderful, that's some very powerful information there, certainly very useful to me and probably  
**[0:38:43-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:38:43):**  a lot of other people suffering from similar conditions.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:38:46):**  Now obviously all of these things are very nuanced and detailed and as much as I would  
**[0:38:51-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:38:51):**  love to go into detail on all of them with you, we got to keep it kind of short.  
**[0:38:54-0:39:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:38:54):**  So I was wondering if you could put a billboard up around the world with just one message  
**[0:39:00-0:39:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:39:00):**  that you'd most like to communicate to the general population about health and nutrition,  
**[0:39:05-0:39:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:39:05):**  what would that be?  
**[0:39:06-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:39:06):**  Okay, this is a really hard question.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:39:09):**  We've got to distill it down a little bit otherwise this will be like an eight part  
**[0:39:13-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:39:13):**  series.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:39:14):**  Right, okay, so I think it would go hand in hand with, I mean now since I went through  
**[0:39:26-0:39:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:39:26):**  my permaculture journey really got reconnected, I really look at the world in a different  
**[0:39:34-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:39:34):**  way and simply put I think on a billboard would be mimic nature and your life will blossom.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:39:41):**  Very well said, I love that one, I'm going to try and use that.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:39:44):**  Now before I let you go, can you give us a great way to contact you and if anyone's interested  
**[0:39:50-0:39:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:39:50):**  in soliciting your services or finding out more information, where can they go to find  
**[0:39:55-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:39:55):**  you?  
**[0:39:56-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:39:56):**  Sure, so anyone can find me on social media, Breanne Gibson or at Circular Nutrition on

**[0:40:21-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:40:21):**  If anything today that I mentioned sparked interest, I do actually have a food swap guide  
**[0:40:30-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:40:30):**  out on there and really sharing some things to help renew the gut, rid brain frog, revamp  
**[0:40:36-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:40:36):**  energy that you can download and have some fresh and functional food swaps for ridding  
**[0:40:42-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:40:42):**  some of the top four foods that could be impacting your gut essentially.

**[0:41:02-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:41:02):**  Bye.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:41:03):**  So there you have it, but before we wrap things up for this episode and the first season,  
**[0:41:08-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:41:08):**  I want to thank all of you listeners, students and collaborators for making this such an  
**[0:41:12-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:41:12):**  incredible year for all of us at Abundant Edge.

**[0:41:19-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:41:19):**  all of our projects out in the field.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:41:22):**  I also want to remind you to stay tuned over the next couple of weeks when I'll be releasing  
**[0:41:25-0:41:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:41:25):**  small interlude episodes in which I'll be giving away exclusive information on early  
**[0:41:30-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:41:30):**  enrollment for our upcoming Regenerative Homesteading Apprenticeship, the 2018 Workshop Schedule,  
**[0:41:35-0:41:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:41:35):**  which includes the popular Intro to Permaculture and Intro to Natural Building that we offer  
**[0:41:39-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:41:39):**  with Atilan Organics, and also information on how to get your questions answered by our  
**[0:41:44-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-breanne-gibson/#t=0:41:44):**  panel of experts during a new monthly feature that I'll be calling Regenerative Roundtable.

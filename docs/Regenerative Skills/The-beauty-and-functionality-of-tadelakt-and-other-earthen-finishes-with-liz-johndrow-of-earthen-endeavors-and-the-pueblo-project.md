### Regenerative Skills  (Fri, 03 Feb 2017 12:03:55)
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to this episode of the abundant edge the podcast that delves into the worlds of natural building permaculture and regenerative living  
**[0:00:07-0:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:00:07):**  I'm your host Oliver Gautier. Let's get started  
**[0:00:20-0:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:00:20):**  Today I had the pleasure of talking with Liz Jondreau  
**[0:00:23-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:00:23):**  Liz is by far one of the most knowledgeable and thorough natural building instructors that I've had the pleasure of working with  
**[0:00:29-0:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:00:29):**  I first met Liz when I assisted on one of her natural building workshops at a titlan organics here on Lake Atitlan  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:00:36):**  Guatemala in which we covered a ton of material including bamboo framing  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:00:40):**  Cob and adobe mixing a number of different earthen wall systems including the indigenous  
**[0:00:46-0:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:00:46):**  Bahareke, which is a local type of wattle and daub and covered a ton of material about roofs natural foundations  
**[0:00:53-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:00:53):**  Plasters and even tattle act in this episode Liz talks about how she got started first in  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:01:00):**  Natural building and her journey in learning a number of different techniques as well as timber framing  
**[0:01:06-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:01:06):**  Straw bale and later getting into specializing in plasters. She talks about some of her projects here in Central America  
**[0:01:13-0:01:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:01:13):**  Including the pueblo project in which she works with indigenous communities in Nicaragua  
**[0:01:19-0:01:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:01:19):**  We also talked about the importance of including women in the process of construction and design and how much it can do for the community  
**[0:01:26-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:01:26):**  By including them in these processes. Liz is an absolute wealth of information and experience. So I hope you enjoy this interview. Here we go  
**[0:01:35-0:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:01:35):**  I'm here today with Liz Jondreau. Welcome and thank you for spending some time. Thanks for having me  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:01:41):**  So let's get right into it. What first got you interested in natural building?  
**[0:01:47-0:01:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:01:47):**  well  
**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:01:48):**  probably when I was really small I like to  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:01:52):**  tinker lots with wood and stuff in my dad's wood shop and  
**[0:01:57-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:01:57):**  started small with things like tinker toys and  
**[0:02:01-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:02:01):**  Continued learning with my brother who was a carpenter when I was in my teens and  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:02:11):**  Initially I was on a woman's carpentry crew in my early 20s and  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:02:15):**  And then I took a long break from building  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:02:19):**  But I always loved to work with my hands and work with wood and build things  
**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:02:25):**  That's great. So you actually had some members of your family who helped to guide you into it as well and then you took courses  
**[0:02:32-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:02:32):**  Yeah, you know I grew up in your typical  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:02:35):**  the boys got all the cool tools and I just followed along and  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:02:40):**  I tried to get my hands on him and I had a yeah one brother who  
**[0:02:46-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:02:46):**  is still a carpenter is a finished carpenter for his whole life and  
**[0:02:50-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:02:50):**  I got to work with him early on and then  
**[0:02:54-0:03:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:02:54):**  I found a group of women who brought me onto their crew and were my first teachers and  
**[0:03:02-0:03:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:03:02):**  Yeah, I didn't start taking courses till  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:03:05):**  Decades later I had a  
**[0:03:08-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:03:08):**  Couple of decades of raising a child and being a massage therapist in between and then I got back to  
**[0:03:16-0:03:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:03:16):**  Using my hands on  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:03:19):**  Building again, so I've always worked with my hands even when I was a massage therapist obviously. Yes  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:03:25):**  Now I know you've worked with a lot of different types of natural materials  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:03:30):**  I can't even keep track of all of them, but of all the different options of natural building materials straw bales Adobe  
**[0:03:35-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:03:35):**  What have you what made you choose to focus on the ones that you have?  
**[0:03:41-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:03:41):**  Well, probably some of them that I focused on is my love of the materials so I  
**[0:03:49-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:03:49):**  discovered working in  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:03:51):**  cob and mud and I love the sculptural aspect of that and  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:03:56):**  was definitely a continuation of my massage work and  
**[0:04:01-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:04:01):**  You know, I just love  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:04:03):**  kind of manipulating and sculpting with my hands and then  
**[0:04:08-0:04:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:04:08):**  As far as like working with wood. I think it really  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:04:13):**  Appealed to a part of me that wanted to  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:04:18):**  Strengthen being more precise and so I've always been fascinated with  
**[0:04:24-0:04:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:04:24):**  precision of working with wood and the  
**[0:04:26-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:04:26):**  Sculptability and creativity of working with earth. So those have always gone together and continue to  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:04:34):**  Be probably the two main  
**[0:04:37-0:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:04:37):**  materials that I work with  
**[0:04:39-0:04:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:04:39):**  So I went back into your website and kind of took a look at the evolution of some of the structures that you've worked on  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:04:46):**  Is it true that one of your first ones was a timber frame home with straw bales?  
**[0:04:51-0:04:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:04:51):**  Yeah, and where was that? So my first  
**[0:04:54-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:04:54):**  um, my very first straw bale that I worked on  
**[0:04:58-0:05:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:04:58):**  was in Utah and  
**[0:05:00-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:05:00):**  then  
**[0:05:01-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:05:01):**  the next one that I worked on from  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:05:05):**  Foundation to completion was a timber frame straw bale in Vermont  
**[0:05:10-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:05:10):**  And how does you go from those materials into Adobe and eventually working in Central America?  
**[0:05:17-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:05:17):**  Yeah, so I didn't really know or think I'd ever be working with Adobe  
**[0:05:24-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:05:24):**  I was living in Vermont  
**[0:05:26-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:05:26):**  I was working with wood and straw and a little bit of clay and a lot of lime plasters and I  
**[0:05:33-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:05:33):**  just was looking for  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:05:37):**  My work was really meaningful, but I was looking for something with deeper meaning for my  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:05:42):**  My personal life and I decided to  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:05:48):**  volunteer in Central America one winter and I suddenly  
**[0:05:53-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:05:53):**  realized I was in the middle of  
**[0:05:56-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:05:56):**  earthen architecture everywhere and  
**[0:05:59-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:05:59):**  It made a lot of sense to  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:06:03):**  Delve into that and help  
**[0:06:05-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:06:05):**  communities do improvements on their existing  
**[0:06:09-0:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:06:09):**  Adobe and earthen architecture  
**[0:06:11-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:06:11):**  so I  
**[0:06:13-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:06:13):**  I  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:06:15):**  Didn't really intentionally seek that out, but it came into my life sure  
**[0:06:21-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:06:21):**  Now you have also a lot of experience with natural plasters and finishes and I've even worked the hand with one of my favorite teachers  
**[0:06:28-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:06:28):**  Carol Cruz from Taos, New Mexico  
**[0:06:31-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:06:31):**  What are some of the most important things that beginners should know before they choose a certain type of natural finish?  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:06:37):**  For either a natural home or even for conventional homes  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:06:42):**  well, I think one of the first things they should know is that natural materials are  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:06:48):**  Are a bit more vulnerable than  
**[0:06:52-0:06:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:06:52):**  Some conventional materials and that it's important to know that when you're building the natural materials. There's  
**[0:06:59-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:06:59):**  a lifetime of maintenance as well and that's probably the first thing you should know is that you're going to  
**[0:07:08-0:07:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:07:08):**  If you put clay on your walls  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:07:11):**  it's probably best that you love those walls for the lifetime of those walls and  
**[0:07:17-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:07:17):**  So that takes a lot of time and  
**[0:07:20-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:07:20):**  Time and energy so I feel like natural building requires more time and energy than other materials once you get them on your walls  
**[0:07:27-0:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:07:27):**  So then what are some of the trade-offs if it costs a little bit more in energy and  
**[0:07:34-0:07:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:07:34):**  Maybe even education to get started using them. What are the benefits? Why should someone choose these over more conventional or industrial?  
**[0:07:42-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:07:42):**  products  
**[0:07:44-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:07:44):**  well  
**[0:07:46-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:07:46):**  question  
**[0:07:48-0:07:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:07:48):**  I think  
**[0:07:50-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:07:50):**  first of all, you know, we live on a  
**[0:07:52-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:07:52):**  planet with finite resources and  
**[0:07:55-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:07:55):**  You  
**[0:07:59-0:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:07:59):**  Know to be considerate of how the impact on the environment  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:08:04):**  with the resources we choose to use is a  
**[0:08:09-0:08:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:08:09):**  Really important consideration and  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:08:13):**  Raw materials some of them can be reproduced  
**[0:08:18-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:08:18):**  others  
**[0:08:20-0:08:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:08:20):**  Like clay soils are you know, they're there in abundance and they require very little  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:08:28):**  Embodied energy to get them from the ground to the wall. And so from an environmental impact  
**[0:08:36-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:08:36):**  Perspective it's a good way to go and  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:08:40):**  In places I work in Central America there people have more time  
**[0:08:45-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:08:45):**  Than money. And so even though natural materials are more labor intensive to extract and  
**[0:08:55-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:08:55):**  Work with  
**[0:08:57-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:08:57):**  Generally, they're affordable  
**[0:09:01-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:09:01):**  Certainly, there's that benefit. Yeah now that's mostly talking about clay plasters for those who aren't yet familiar with  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:09:09):**  Tattle act could you explain a little bit about what tattle act is and some of the applications that it's used for?  
**[0:09:14-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:09:14):**  yeah, so tattle act is a  
**[0:09:18-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:09:18):**  Moroccan lime plaster technique was discovered centuries ago and was originally used for  
**[0:09:29-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:09:29):**  Water containments and cisterns and then as it evolved it became a lot more of a decorative element in  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:09:38):**  Moroccan architecture, but we've  
**[0:09:41-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:09:41):**  as we use it in our  
**[0:09:45-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:09:45):**  Our part of the world it's become  
**[0:09:49-0:09:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:09:49):**  Since it's come here in modern times. It's usually  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:09:53):**  found to be used in like showers and  
**[0:09:58-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:09:58):**  Places where you want to create a beautiful  
**[0:10:01-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:10:01):**  highly polished  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:10:02):**  Finish that has a high water resistance  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:10:05):**  Now, why would you go through the trouble of using this rather than something like cement?  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:10:12):**  Especially in applications of earth and walls or natural materials. Well, I think largely it's an aesthetic  
**[0:10:20-0:10:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:10:20):**  people that are drawn to  
**[0:10:23-0:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:10:23):**  putting the time and energy into natural plasters  
**[0:10:26-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:10:26):**  That are clay or lime or even as refined and labor intensive as tattle act  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:10:32):**  Do it because they love the look and the feel and the aesthetic of it  
**[0:10:39-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:10:39):**  People who are really sensitive to their  
**[0:10:42-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:10:42):**  interior  
**[0:10:44-0:10:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:10:44):**  environments  
**[0:10:45-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:10:45):**  often  
**[0:10:46-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:10:46):**  feel  
**[0:10:47-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:10:47):**  that these more natural materials feel better and there are some studies that show that  
**[0:10:55-0:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:10:55):**  More natural  
**[0:10:57-0:11:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:10:57):**  Materials that mimic nature and are part of nature more naturally  
**[0:11:05-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:11:05):**  can  
**[0:11:06-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:11:06):**  Can have a positive impact on your immune system and your mood. So there's a whole spectrum of  
**[0:11:14-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:11:14):**  impact on a human being using these materials  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:11:18):**  So I've got it mostly I'd say it's like it's an aesthetic. Okay. Yeah now we've talked about  
**[0:11:24-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:11:24):**  Clay plasters a little about lime plasters  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:11:27):**  There are a couple of other kind of minor options and a whole lot of different types of mixes that you can  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:11:32):**  Combine all of these things with could you explain some of the reasons why someone would want to choose a certain type of?  
**[0:11:38-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:11:38):**  plaster or finish over another  
**[0:11:41-0:11:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:11:41):**  What are some of the benefits and disadvantages of some of the main types of plastic?  
**[0:11:45-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:11:45):**  Well, the main ones that I work with are  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:11:48):**  clay based or lime based  
**[0:11:51-0:11:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:11:51):**  and  
**[0:11:52-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:11:52):**  the other type of  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:11:54):**  render stucco would be a cement based and then there's  
**[0:11:59-0:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:11:59):**  combining and combining those and  
**[0:12:02-0:12:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:12:02):**  so  
**[0:12:04-0:12:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:12:04):**  Again clay based plasters are  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:12:07):**  Very easy to apply very easy to maintain  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:12:11):**  Very forgiving to a beginner who's learning how to do plasters  
**[0:12:18-0:12:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:12:18):**  Clay based plasters are just  
**[0:12:20-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:12:20):**  hydration and dehydration so it allows you to  
**[0:12:25-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:12:25):**  Rehydrate them and fix them if you're in the process of doing it or as you maintain your walls, so  
**[0:12:34-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:12:34):**  clay would be  
**[0:12:36-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:12:36):**  the kind of a great beginners plaster  
**[0:12:39-0:12:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:12:39):**  but it's gonna be probably the most vulnerable because if it gets rehydrated in a rain or something it's going to get weakened and  
**[0:12:48-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:12:48):**  Can  
**[0:12:50-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:12:50):**  fall apart some so you have to  
**[0:12:53-0:13:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:12:53):**  Realize when you do clay plasters that they tend to be a little more vulnerable and you have to you have to consider that  
**[0:13:00-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:13:00):**  But they're easy to maintain so a lot of people prefer them for that reason  
**[0:13:07-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:13:07):**  They also have a very  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:13:10):**  soft feel to them  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:13:12):**  and people prefer that now limes a  
**[0:13:16-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:13:16):**  stronger plaster and  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:13:18):**  It um it can handle  
**[0:13:23-0:13:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:13:23):**  Weather humidity and direct moisture much better than clay  
**[0:13:31-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:13:31):**  But  
**[0:13:32-0:13:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:13:32):**  It doesn't necessarily do so great in  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:13:35):**  Exteriors in climates where you get a lot of moisture into the wall, and then it freezes and thaws  
**[0:13:40-0:13:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:13:40):**  So there's limitations with the lime, but it is more durable than the clay generally so it  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:13:49):**  Also has a curing process so it gives you less time to be able to fuss with it  
**[0:13:53-0:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:13:53):**  And you can't just re-wet it to fix it and it's a little bit more challenging to repair it and maintain it  
**[0:14:01-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:14:01):**  So you've kind of stepped up in durability, but you've also stepped up in  
**[0:14:05-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:14:05):**  Skill level and  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:14:10):**  Challenges with maintaining and then we won't really talk about cement here  
**[0:14:15-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:14:15):**  One thing I do want to talk about cement  
**[0:14:18-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:14:18):**  Tell me why you wouldn't want to use cement on especially earthen walls well  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:14:27):**  What I found I haven't seen that much cement on earthen walls until I came to Central America  
**[0:14:33-0:14:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:14:33):**  And what I saw immediately was these earthen these adobe homes that had never been plastered  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:14:40):**  There's not a tradition  
**[0:14:43-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:14:43):**  In the pueblos that I initially  
**[0:14:46-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:14:46):**  Ended up in there's not a tradition of plastering and what's recently happened is  
**[0:14:53-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:14:53):**  with block with concrete block being  
**[0:14:56-0:14:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:14:56):**  coming into the  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:14:58):**  Building the construction scene in these countries  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:15:04):**  Cement stucco is put on the block and people like the look of this  
**[0:15:10-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:15:10):**  This plaster this stucco so then architects and builders started putting the cement stucco on these adobe houses  
**[0:15:18-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:15:18):**  and I  
**[0:15:20-0:15:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:15:20):**  saw a  
**[0:15:22-0:15:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:15:22):**  lot of  
**[0:15:24-0:15:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:15:24):**  cement plasters or stuccos on adobe that were one or two years old that  
**[0:15:30-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:15:30):**  Were already falling off because they don't  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:15:33):**  They don't connect to the to the adobe and so it basically makes this hard skin  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:15:39):**  That's not really hanging on it's more like it's a shell and so as soon as any moisture gets under it  
**[0:15:46-0:15:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:15:46):**  it tends to  
**[0:15:48-0:15:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:15:48):**  Make the adobe swell a little bit and creates a crack in this cement shell and then it just starts to just fall off  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:15:56):**  It's not holding on at all if you wrap the whole adobe building in  
**[0:16:01-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:16:01):**  Wire or you know some kind of mesh  
**[0:16:05-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:16:05):**  It would less likely fall off  
**[0:16:07-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:16:07):**  But it still holds moisture in there and causes problems and degrades the adobe and they're just not a good  
**[0:16:13-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:16:13):**  Pairing yeah, they're not really compatible. Yeah, yeah their properties kind of fight each other  
**[0:16:20-0:16:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:16:20):**  I don't know about you, but  
**[0:16:23-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:16:23):**  Since we both worked in the southwest of the United States  
**[0:16:26-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:16:26):**  There's been a lot of examples of that in even the communities around Taos that historical church the San Francisco de Assisi  
**[0:16:34-0:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:16:34):**  Was one of the more famous examples of you know it had been plastered with mud annually for  
**[0:16:41-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:16:41):**  hundreds of years and  
**[0:16:44-0:16:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:16:44):**  Then somebody got the bright idea to cover it in cement stucco and over the course of about I think 25 or 30 years  
**[0:16:51-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:16:51):**  between the 50s and the 70s  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:16:53):**  People didn't realize the effect of what had happened and they didn't see what was going on  
**[0:16:58-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:16:58):**  Yeah  
**[0:16:58-0:17:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:16:58):**  And he started from seeing but it kept the moisture and it created a huge amount of erosion in the interior of the adobe  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:17:05):**  And when they finally figured this out  
**[0:17:07-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:17:07):**  They had to take everything off  
**[0:17:09-0:17:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:17:09):**  Do major reconstruction on the walls and the interior and now they've gone back to annually  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:17:16):**  Replastering with mud right right and yeah, that's one of the more famous examples, but yes, it's a high maintenance  
**[0:17:22-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:17:22):**  But the community comes together every year and maintains it and if there's anything happening. It's highly visible so  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:17:30):**  putting anything on  
**[0:17:32-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:17:32):**  Oh building or you know in a situation where you can't see what's happening under it is probably not a good  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:17:40):**  Sure, yeah, it definitely makes the the troubleshooting or identifying where there's problems a whole lot more difficult  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:17:47):**  So switching gears a little bit here. You've talked a little of your work in Central America  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:17:52):**  Tell me a little bit about the Pueblo project so the Pueblo project is a small  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:17:58):**  Or we grassroots organization that I began after  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:18:03):**  So I originally went to Nicaragua in 2011 and I spent several months there  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:18:09):**  I went down to volunteer, and I just really wanted to learn Spanish and  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:18:15):**  Have a cultural experience and offer whatever I could offer to the community  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:18:20):**  I was staying with I didn't know whether I'd be working in a health center or what I'd be doing  
**[0:18:25-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:18:25):**  but once I got there and I saw the  
**[0:18:28-0:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:18:28):**  Earth and architecture and I saw the failing cement stucco's and I just saw this huge potential to  
**[0:18:36-0:18:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:18:36):**  support these women in these communities to beautify and their homes with really simple affordable  
**[0:18:44-0:18:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:18:44):**  Changes so I went back  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:18:46):**  Well the first year we built a community center and several women's  
**[0:18:51-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:18:51):**  organizations were involved and  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:18:53):**  We built that in the community in northern Nicaragua  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:18:58):**  Savannah Grande with an organization Grupo Phoenix and that  
**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:19:03):**  learning center that we built that year continues to be the laboratory and  
**[0:19:08-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:19:08):**  the  
**[0:19:10-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:19:10):**  Yeah, the natural building laboratory where when a new skill is learned or a skill is improved upon  
**[0:19:16-0:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:19:16):**  They go back to that space and in often in  
**[0:19:20-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:19:20):**  In  
**[0:19:22-0:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:19:22):**  International aid kind of  
**[0:19:26-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:19:26):**  Situations buildings happen really quickly and the organizations leave and the buildings always look best  
**[0:19:32-0:19:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:19:32):**  day one and then they start to look worse and worse and worse and  
**[0:19:37-0:19:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:19:37):**  We've had an opposite effect with this community where this building looks better and better and better all the time  
**[0:19:43-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:19:43):**  So that really showed me that  
**[0:19:46-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:19:46):**  There was something to be followed up on here. And so I've continued to go back  
**[0:19:53-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:19:53):**  this will be my sixth season and  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:19:56):**  we have now grown into a small organization and  
**[0:20:02-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:20:02):**  What we focus on is  
**[0:20:06-0:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:20:06):**  Building  
**[0:20:07-0:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:20:07):**  Skills that can be transferred within these communities using local  
**[0:20:12-0:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:20:12):**  raw materials  
**[0:20:14-0:20:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:20:14):**  doing  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:20:15):**  modern adaptations on their traditional  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:20:19):**  architecture of Adobe and other styles of earthen building and  
**[0:20:24-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:20:24):**  giving women and youth  
**[0:20:27-0:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:20:27):**  Priority in learning these skills and having opportunity to use these skills within their homes within their families  
**[0:20:34-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:20:34):**  and within their communities, so  
**[0:20:38-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:20:38):**  Yeah, so that's kind of the mission and vision of the Pueblo project  
**[0:20:42-0:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:20:42):**  And so how do some of these projects get started? How do the workshops go and where do you find participants?  
**[0:20:50-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:20:50):**  so  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:20:52):**  In all the organs in all the communities I've worked on worked in I've gone through a local  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:20:59):**  organization that has a similar kind of a mission of  
**[0:21:03-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:21:03):**  empowering women or giving the community  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:21:07):**  Skills that will help with resiliency in  
**[0:21:10-0:21:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:21:10):**  in  
**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:21:11):**  you know these times of climate change and  
**[0:21:15-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:21:15):**  giving them opportunities to  
**[0:21:18-0:21:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:21:18):**  Improve upon, you know their lives within the limits of what exists in their culture and environment at this time. So  
**[0:21:28-0:21:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:21:28):**  What  
**[0:21:29-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:21:29):**  Has happened is these different organizations. They have a different focus than us, but they have this overall vision. That's similar so  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:21:37):**  We approached our work through a woman's renewable energy  
**[0:21:43-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:21:43):**  organization  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:21:45):**  agricultural organization a woman's carpentry school and we're hoping  
**[0:21:50-0:21:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:21:50):**  We have connections with the woman's beekeeping  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:21:54):**  cooperative and so these are all the groups that we go through into the community and  
**[0:22:00-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:22:00):**  Invite the women and youth of those communities to come participate in  
**[0:22:06-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:22:06):**  In these workshops and then once that is established we might open the workshop to  
**[0:22:13-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:22:13):**  international  
**[0:22:15-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:22:15):**  Folk to create a bit of a inter  
**[0:22:18-0:22:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:22:18):**  exchange  
**[0:22:20-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:22:20):**  Kind of a learning environment  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:22:23):**  But primarily we focus on the women and the youth of the communities first  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:22:29):**  It's fantastic. Now you were talking about how some of your projects have had the opposite effect  
**[0:22:34-0:22:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:22:34):**  There's other organizations going in there where?  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:22:37):**  the projects that you start actually improve in your absence rather than degrade as  
**[0:22:43-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:22:43):**  You know so many other projects do  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:22:45):**  For lack of maintenance lack of funding or something once the organization leaves  
**[0:22:49-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:22:49):**  How do you think that?  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:22:51):**  You've been able to achieve that and what have been some of the effects on the community that have helped to sustain your projects  
**[0:22:58-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:22:58):**  well  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:22:59):**  choosing organizations that  
**[0:23:02-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:23:02):**  are  
**[0:23:04-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:23:04):**  Interested really truly interested in what we have to offer as opposed to us. Just like trying to really put it on to  
**[0:23:12-0:23:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:23:12):**  those communities so  
**[0:23:15-0:23:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:23:15):**  trying to draw out  
**[0:23:17-0:23:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:23:17):**  organizations and communities that  
**[0:23:20-0:23:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:23:20):**  Truly can do some follow-up even if we financially help with that, but that they can do some follow-up  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:23:27):**  Going back season every year and seeing what skills  
**[0:23:34-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:23:34):**  They've carried on with so we begin to learn what?  
**[0:23:37-0:23:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:23:37):**  They're interested in truly as opposed to what they might pretend they're interested in because they're being offered something  
**[0:23:45-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:23:45):**  so giving them time and space to  
**[0:23:49-0:23:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:23:49):**  Take the skills and then see what happens with that and then in the next course  
**[0:23:53-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:23:53):**  We enforce those skills so being able to be flexible and following the  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:24:00):**  interests of each of the communities  
**[0:24:04-0:24:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:24:04):**  What else works for us I guess some  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:24:07):**  yeah, mostly really just returning and  
**[0:24:12-0:24:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:24:12):**  reinforcing the skills and the confidence building and the  
**[0:24:15-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:24:15):**  Opportunity to do more and I think a lot of what I love to do is beautifying so even if we're just doing a plaster  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:24:23):**  And our clay sculpted wall it  
**[0:24:27-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:24:27):**  It can really  
**[0:24:29-0:24:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:24:29):**  Excite the community and a lot of people will want that so then we can also add the composting toilet and the improved cookstove  
**[0:24:36-0:24:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:24:36):**  and  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:24:37):**  The improved Adobe technique, but sometimes it's just starting with a simple community  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:24:42):**  Mural made with clay plasters and paints or something  
**[0:24:47-0:24:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:24:47):**  Sure, and I can imagine with each new project you establish a more profound relationship with the communities that you work with and  
**[0:24:55-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:24:55):**  gain a rapport and an amount of  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:24:57):**  Respectability that adds credentials to whatever other initiative you're taking on there  
**[0:25:02-0:25:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:25:02):**  Now you said that you've been going back for six seasons now. This will be my sixth season  
**[0:25:07-0:25:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:25:07):**  Okay, yeah, and where do you see the project advancing in the years to come the seasons to come well right now  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:25:13):**  We're shifting in this year. We're shifting from  
**[0:25:17-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:25:17):**  doing a lot of workshops and community buildings to  
**[0:25:24-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:25:24):**  Teaching so we've started a program  
**[0:25:27-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:25:27):**  We're calling on training the trainers  
**[0:25:29-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:25:29):**  So we have all these students from the past five seasons who are really strong in the practical skills  
**[0:25:36-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:25:36):**  We've given them lots of opportunities to  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:25:41):**  Learn how to do plasters well and earth and floors well and Adobe well and all these different things  
**[0:25:46-0:25:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:25:46):**  They can do them really well and now because they're in very rural communities and they haven't had a lot of education opportunity  
**[0:25:55-0:25:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:25:55):**  Now we're focusing on giving them some really solid  
**[0:26:00-0:26:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:26:00):**  training on  
**[0:26:01-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:26:01):**  Teaching others. So this season we're gonna go into those communities where we've been working and  
**[0:26:08-0:26:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:26:08):**  Actually do week-long training the trainer  
**[0:26:13-0:26:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:26:13):**  Facilitation where they'll actually  
**[0:26:15-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:26:15):**  have opportunities to be up in front of a classroom or in front of a group and get feedback and  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:26:21):**  Evaluation and skills and tools to to teach classes  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:26:25):**  so we're feeling like we're trying to you know work ourselves out of a job there and that  
**[0:26:30-0:26:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:26:30):**  eventually  
**[0:26:32-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:26:32):**  we'll just go down to  
**[0:26:35-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:26:35):**  You know see what exciting things they've created and if we have some new skill like Tattle Act  
**[0:26:42-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:26:42):**  That we might introduce we'll do a little workshop and but we're we're shifting towards  
**[0:26:50-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:26:50):**  Focusing on making them the teachers and so I think we'll have  
**[0:26:54-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:26:54):**  Hopefully less and less presence in a lot of ways and then being able to start focusing in other parts of the world  
**[0:27:02-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:27:02):**  Fantastic. Yeah  
**[0:27:04-0:27:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:27:04):**  Now one of the things that I really admire about your work and take some time to talk about  
**[0:27:08-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:27:08):**  I know you're a big proponent of bringing women into natural building and also the design and construction process in general  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:27:16):**  you tell me a little bit about why this is so important for moving forward and  
**[0:27:20-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:27:20):**  What are we missing by keeping construction sites so male-dominated?  
**[0:27:25-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:27:25):**  Well, I think I've had different experiences in different parts of the world. So when I'm working in Central America  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:27:32):**  when I'm working in a small rural community where the household is  
**[0:27:39-0:27:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:27:39):**  100% run by the woman she might even be a single mom with a bunch of kids. It's not that uncommon  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:27:46):**  That is her household that is her house and  
**[0:27:53-0:27:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:27:53):**  To have so little  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:27:55):**  Say over the design in the construction and the layout of it  
**[0:28:01-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:28:01):**  Makes a little sense to me  
**[0:28:03-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:28:03):**  that  
**[0:28:04-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:28:04):**  In a place like that  
**[0:28:07-0:28:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:28:07):**  Giving and these women know how to work hard  
**[0:28:09-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:28:09):**  They work very hard already. So simply giving them more skills. They're already very hard working  
**[0:28:17-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:28:17):**  They already know  
**[0:28:19-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:28:19):**  What is going to well, they have some idea  
**[0:28:23-0:28:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:28:23):**  What kind of design is gonna work best for them in a kitchen and a garden and you know?  
**[0:28:29-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:28:29):**  The whole space of their home  
**[0:28:32-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:28:32):**  Yeah, just giving them tools and opportunity  
**[0:28:35-0:28:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:28:35):**  that in a way just allows them to do what they need to do in their own home and  
**[0:28:43-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:28:43):**  It doesn't really take them out into the world of construction. But what we have been able to do  
**[0:28:51-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:28:51):**  Because that's a huge hurdle in a place like you know, Central America  
**[0:28:55-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:28:55):**  but what we have been able to do is bring them into workshops and bring some local builders into the workshop and  
**[0:29:02-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:29:02):**  Really help them understand  
**[0:29:05-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:29:05):**  the prejudice around gender and construction and give often give these men an  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:29:12):**  opportunity to work alongside these women in a new way and gain the respect of  
**[0:29:17-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:29:17):**  That they simply weren't working alongside them because of just some cultural bias has nothing to do with capability and  
**[0:29:24-0:29:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:29:24):**  You know the ability to do do the work so that's probably what we've done most  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:29:32):**  In you know the work I'm doing in Nicaragua  
**[0:29:36-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:29:36):**  Of course in the States women have so much more opportunity. It still  
**[0:29:44-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:29:44):**  can be  
**[0:29:45-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:29:45):**  Scary to step into a construction site and I've heard this from many women  
**[0:29:51-0:29:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:29:51):**  And I think that's why  
**[0:29:56-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:29:56):**  Natural building is just such a wonderful  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:30:00):**  It's just a wonderful place for women to be recognized because  
**[0:30:04-0:30:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:30:04):**  they are so drawn and comfortable to working with all these natural materials and  
**[0:30:11-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:30:11):**  It doesn't go immediately  
**[0:30:13-0:30:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:30:13):**  to  
**[0:30:15-0:30:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:30:15):**  Maybe some intimidating elements like lots of power tools right at the beginning or something like that  
**[0:30:21-0:30:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:30:21):**  It gives you know Cobb can be a great gateway drug to natural building  
**[0:30:27-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:30:27):**  And you know, it's just mixing some of it, but you know clean sand and strong water  
**[0:30:31-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:30:31):**  And so it's a little like, you know  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:30:36):**  Cooking so maybe it's not so, you know out of the realm of comfort and  
**[0:30:41-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:30:41):**  so  
**[0:30:42-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:30:42):**  you know just being able to step in and start to feel these materials that are familiar and then start to  
**[0:30:48-0:30:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:30:48):**  take them and you know construct with them is a  
**[0:30:53-0:31:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:30:53):**  comfortable place for a lot of women and so I think the natural building movement has been very very supportive of  
**[0:31:00-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:31:00):**  Bringing women in now as far as that whole like construction site vibe  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:31:05):**  it's still there and we're just just something that's got to be talked about and and  
**[0:31:11-0:31:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:31:11):**  Women continue to pioneer and and keep talking about it and have men listen and we'll get there someday  
**[0:31:21-0:31:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:31:21):**  Everyone was making steps in the right direction. Yeah, I agree  
**[0:31:24-0:31:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:31:24):**  I've found that since I switched over to working on natural building sites and less within you know  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:31:30):**  Industrial construction and you know maritime engineering is where I started as well  
**[0:31:36-0:31:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:31:36):**  the attitude and the  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:31:38):**  I don't know the the general feel and I  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:31:43):**  Would say the communication that is facilitated by including more people  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:31:48):**  especially within these natural building sites that I've worked on has created an environment of  
**[0:31:55-0:32:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:31:55):**  Better understanding and a lot of great new ideas for the inclusion of more people being involved  
**[0:32:01-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:32:01):**  and I really love that aspect about what you promote in your workshops and  
**[0:32:07-0:32:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:32:07):**  Through your website and through your projects as well. So  
**[0:32:13-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:32:13):**  Before I let you go here  
**[0:32:15-0:32:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:32:15):**  Would you like to?  
**[0:32:16-0:32:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:32:16):**  Describe for the listeners how they could get in touch with you how they could find you and your projects  
**[0:32:22-0:32:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:32:22):**  Especially the problem of projects and possibly even donate. Yeah, that's always a great idea  
**[0:32:29-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:32:29):**  Yeah, so I have find me on Facebook I have  
**[0:32:34-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:32:34):**  my business page Earthen Endeavors natural building and  
**[0:32:40-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:32:40):**  I also have  
**[0:32:43-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:32:43):**  Nicaragua Pueblo Project is the other Facebook page and then I have a website for both so  
**[0:32:51-0:32:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:32:51):**  Nicaragua Pueblo Project dot org and  
**[0:32:55-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:32:55):**  earthen endeavors  
**[0:32:56-0:32:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:32:56):**  dot-com are two places I  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:32:59):**  have on both of those contacts for my  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:33:05):**  Email, but it's naturalplasters at gmail.com on the Pueblo Project page  
**[0:33:11-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:33:11):**  It's really easy to go to the give page and donate  
**[0:33:16-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:33:16):**  through  
**[0:33:17-0:33:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:33:17):**  We have a fiscal sponsor way of compassion that allows for tax deductible donations and we rely  
**[0:33:25-0:33:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:33:25):**  a hundred percent at this point on your donations and  
**[0:33:31-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:33:31):**  A hundred percent goes to the projects. We have pretty much zero  
**[0:33:37-0:33:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:33:37):**  administrative costs at this time  
**[0:33:39-0:33:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:33:39):**  The money goes directly to the communities and getting us to the communities to work with the women and youth. So  
**[0:33:47-0:33:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:33:47):**  It's dollars well given and well spent  
**[0:33:51-0:33:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:33:51):**  Thank you so much for taking time Liz. It's always a pleasure to talk to you  
**[0:33:55-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:33:55):**  I'm gonna miss you when you leave today's your last day in Guatemala. It's been such a pleasure working with you and  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:34:02):**  Watching you teach. I've learned a ton in the few weeks that we've gotten to spend together. So thank you very much  
**[0:34:07-0:34:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-006-liz-johndrow/#t=0:34:07):**  Thanks. All right. Take care. Bye

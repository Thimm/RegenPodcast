**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:00:00):**  This is Regenerative Skills, the podcast helping you to learn the skills and solutions to create  
**[0:00:08-0:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:00:08):**  an abundant and connected future.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:00:10):**  I'm your host, Oliver Gautier.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:00:14):**  If you're enjoying the ideas and inspiration from the wide variety of guests and their  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:00:18):**  experiences from the last five seasons of this podcast, just know that the best way  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:00:23):**  to take the next step and deepen your knowledge in order to apply the skills and learning  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:00:27):**  to regenerate your world is to read a book.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:00:31):**  New Society Publishers' vision is to provide the world with fundamental tools to help build  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:00:35):**  a just and ecologically sustainable society, and many of the guests that I've interviewed  
**[0:00:40-0:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:00:40):**  here on the show are authors published by them.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:00:43):**  You can find all of their work in ebook, audiobook, and classic paperback at newsociety.org.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:00:52):**  Hello and welcome back everybody!  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:00:54):**  As we continue to dive deeper into this series on how to build strong communities, I wanted  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:00:58):**  to take the time to try and understand some of the unique challenges of some of the most  
**[0:01:03-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:01:03):**  difficult community circumstances.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:01:04):**  Now I'm talking specifically about refugee settlements and communities of displaced people.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:01:10):**  It's unfortunately true that camps and shelters for people who have been forced to move are  
**[0:01:15-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:01:15):**  growing massively in recent years.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:01:18):**  Conflicts like those in Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Syria, and most recently in Ukraine have caused  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:01:24):**  millions of people to flee to neighboring countries and further abroad in just the last  
**[0:01:29-0:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:01:29):**  couple of years.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:01:31):**  Conflict is certainly not the only reason though for mass migration.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:01:35):**  Natural disasters are being exacerbated, and floods, fires, droughts, and storms are increasing  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:01:40):**  in intensity and frequency, causing a growing population of climate refugees.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:01:45):**  Now while there are many different approaches to solving these growing issues, I want to  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:01:49):**  focus on how to bring progress and hope of regeneration to the people in these vulnerable  
**[0:01:54-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:01:54):**  living situations.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:01:56):**  Now I have my own experiences from living in developing areas of the world.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:02:00):**  I distinctly remember teaching courses in the houses of my neighbors in Guatemala in  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:02:04):**  order to build more efficient earthen cook stoves for people who were used to cooking  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:02:08):**  on open fires in one-room adobe houses.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:02:12):**  During my travels, I've seen and interacted with many communities of few material and  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:02:17):**  financial means, but I've never worked closely with displaced people or gotten to know the  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:02:22):**  challenges they face, and so for this perspective, I reached out to Morag Gamble about her direct  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:02:27):**  work with the refugee settlements in different countries.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:02:31):**  Morag is the founder of the Global Permaculture Education Institute.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:02:35):**  She teaches permaculture educators and permaculture activists online, but also in universities,  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:02:41):**  libraries, ecovillages, community gardens, and especially refugee settlements on 6 different  
**[0:02:46-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:02:46):**  continents.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:02:47):**  She experiments with one planet living at her ecovillage home in Australia, and in her  
**[0:02:52-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:02:52):**  award-winning permaculture garden where she has lived since 1998 with her family.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:02:58):**  Morag also mentors the Global Perma Youth and has supported over 1,500 refugee youth  
**[0:03:03-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:03:03):**  and women to access free permaculture education through her charity Ethos Foundation.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:03:09):**  She's a permaculture writer, podcaster, YouTuber, and blogger who speaks up for the well-being  
**[0:03:14-0:03:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:03:14):**  of life on this planet as a planetarian or permaculture activist.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:03:20):**  Morag is also a core member of Permaculture for Refugees and collaborates with permaculture  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:03:25):**  humanitarian organizations and speaks daily to refugees.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:03:31):**  In this interview, we start by exploring how Morag's background in permaculture instruction  
**[0:03:35-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:03:35):**  led to her working with displaced communities.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:03:38):**  She helps me to understand both the differences and the similarities between refugee communities  
**[0:03:43-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:03:43):**  compared to others that she has worked with.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:03:46):**  We also talk in-depth about how permaculture education is relevant to people who've been  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:03:50):**  displaced and are living in extremely difficult circumstances with scarce resources.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:03:55):**  We shed light on the concepts that have really stuck with the people that she has worked  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:03:59):**  with there, and how they've integrated the concepts into their own knowledge, their own  
**[0:04:03-0:04:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:04:03):**  culture, and interpretations.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:04:06):**  It's really worth sticking around to the end of this as well as we explore Morag's vision  
**[0:04:10-0:04:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:04:10):**  for how the international community could transform how it deals with displaced communities,  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:04:16):**  and how we could all begin to see these people for the incredible potential and the gifts  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:04:20):**  that they bring with them to the communities they seek refuge in, and how we might contribute  
**[0:04:24-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:04:24):**  to their recovery and integration.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:04:27):**  We also explore how people who are interested in getting involved with this kind of important  
**[0:04:31-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:04:31):**  work can get started.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:04:32):**  In fact, Morag has an online course right now that can serve as a stepping stone into  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:04:37):**  bringing hope and ecological abundance to these vulnerable communities.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:04:41):**  And I've included a special link to learn more about it at the top of the page on the  
**[0:04:44-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:04:44):**  show notes for this episode on the website.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:04:47):**  So with all of that said, I'll hand things over now to Morag Gamble.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:04:52):**  This is, I think, a really good topic to introduce you through because of the focus on building  
**[0:04:59-0:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:04:59):**  community.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:05:01):**  And that's been so central to your teachings from what I know of your work.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:05:04):**  And though you're an educator of educators as well, the idea is to disseminate this information  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:05:10):**  so that people can apply it down at the community level and adapt it to their local conditions,  
**[0:05:15-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:05:15):**  right?  
**[0:05:16-0:05:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:05:16):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:05:17):**  Now, with all of these interactions that you've had and the experience from around the world,  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:05:21):**  how did you get into working with refugee communities?  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:05:26):**  I've often done a lot of work with various communities around the world.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:05:32):**  My permaculture journey's taken me to so many different countries and I end up in a lot  
**[0:05:37-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:05:37):**  of villages.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:05:40):**  And in one of those villages in Africa, part of the course that was being held, as I'm  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:05:49):**  getting more experienced in permaculture, I find myself stepping back more.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:05:54):**  And it's really interesting because I don't, I see the importance of just supporting local  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:06:02):**  educators and local systems to emerge.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:06:06):**  And one of these courses in Africa, we were able to help sponsor a number of people to  
**[0:06:13-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:06:13):**  come in from various refugee settlements.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:06:15):**  And it was in that that I started to build a really direct friendship with a number of  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:06:21):**  people who are from refugee settlements.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:06:23):**  And in hearing about their stories, how they ended up there, how long they'd been there,  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:06:30):**  what life was like there, once you kind of know that kind of stuff, you can't unknow  
**[0:06:36-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:06:36):**  it.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:06:37):**  And there was just no way of not working with them from that point.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:06:42):**  Because in terms of what permaculture is able to offer, it's such the practical kind of  
**[0:06:50-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:06:50):**  basic know-how and skills and resources and community building type of activity that is  
**[0:06:58-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:06:58):**  necessary there.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:07:00):**  And not just me saying that, as they take it back themselves and start to set up these  
**[0:07:06-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:07:06):**  programs, the kind of stories that I've been hearing is that this is kind of a difference  
**[0:07:12-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:07:12):**  that is making a difference in our communities.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:07:14):**  It's helping to bring people together.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:07:16):**  It's addressing basic things like nutrition so that our kids have something to put into  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:07:23):**  their bodies that keeps them well, because there's so much sickness in these settlements.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:07:29):**  And so, you know, so many stories coming back how positive it is.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:07:35):**  Just one thing led to another.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:07:38):**  And now I feel like most of the world in which I work with permaculture is through that lens.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:07:44):**  I mean, it's an everyday thing that I do now.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:07:48):**  And what have been some of the things that you have noticed that are unique or different  
**[0:07:52-0:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:07:52):**  about these refugee communities beyond just the hardship and the circumstances that many  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:07:58):**  of the people are there under?  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:08:00):**  Because I would imagine that they're still mostly similar to communities around the world.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:08:05):**  Like we have more in common than we do in different.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:08:07):**  But what are some of the things that are worth taking stock of and being aware of at least  
**[0:08:13-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:08:13):**  as far as differences?  
**[0:08:15-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:08:15):**  Well, I think one of the key things that makes it work so beautifully there, which may be  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:08:24):**  a bit of a difference, is that the need is so great.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:08:28):**  And so it becomes so much more clear that these are the kinds of solutions that help  
**[0:08:35-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:08:35):**  to bring the changes that are needed.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:08:38):**  You know, if you're living in a camp where you get, you know, three dollars a month to  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:08:41):**  help you buy food, it's just simply not enough.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:08:45):**  And so this is this becomes essential.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:08:49):**  But what I see, you know, those same the same kind of things that I've seen in helping to  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:08:53):**  start up city farms and community gardens in various places as well, it's that it's  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:08:58):**  that need to have that sense of belonging.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:09:03):**  Like even though they're displaced, they're in a land that's not their own, they have  
**[0:09:09-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:09:09):**  no sense of ownership or connection to that place.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:09:12):**  Some of them have actually been there for maybe 20 years.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:09:15):**  And so that even though they know that then it's not their place, that there is a sense  
**[0:09:20-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:09:20):**  of connection and they know people in that area and there's a sense of mutuality that  
**[0:09:30-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:09:30):**  unless they look after each other, there is really no one else.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:09:34):**  And so this sense that we saw this a lot, particularly during the lockdowns here in  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:09:39):**  Australia and in the bushfires and in the in the floods that are happening now, it's  
**[0:09:44-0:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:09:44):**  this local communities banding together and really identifying what are the what do we  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:09:50):**  actually need and who are the people who we can reach out to and support the most.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:09:55):**  So what I'm noticing in the in the refugee communities, for example, there's one particular  
**[0:10:00-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:10:00):**  man that I work with a lot.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:10:02):**  His name is Ben Maricki.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:10:04):**  And he he actually goes into the UNHCR and says, who are the people who are the most  
**[0:10:09-0:10:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:10:09):**  vulnerable people in this community that need this the most?  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:10:12):**  And they listed out like like a huge list of people who are refugees themselves, elderly  
**[0:10:19-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:10:19):**  people who are taking in foster kids, orphans who and so these communities of those people  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:10:27):**  are probably in the most needy that he he'd ever seen.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:10:32):**  And so he ran a program for them.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:10:34):**  And so this is kind of a little bit like what you see in in the kind of community garden  
**[0:10:38-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:10:38):**  model in Australia.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:10:39):**  It's saying, well, what is the need that we have in this community?  
**[0:10:42-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:10:42):**  Where are the people that need the help?  
**[0:10:44-0:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:10:44):**  What is the kind of help that they need?  
**[0:10:46-0:10:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:10:46):**  And really using that permaculture systems design approach, you know, and deeply connecting  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:10:53):**  with what's actually going on rather than coming in with a program.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:10:56):**  You know, he's told me so many times that there's been millions of dollars sent into  
**[0:11:01-0:11:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:11:01):**  these communities.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:11:02):**  But look around me like where is it gone?  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:11:05):**  I don't actually know where it's gone.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:11:08):**  Whereas when we come in with our we are the refugees.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:11:11):**  We know what the problems are.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:11:12):**  We know what the solutions are.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:11:15):**  We just need a little bit of a hand to get them started.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:11:19):**  And so that's kind of where our links have have come in as like telling the story of  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:11:24):**  what they're doing, what they need to the global permaculture community and just doing  
**[0:11:30-0:11:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:11:30):**  a crowdfunding.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:11:31):**  Basically, it's very simple model.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:11:34):**  And but 100 percent of what gets crowdfunded around the world gets sent directly into those  
**[0:11:39-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:11:39):**  communities.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:11:40):**  And I kind of noticed the similarity to in terms of how we got something like North Street  
**[0:11:46-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:11:46):**  City Farm in Brisbane that the grants that came in seem to control and determine the  
**[0:11:55-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:11:55):**  type of project that got set up.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:11:57):**  It was like the terms of reference were determined by a government program or an external program  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:12:03):**  that didn't actually necessarily meet what was going on on the ground.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:12:08):**  And so we ended up not taking those kind of grants and just speaking to the local community,  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:12:14):**  going up and down the street, going talking to local businesses, knocking on doors and  
**[0:12:19-0:12:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:12:19):**  saying, look, this is a community project.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:12:21):**  How can it serve your needs?  
**[0:12:23-0:12:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:12:23):**  And is there any way that you could support if you go like, oh, there's that old fence  
**[0:12:26-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:12:26):**  you got out the front there.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:12:28):**  Are you throwing that out?  
**[0:12:29-0:12:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:12:29):**  We'd love to use that.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:12:30):**  You know, like just finding resources and repurposing them.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:12:34):**  And so that's how the projects right in the middle of the cities in Australia got started.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:12:40):**  And it feels similar in that way.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:12:43):**  It's about the resilience and the robustness and just that that earnestness of of care  
**[0:12:50-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:12:50):**  and taking responsibility of the community that you're in.  
**[0:12:53-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:12:53):**  Now, I know that there's different scales within the whole refugee crisis and the kind  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:13:02):**  of refugees that I've been working with, particularly the refugee communities, are the ones that  
**[0:13:06-0:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:13:06):**  have been there for a little while.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:13:08):**  So it's not that kind of, you know, just arrived in the land.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:13:13):**  But having said that, what's happening now?  
**[0:13:16-0:13:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:13:16):**  You know, there's the Ukraine crisis happening right now.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:13:20):**  At the same time, I just got word that the crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:13:26):**  has amplified and there's thousands and thousands of people flocking over the border again.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:13:31):**  And these refugee settlements that are already crowded all the way across throughout East  
**[0:13:36-0:13:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:13:36):**  Africa are getting flooded with new people.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:13:39):**  What we're noticing now with people who have access to these permaculture skills and tools  
**[0:13:43-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:13:43):**  and resources and seeds and places to share will actually welcome them, welcome them in  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:13:52):**  and help to get them started and get them a little plot and get them going in meeting  
**[0:13:57-0:13:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:13:57):**  their basic needs.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:13:58):**  And so and then they ask us to help with that support.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:14:02):**  So the response is coming from within the community.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:14:05):**  And and that's kind of showing like a strength and a robustness.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:14:11):**  Like someone said to me the other day about the farmers here in Australia after the floods.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:14:17):**  Like we're not talking about resilience at the moment, because resilience is about being  
**[0:14:21-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:14:21):**  out of bounce back.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:14:22):**  Like we don't feel particularly bouncy right now.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:14:24):**  We just need to be really robust.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:14:26):**  We need to be just strong and deeply rooted, connected and supporting each other and just  
**[0:14:31-0:14:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:14:31):**  ground ourselves.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:14:33):**  And it feels like that's what's happening in these communities there.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:14:37):**  And it's it's kind of it's the enormity of the situation can become overwhelming.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:14:47):**  And I know when I first started working with these communities, how overwhelmed I felt  
**[0:14:54-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:14:54):**  like I'm not even making a drop in the ocean difference.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:15:00):**  But what you start to see, though, is the living nature of community and how something  
**[0:15:08-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:15:08):**  that it works well, my ciliates and what might seem like a drop in the ocean here, even make  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:15:15):**  sense if it's working, can ripple out across communities.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:15:20):**  And this is what's happening.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:15:21):**  And it's an absolutely extraordinary thing to take note of.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:15:26):**  And so what what is going on at the moment is that it's very rapid people teaching people,  
**[0:15:33-0:15:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:15:33):**  people helping others, people sharing their tools, their seeds, their resources, their  
**[0:15:39-0:15:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:15:39):**  land, running education programs for each other, setting up youth spaces, particularly  
**[0:15:43-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:15:43):**  youth spaces, seems to be youth spaces and spaces for women, spaces where people can  
**[0:15:50-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:15:50):**  just be and connect and.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:15:52):**  It's like this trauma that we could never even begin to understand in these places.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:15:59):**  And so having somewhere which has a sense of peace around a sense of living or that  
**[0:16:07-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:16:07):**  you can create, even if they go there and do no work, but just go there to be or go  
**[0:16:13-0:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:16:13):**  there to take care of the kids.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:16:15):**  It's different from sitting in a little hut in a hot, dry, dusty place.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:16:19):**  And so the gardens are important for that reason.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:16:23):**  But what I'm saying is that it's it's it's becoming viral because they're taking videos.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:16:31):**  So they've all got little they're taking videos, they're uploading them onto YouTube, they're  
**[0:16:34-0:16:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:16:34):**  making songs about it.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:16:36):**  So some of those, they're so lovely.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:16:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:16:39):**  You know, and and so, you know, one young man said to me, this is the difference.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:16:44):**  You know, this is this is what we need.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:16:46):**  This is going to help us to make a living.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:16:48):**  This is going to help us to eat.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:16:49):**  It's going to help us to stay healthy.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:16:50):**  But it's not rippling far enough.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:16:52):**  This has to go across all of our camps to all of our people fast.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:16:58):**  The only way it's going to get out is we sing it and we dance it like it has to become a  
**[0:17:02-0:17:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:17:02):**  cultural thing.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:17:03):**  And so I've learned so much in in working with these communities about the cultural  
**[0:17:09-0:17:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:17:09):**  aspect of permaculture, the permaculture.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:17:12):**  And and so to me, that seems to be something that's that's taken taken off.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:17:19):**  So in one camp it began.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:17:21):**  And then as they put up their songs, some of the other young people in other camps said,  
**[0:17:25-0:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:17:25):**  oh, that's what I want to do.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:17:26):**  So they're now writing songs, doing plays.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:17:28):**  We're just about to get a permaculture TV show happening that's doing kind of like theatre  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:17:35):**  and telling stories.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:17:37):**  There's children's books that are being written.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:17:39):**  There's all of these different sort of writing and songs.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:17:42):**  It was the slam poetry session not that long ago and a dance troupe that's forming.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:17:48):**  And all of this is just just happening because it it it's it's kind of that radical hope  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:17:56):**  thing of of bringing bringing through change, but also because it's something that can can  
**[0:18:02-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:18:02):**  help them access funds to support them in their daily life, get to go to school and  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:18:09):**  also connect them with a global community of friends.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:18:13):**  And so, you know, one of the things that we've been doing, too, is anyone who can with their  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:18:18):**  language or data, and we often help them with that, who can access out.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:18:22):**  We have an online permaculture educators program so they they can get into learning about doing  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:18:27):**  the permaculture design course or the permaculture teachers course.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:18:31):**  And so they can anyone who's in any of these camps can access this for free.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:18:36):**  So they become a full member of the whole global community that's learning to get to  
**[0:18:41-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:18:41):**  do all the design studios and share what they're doing.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:18:44):**  And it's this global community of practice, I think, that is helping so much to make the  
**[0:18:50-0:18:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:18:50):**  connections.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:18:51):**  So some people within the course who are sponsoring others to even get to university, there's  
**[0:18:57-0:19:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:18:57):**  some that are sponsoring like a well being put in somewhere.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:19:00):**  And it's this being part of a global community that, you know, you can imagine there's this  
**[0:19:06-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:19:06):**  place called Kakuma refugee settlement that Kakuma apparently means nowhere in Swahili.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:19:13):**  So there's nobody because they don't have land in nowhere land.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:19:18):**  And when all of a sudden you start to become part of this global community and people are  
**[0:19:22-0:19:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:19:22):**  checking in with you and saying, how's it going?  
**[0:19:24-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:19:24):**  And, you know, making sure that you're okay.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:19:27):**  And if you've got malaria or typhoid or, you know, COVID that there's someone that's reaching  
**[0:19:32-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:19:32):**  out to help and support you in that.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:19:34):**  So I think that's also a big part of the people care.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:19:39):**  You know, I used to start off by just saying, okay, we're just supporting the permaculture  
**[0:19:45-0:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:19:45):**  educators program.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:19:46):**  So the programs which helped to ripple this out.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:19:49):**  But then if one of those people who's leading that program, son or daughter is really, you  
**[0:19:56-0:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:19:56):**  know, really sick or someone else is falling off a motorbike and gash their leg open and  
**[0:20:02-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:20:02):**  they attending to them, then the project doesn't happen anyway.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:20:05):**  So the people care side of it expanded out beyond the permaculture thing exactly into  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:20:12):**  like, well, what's going on in the community and how can we help you tend to that?  
**[0:20:17-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:20:17):**  And so I think, you know, the thing that I really wanted to say with this is that what's  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:20:24):**  driving the programs that we're involved in is the communities themselves.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:20:30):**  So it's not coming in saying, okay, we have a program for you.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:20:33):**  This is going to help you.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:20:35):**  It's like, what do you need?  
**[0:20:37-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:20:37):**  And just listening.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:20:38):**  And so this is part of that open conversation that's going on and then connecting the dots.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:20:43):**  So there's now actually a whole network all throughout East Africa of all these young  
**[0:20:50-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:20:50):**  groups and they're talking to each other.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:20:52):**  So they have WhatsApp networks and they're doing, so they might've done a course in one  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:20:57):**  spot and then some of the people who kind of like the champions of that go with the  
**[0:21:01-0:21:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:21:01):**  teacher to train in the next spot.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:21:03):**  So they get to be apprentices and then all of them are sort of sharing their story, sharing  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:21:07):**  their music, this multi-camp collaborations in music, and that they stay in touch by these  
**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:21:13):**  networks and so the learning goes on.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:21:17):**  If there's something that gets stuck in, they always know where they can drop into and they  
**[0:21:20-0:21:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:21:20):**  can drop into the global community as well.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:21:23):**  Well, there's so many beautiful things that you mentioned that I'd like to unpack.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:21:27):**  And I think we should start with how one of these projects starts in the first place.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:21:32):**  Because you were talking about how perhaps there are sponsors or other people who are  
**[0:21:38-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:21:38):**  trying to support from outside and they come in with their own agendas and don't necessarily  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:21:41):**  listen to what the individual communities and the members there need for themselves.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:21:46):**  I'm wondering how you apply the principles of observation and interaction to understand  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:21:52):**  the unique situation and the needs of the place where you are, as well as how they want  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:21:57):**  to see it grow before starting a project.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:22:01):**  Well I think taking another principle of the small and slow solutions is probably the beginning  
**[0:22:08-0:22:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:22:08):**  point.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:22:09):**  And so when someone has reached out, we begin with a small project and get to know each  
**[0:22:18-0:22:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:22:18):**  other, get to find what are, like open up that thread of conversation, build the trust  
**[0:22:25-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:22:25):**  and build a flow.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:22:29):**  And through that to be identifying what are the needs and what are the issues that are  
**[0:22:35-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:22:35):**  being faced and what kind of help is actually needed and is there someone else within that  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:22:41):**  community and so starting just to open up.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:22:45):**  So a lot of what I'm doing is really just asking a whole lot of questions all the time.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:22:50):**  Not all in one go, but just that in conversation, oh, have you thought about this or what about  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:22:56):**  that or did you know that there's this group over here and just starting to try and help  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:23:02):**  create those connected threads.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:23:07):**  But the design of the project comes through them learning together.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:23:11):**  So for example, one of the, Benri Quijo was talking about before, for example, he does  
**[0:23:18-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:23:18):**  a lot of videos and so he will start to video a project or a class and he talks to the students  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:23:26):**  and he's mapping out what they're doing in the field and then he'll share that.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:23:30):**  And then other people see that and say, oh, this is just what we would love to see happening  
**[0:23:35-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:23:35):**  in our community.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:23:36):**  Can you come help us?  
**[0:23:37-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:23:37):**  So it's by invitation, not by going out.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:23:40):**  So it kind of goes that way around.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:23:45):**  And also if someone approaches me separately and they've seen it, I'll just send the request  
**[0:23:50-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:23:50):**  back into the community and we can sort of have an open conversation or I'll let them  
**[0:23:54-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:23:54):**  talk about it first.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:23:55):**  But I'm not interested in controlling this.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:23:59):**  It's completely led from the community.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:24:02):**  So they decide that, okay, this camp over here is ready.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:24:06):**  They've got a group of people who want to get going.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:24:08):**  And so we just help to fund them to get there.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:24:12):**  And if someone else from another camp is also interested, we'll fund them to come along  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:24:17):**  as well.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:24:18):**  So it's this three way, it's this buddying system and apprenticing.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:24:21):**  And then when they go around the next time, they'll go over to this person's place and  
**[0:24:25-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:24:25):**  bring someone from another place and a new person.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:24:27):**  And so it just keeps building and evolving in that way.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:24:32):**  And so really the small and slow solutions is the core part of it.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:24:40):**  And from my perspective, it is very much about the listening and the observation and the  
**[0:24:45-0:24:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:24:45):**  noticing and then talking that through with each other.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:24:49):**  I mean, one of the courses that happened when I mentioned that Bemarik used to talk to people  
**[0:24:56-0:24:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:24:56):**  about, well, who are the people most in need?  
**[0:24:59-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:24:59):**  And he was actually called into the office of prime minister at one point and who are  
**[0:25:06-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:25:06):**  the people who oversee the camps.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:25:08):**  And they said, and he was a bit worried.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:25:10):**  He texted me before, I said, I don't know what's going to happen.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:25:12):**  They might stop everything that we're doing because this is sort of not approved activity.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:25:17):**  I'm just doing this because I see that this needs to be done.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:25:21):**  He now just as an aside, he now has full support of the office of prime minister for doing  
**[0:25:27-0:25:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:25:27):**  this and has even been invited by them to run programs and set up kind of like pre-university  
**[0:25:34-0:25:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:25:34):**  courses for refugee youth to be able to then go forward.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:25:38):**  And so like accredited training type programs using permaculture, which is fantastic.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:25:44):**  So they called him into the office of prime minister and said, look, why is it that you're  
**[0:25:51-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:25:51):**  only ever doing this for refugees?  
**[0:25:53-0:25:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:25:53):**  Like, what about the host community?  
**[0:25:55-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:25:55):**  They need it too, because you've got to remember that when a whole lot of people come flooding  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:26:02):**  across the border and are settled in a place, that place was someone's place, you know,  
**[0:26:07-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:26:07):**  the host community that's there and very little attention ever gets paid to them as well,  
**[0:26:12-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:26:12):**  you know, and they're struggling.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:26:14):**  And so he said, sure, absolutely.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:26:16):**  Look, you know, that's really important.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:26:19):**  So he started to run a course.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:26:20):**  It was with the women from the host community and the women from the refugee community.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:26:27):**  And they'd never ever spoken to each other before.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:26:29):**  They're actually afraid of each other or judgmental of one another.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:26:33):**  Like it was just this separation.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:26:34):**  The kids wouldn't play.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:26:35):**  There's nothing, you know, they live side by side almost, but no connection.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:26:41):**  And so this course he created, you know, he created this space where there was this deep  
**[0:26:48-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:26:48):**  connection and respect built.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:26:50):**  And there's this film at the end where they're going, you know, we've learned a thousand  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:26:54):**  ways to love one another and we just don't want this to end.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:26:58):**  Like during the course they were going across and they were helping each other garden, they're  
**[0:27:01-0:27:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:27:01):**  helping each other cook, they were trading, all sorts of things.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:27:04):**  And then the, you know, the husband started to be invited in to meet one another and the  
**[0:27:09-0:27:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:27:09):**  children started to play.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:27:11):**  And simple thing as a permaculture course can do that to build bridges between communities  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:27:17):**  that had not spoken for 20 years and start to create opportunities for work and livelihoods  
**[0:27:23-0:27:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:27:23):**  on both sides, which I think is really important.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:27:26):**  So there's just so many different ways that it can begin, but it really does begin with  
**[0:27:33-0:27:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:27:33):**  that observation and that listening and noticing where are the places that the need seems to  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:27:40):**  calm most strongly.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:27:44):**  After that women's course was finished, one of the, there's a really interesting projects  
**[0:27:48-0:27:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:27:48):**  that set up, so they wanted to start to do business together.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:27:51):**  And so one of the projects was to set up a permaculture piggery.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:27:57):**  And so we were called upon to fund the first five pigs and they threw all their local resources,  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:28:04):**  built this beautiful natural piggery.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:28:08):**  And so the first five pigs went in there and now I think within a short space of time has  
**[0:28:13-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:28:13):**  been about 126 families that have benefited from the pigs.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:28:19):**  I keep getting these photographs of families taking home little pigs, so they get to eat,  
**[0:28:25-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:28:25):**  but they also take them home and breathe them up and then pass them on.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:28:28):**  So the whole idea is that the mother set, the father set, get passed on so they can  
**[0:28:36-0:28:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:28:36):**  start a whole new one.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:28:37):**  So it's about building that abundance.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:28:39):**  So it's not just about harvesting, it's about paying it forward and building up so that  
**[0:28:46-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:28:46):**  that local group has enough funds.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:28:49):**  So together they need to work to create the income.  
**[0:28:53-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:28:53):**  And once they have the income, that group can then fund individual exercises like businesses.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:29:00):**  What he said, he's noticed that when an experiment would come in to a refugee community, they'd  
**[0:29:05-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:29:05):**  say, okay, we'll give you all like the equivalent of a hundred bucks, go and start your business.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:29:08):**  He said, stuff happens, you know, like someone needs shoes, someone needs a pair of jeans  
**[0:29:15-0:29:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:29:15):**  or someone needs some food.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:29:17):**  The business will never get started.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:29:20):**  That was part of that millions of dollars has come in and nothing has happened.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:29:24):**  He said this way, we start a business together as a community and as a community, we design  
**[0:29:30-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:29:30):**  it, we make it happen and we all have responsibility to one another to make that happen.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:29:35):**  And then when it's working, we can help another community pay it forward and we can also help  
**[0:29:40-0:29:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:29:40):**  each other start our own businesses.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:29:41):**  And so it's definitely that community aspect of it, which he said is driving the success  
**[0:29:47-0:29:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:29:47):**  of them actually creating local enterprises.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:29:50):**  The same is happening with like community vegetable farms, seed saving networks.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:29:56):**  The current thing that's just happening right now is building up mushroom farms.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:30:00):**  And this is a particularly important thing because they've noticed with particularly  
**[0:30:06-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:30:06):**  with young babies that it really helps if they can have like powdered mushroom that  
**[0:30:11-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:30:11):**  will help build up nutrition and help to keep their babies healthier because, you know,  
**[0:30:16-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:30:16):**  there's still so much infant death and illness there and also to help with the lactating  
**[0:30:22-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:30:22):**  mothers.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:30:23):**  So, so the mushroom farm is happening right now.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:30:26):**  They've built this beautiful mud brick mushroom house with natural reeds on the top and they're  
**[0:30:32-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:30:32):**  just getting all that kitted out now.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:30:35):**  And another thing too is looking at how they can, we're just getting a briquette maker,  
**[0:30:40-0:30:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:30:40):**  like a hand pressed briquette maker to use community waste to make briquettes rather  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:30:46):**  than going around and chopping out trees and at the same time to trying to build food for  
**[0:30:51-0:30:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:30:51):**  us so that they can do the trimming.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:30:53):**  So there's like these multiple layers of community benefit.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:30:58):**  But for the first time, really, they're saying we're seeing the commons and planting the  
**[0:31:04-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:31:04):**  commons and doing common projects.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:31:07):**  And I think that that has been a really important part of their particular approach that the  
**[0:31:12-0:31:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:31:12):**  community is at the heart, which I can imagine is incredibly hard when it isn't your place.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:31:21):**  And there's many cultures and you're feeling not supported yourself in the first instance.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:31:26):**  But I think that's what I think, you know, what it's saying is that's all we really have.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:31:32):**  And so unless we nurture that, then the children growing up in this place will not have that  
**[0:31:40-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:31:40):**  to take forward with them.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:31:41):**  Like we grew up with it, we have a bit of a sense of it.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:31:44):**  But the kids who are growing up here need to feel into that.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:31:50):**  And I think this is Rosemary Morrow talks a lot about permaculture in refugee context  
**[0:31:54-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:31:54):**  because she says it's such an important skill.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:31:57):**  It helps the communities are there to redesign the places they're in so that they actually  
**[0:32:02-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:32:02):**  can eat well and live well and have access to fresh water and some kind of income.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:32:08):**  It helps if they get a chance to go back home because their homes are often destroyed and  
**[0:32:13-0:32:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:32:13):**  it gives them a chance to redesign, see that differently and redesign.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:32:17):**  And also if they get a chance to actually go somewhere else, then they have the skills  
**[0:32:21-0:32:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:32:21):**  to know how to look at a new place and to design that and to think forward into that.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:32:27):**  So I really like the way that she described that.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:32:29):**  I think, you know, more than, you know, because mostly if you see what happens in training  
**[0:32:34-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:32:34):**  in a refugee settlement, it'll be about technique.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:32:36):**  It'll be about how to set up a garden.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:32:39):**  And it's like, well, that might, you need the bigger picture.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:32:42):**  You need the design thinking.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:32:44):**  And I, you know, to be able to really feel into that sort of systems thinking.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:32:50):**  And I think this is also part of it, that bigger picture thinking, which really brings  
**[0:32:56-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:32:56):**  out that sense of hope and possibility and agency and like design thinking.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:33:05):**  Like spark something in you that, you know, like it's the possibilities lens, I guess.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:33:13):**  Like, oh, there is something possible.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:33:15):**  So like one of the young guys said to me once, he said, before we started doing this, he  
**[0:33:21-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:33:21):**  said, I was suicidal.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:33:22):**  Like there is absolutely, what do you do in a place like this as a young person?  
**[0:33:29-0:33:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:33:29):**  I don't see, I didn't see any hope, like anything to do.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:33:33):**  And you know, there's massive amounts of violence and abuse that goes on.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:33:41):**  And so finding these hubs of heart and possibility and joy in music and dance and sharing that  
**[0:33:53-0:33:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:33:53):**  with someone else.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:33:54):**  I mean, one of the things that he told me, this young man, he said, what turned it around  
**[0:33:58-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:33:58):**  for me was me realising that I could actually help someone else.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:34:03):**  I could help like the grandmothers.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:34:06):**  That made me feel like I had value, that I was an important member of this community,  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:34:10):**  that this was something really useful that I could do.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:34:15):**  And it just, you know, every day the stories like that, and you know, one of the things  
**[0:34:19-0:34:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:34:19):**  that I find hardest is how do we actually share this out as much as possible?  
**[0:34:23-0:34:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:34:23):**  You know, the stories that I hear every day are just incredible, but it's kind of hard  
**[0:34:29-0:34:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:34:29):**  to find a place to share the amount of amazing stories that keep generating.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:34:36):**  I don't know, I'd love to hear if you have any ideas for that because it's, you know,  
**[0:34:42-0:34:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:34:42):**  I can write it out, but there's a certain, I notice even in the social media posts that  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:34:49):**  I do about it, you know, I might post about what's going on in the refugee settlements  
**[0:34:54-0:34:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:34:54):**  and you know, like this is the number of views it gets.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:34:57):**  And then I might write about like a herb and like this is the amount of views you get.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:35:01):**  And so it's such a fickle kind of, I don't know, I don't know how to address that.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:35:08):**  But anyway, I just keep sharing the stories because I think what they're doing is incredible.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:35:14):**  So you're under the impression, or at least what you've seen from your statistics is that  
**[0:35:18-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:35:18):**  the posts that you're putting out, the information you're putting out about this type of work,  
**[0:35:23-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:35:23):**  especially from the refugee camps is getting far less activity and interest than perhaps  
**[0:35:29-0:35:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:35:29):**  technical information or design concepts.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:35:32):**  Yeah, I think so.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:35:34):**  And I think maybe it's because, I don't know, I mean, I think it's because there's so much  
**[0:35:43-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:35:43):**  going on in the world that, you know, maybe people just don't want to hear about things  
**[0:35:48-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:35:48):**  that's happening on the other side of the world.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:35:50):**  That's really challenging.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:35:52):**  You know, because when you think about why those wars happening, I mean, those wars are  
**[0:35:57-0:36:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:35:57):**  happening because of the process of colonisation, because of the ongoing mining for resources  
**[0:36:04-0:36:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:36:04):**  and the mining for those resources are the things that, you know, go into our technology.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:36:11):**  And how far do we want to really question what's at the root of these conflicts?  
**[0:36:16-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:36:16):**  And it's easier not to think about it, not to know about it and to, you know, and people  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:36:21):**  have also been struggling themselves with COVID, with floods, with fires, with everything  
**[0:36:27-0:36:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:36:27):**  that's going on in the world.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:36:29):**  And it becomes hard to sort of look out too far.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:36:33):**  Sure.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:36:34):**  We start to reach a personal capacity that we just can't take anymore.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:36:38):**  It's just not what we're looking for.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:36:40):**  And I feel that as well.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:36:41):**  I'm sure everyone reaches their threshold and it's just too much.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:36:45):**  But yeah, it's very important to make sure that we still pay attention to these communities  
**[0:36:50-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:36:50):**  that we are connected to, even if indirectly.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:36:52):**  Right.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:36:53):**  And I want to go back to something that you said before about the inspiration behind the  
**[0:36:57-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:36:57):**  possibilities in these design techniques that you are helping to facilitate.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:37:02):**  And I know from my own observations in both taking permaculture related courses and helping  
**[0:37:07-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:37:07):**  to facilitate them in different parts of the world, there is already such a rich existing  
**[0:37:13-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:37:13):**  knowledge of the land and cultivation techniques that there is to draw on.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:37:17):**  And if you start to bring in perhaps too strict of an idea of what these principles can be  
**[0:37:22-0:37:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:37:22):**  applied to do, it limits the possibilities for them to apply it and connect it with their  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:37:28):**  own knowledge that they I mean, especially in places like where you've been.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:37:32):**  There must be such a rich heritage that comes out as people connect with the design principles,  
**[0:37:38-0:37:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:37:38):**  but make it relevant to their own knowledge and history.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:37:41):**  What are some of the things that you've seen emerge from the con?  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:37:44):**  Yeah, the connection of those things.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:37:48):**  Well, I just want to say first before the sort of two different responses that I want  
**[0:37:55-0:38:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:37:55):**  to give to this one is that there has been such a long history of colonisation and oppression  
**[0:38:04-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:38:04):**  and not being connected to the land and being workers on other people's monoculture farms  
**[0:38:13-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:38:13):**  that a lot of the knowledge has dissipated a long time ago.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:38:21):**  And that is really, I was really surprised by the level of that and the amount of change  
**[0:38:30-0:38:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:38:30):**  that had happened also with the Green Revolution, how much shift had happened in people's mind  
**[0:38:37-0:38:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:38:37):**  about what was good farming and what was a good way to move forward.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:38:44):**  On the other side of that, there is this fiercely proud focus on plants and medicine and cultural  
**[0:38:55-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:38:55):**  heritage at the same time.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:38:57):**  But it seems to be like it's a small pocket and it seems to be growing and finding voice.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:39:02):**  And so that part and also things like how to prepare foods, different types of food.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:39:07):**  So what's coming through strongly is the cooking side or different ways of storing food.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:39:14):**  So how do you prepare and store food?  
**[0:39:17-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:39:17):**  So instead of just getting the GMO corn that's imported from somewhere else, how can you  
**[0:39:22-0:39:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:39:22):**  actually grow and store and process all the different kinds of things?  
**[0:39:26-0:39:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:39:26):**  So we're seeing films that are sharing about the storage, even how you store seeds in earthen  
**[0:39:35-0:39:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:39:35):**  pots that you can make or how you process the cassava and how you do all these different  
**[0:39:41-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:39:41):**  things with plants.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:39:42):**  And so that has been really amazing.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:39:43):**  And also the knowledge about plants for medicine, what plant you have for addressing typhoid  
**[0:39:51-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:39:51):**  or children's issues and women's issues.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:39:54):**  But the problem that they were facing was that they didn't have the space for the gardens  
**[0:39:59-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:39:59):**  or they didn't have the climate because they were in a different place.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:40:03):**  So if you'd come from Democratic Republic of Congo and you landed up in the deserts  
**[0:40:06-0:40:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:40:06):**  of Takana up in the top of, it wasn't the right place.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:40:11):**  And so you tried the things that you knew, but they weren't working.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:40:14):**  So it's about trying to take that traditional knowledge and apply the lens of design thinking  
**[0:40:23-0:40:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:40:23):**  to reapply that somehow in the local context.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:40:27):**  And so both that erosion of confidence in tradition and also the actual knowledge of  
**[0:40:36-0:40:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:40:36):**  it at the same time as finding those fractions, that is what the role of these courses is  
**[0:40:45-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:40:45):**  doing.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:40:46):**  And weaving that in local languages, bringing in local songs, bringing in local illustrations  
**[0:40:54-0:40:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:40:54):**  to describe them.  
**[0:40:55-0:41:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:40:55):**  Because if you go and share out like a permaculture book, and it's just filled with white faces,  
**[0:41:01-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:41:01):**  with temperate gardens, what does that mean?  
**[0:41:04-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:41:04):**  If you get that in a refugee zone, it doesn't really relate to you, like these big houses  
**[0:41:10-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:41:10):**  with zone one, two, three, four, five around them.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:41:12):**  It doesn't make any sense.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:41:14):**  So you need to kind of adapt it and localise it.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:41:17):**  And that's one of the other projects that we're really working to support is there's  
**[0:41:21-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:41:21):**  a whole group of young illustrators and storytellers who are retelling permaculture through their  
**[0:41:27-0:41:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:41:27):**  refugee lens and redrawing that.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:41:33):**  Sure.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:41:34):**  Now, despite the association of poverty and a lack of resources in communities like this,  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:41:41):**  I'm sure you've observed richness in social capital, intellectual, spiritual, and these  
**[0:41:46-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:41:46):**  other forms of capital that have a lot of value, especially when they can be applied  
**[0:41:50-0:41:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:41:50):**  through a design lens like you teach.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:41:52):**  How have you seen or helped to leverage these sources of richness to overcome some of the  
**[0:41:59-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:41:59):**  deficits in financial or material resources that are needed to get a project off the ground?  
**[0:42:06-0:42:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:42:06):**  One of the things I think that is most helpful is that if someone gets something, it tends  
**[0:42:13-0:42:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:42:13):**  to be for everyone.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:42:15):**  You know, like, you know, I've got this project, like everyone comes in and shares in it.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:42:21):**  So you can't actually give money to one person.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:42:24):**  If you give money to one person or a project, it becomes everyone's.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:42:28):**  And so that community approach right there and the idea of, yeah, I mean, I think that's  
**[0:42:38-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:42:38):**  it.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:42:39):**  I mean, I think that's the core.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:42:40):**  It's not about me, it's about we.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:42:42):**  And that feels so much easier somehow and more well developed in that context.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:42:48):**  And I think that, you know, from all the other examples that I've been sharing, that comes  
**[0:42:53-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:42:53):**  through so much in collaborating to do the seeds and the nurseries and the food forests,  
**[0:43:00-0:43:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:43:00):**  the collective space and reimagining the commons in places where that hasn't existed.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:43:06):**  Because they don't know if they're ever going to get home again.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:43:09):**  And so all they have is that social capital.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:43:12):**  Like, they don't have physical capital at all.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:43:16):**  And the lessons from that have been quite extraordinary for me and also all the groups  
**[0:43:22-0:43:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:43:22):**  that are kind of meeting up with them.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:43:24):**  I mean, one of the things that, you know, I wanted to mention before, too, was that  
**[0:43:30-0:43:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:43:30):**  through the connection with this global community, the lessons that they're learning are being  
**[0:43:36-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:43:36):**  shared out the other way.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:43:37):**  So it's not just this one way flow.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:43:39):**  I've actually noticed that many of the most inspirational moments in many of the courses  
**[0:43:45-0:43:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:43:45):**  and sessions that have been run is coming from the sharing of those people who've ended  
**[0:43:52-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:43:52):**  up in these refugee communities.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:43:54):**  And so, you know, one of the things, too, that I think is important to keep in mind  
**[0:43:58-0:44:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:43:58):**  and it's hard to not slip into it.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:44:01):**  You know, you're saying, okay, I might be someone who's displaced from my community,  
**[0:44:07-0:44:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:44:07):**  but don't always just call me a refugee.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:44:09):**  Like, my name is Paulina or my name is John or my name is Sakina.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:44:14):**  And I am, you know, from this place and I am, you know, this is me.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:44:19):**  And I am because it's so easy to kind of objectify them as sort of like this group of suffering  
**[0:44:26-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:44:26):**  people, whereas they all come with, you know, all their, you know, dreams and hopes and  
**[0:44:35-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:44:35):**  families and all their contextualities and to really engage just not as someone who's  
**[0:44:45-0:44:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:44:45):**  going in to be a saviour, but just to connect.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:44:48):**  And I think this possibility of connection and one thing that makes it work is that it's  
**[0:44:53-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:44:53):**  a relationship that so it's not like going, okay, well, let's fund these people.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:44:58):**  So I talked about the lack of people caring about it.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:45:00):**  The only way that I found that people care about this is they have a friendship with  
**[0:45:04-0:45:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:45:04):**  them.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:45:05):**  So we create as many opportunities as possible where people can actually meet and talk and  
**[0:45:12-0:45:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:45:12):**  laugh and listen to their music and share stories about families, like just be human  
**[0:45:17-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:45:17):**  together.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:45:18):**  And, you know, I can't begin to think how it would be possible without even that sense  
**[0:45:25-0:45:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:45:25):**  of connection.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:45:26):**  And then that opens up our minds to think, oh, what's happening in my local community?  
**[0:45:30-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:45:30):**  Who are the refugees in my community or who are the people that are struggling and starts  
**[0:45:34-0:45:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:45:34):**  to open?  
**[0:45:35-0:45:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:45:35):**  Like it's a bit of a crack in the door of our hearts somehow to think, oh, like, let  
**[0:45:39-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:45:39):**  me just see beyond my own backyard, my own reality or my little neighbourhood to think  
**[0:45:45-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:45:45):**  like we thrive when we all thrive.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:45:48):**  I'm curious too, what are some of the things that you've learned from these experiences  
**[0:45:52-0:45:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:45:52):**  working with refugee communities that you've applied to so much of your other work as an  
**[0:45:56-0:45:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:45:56):**  educator and a facilitator around the world?  
**[0:45:58-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:45:58):**  Oh, gosh, that's a big question.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:46:02):**  Well, in terms of how I run my work, that is always a very strong gift economy that  
**[0:46:14-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:46:14):**  runs throughout it.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:46:15):**  So at least every time someone signs up for a course of mine, at least another person  
**[0:46:21-0:46:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:46:21):**  or more has access to it for free.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:46:24):**  So there's always this, so it's kind of like this social enterprise that works and that's  
**[0:46:30-0:46:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:46:30):**  how it runs.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:46:31):**  I've set up, so I have an ecology of organisations.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:46:34):**  So there's the Permaculture Education Institute and there's the Perma Youth.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:46:38):**  So this is this global network of young people connecting around permaculture and these young  
**[0:46:43-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:46:43):**  people are connecting from Australia to the camps to India to all over.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:46:49):**  So that's another part.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:46:51):**  And then there's the Ethos Foundation, which is a registered charity.  
**[0:46:54-0:46:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:46:54):**  And that's where any of the funds that are collected come into there.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:46:58):**  And then I send 100% across to those communities and last year we were able to raise enough  
**[0:47:03-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:47:03):**  funds to support about 1500 young people to complete their permaculture design certificate  
**[0:47:10-0:47:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:47:10):**  courses and start up permaculture demonstration centres where learning can take place, where  
**[0:47:16-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:47:16):**  seed banks can be created.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:47:18):**  And with this music, one of the things like, so now this first band that I don't know if  
**[0:47:23-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:47:23):**  you heard the ones from Kakamu Refugee, that music has got out on radio around the world  
**[0:47:32-0:47:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:47:32):**  and it got into the ears of the Grateful Deads Foundation.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:47:37):**  And I hadn't heard about their foundation.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:47:40):**  I didn't even approach them, but in the end, they've now helped them to construct a music  
**[0:47:46-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:47:46):**  studio.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:47:47):**  So it's a mud brick solar powered music studio that is also a permaculture learning centre.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:47:52):**  And it's a place that's going to be where they're going to make permaculture music and  
**[0:47:55-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:47:55):**  other music and run a permaculture radio show.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:47:59):**  And then the story of that has got out.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:48:01):**  So now there's these little permaculture music studios starting to pop up in different places  
**[0:48:06-0:48:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:48:06):**  as well.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:48:10):**  I think what I'm learning a lot about is being in conversation, sharing stories, to be more  
**[0:48:17-0:48:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:48:17):**  of a storyteller rather than an instructor, to be able to listen and notice what is working  
**[0:48:24-0:48:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:48:24):**  in a particular context and culture and help people to redefine what permaculture means  
**[0:48:31-0:48:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:48:31):**  in their space, rather than trying to deliver what I think it is.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:48:36):**  Because it only means that much to me and to my context.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:48:44):**  And also to connect people in this global community and to acknowledge that we're all  
**[0:48:49-0:48:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:48:49):**  working together.  
**[0:48:51-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:48:51):**  We may only be a drop where we are, like I said before, but when we start to notice that  
**[0:48:57-0:49:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:48:57):**  all of these drops are part of this whole network, and it kind of feels like a flip  
**[0:49:02-0:49:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:49:02):**  of the power in some ways.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:49:06):**  Because you think of it's what's going on underneath the ground.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:49:09):**  It's not seen that much necessarily in conventional society, but it pops up as beautiful mushrooms  
**[0:49:14-0:49:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:49:14):**  in different places and nourishing.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:49:16):**  The more compost we put on it in different places, the more it's going to keep growing.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:49:22):**  So it's that.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:49:23):**  It's that.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:49:24):**  And feeling that the possibility is there, even despite everything that's going up on  
**[0:49:29-0:49:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:49:29):**  the top, that if we focus on keeping on composting and nourishing and tending to the micro, to  
**[0:49:37-0:49:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:49:37):**  the bacterial level of what's going on, that we can create that robustness.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:49:42):**  That if a crisis happens somewhere, that there is the support nearby that can help to recolonise  
**[0:49:49-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:49:49):**  that area.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:49:50):**  It's like when you're gardening, you don't completely empty out a whole garden.  
**[0:49:55-0:50:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:49:55):**  You leave the perennials in so they can help to recolonise a bit that's been disturbed.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:50:00):**  And the same kind of thing happens in community, as long as there's enough going on around.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:50:05):**  And so really seeing that working and seeing the possibilities of what can happen with  
**[0:50:14-0:50:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:50:14):**  just that storytelling and the connection, it's incredibly empowering to those who are  
**[0:50:22-0:50:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:50:22):**  involved in it and uplifting for new people who come to permaculture and then think, oh,  
**[0:50:28-0:50:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:50:28):**  I just thought it was about backyard gardening.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:50:30):**  And what I'm seeing is I can actually be connected to this global network and feel like I'm here,  
**[0:50:37-0:50:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:50:37):**  but everything that I do here is actually helping us to have this one planet way of  
**[0:50:42-0:50:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:50:42):**  life and contributing to the future.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:50:45):**  And I think that is really important to help to paint that bigger picture.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:50:50):**  Oh, for sure.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:50:52):**  And I would imagine too, as you've facilitated and been a part of so many of these projects,  
**[0:50:56-0:51:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:50:56):**  you've probably started to notice some of the patterns of elements that are either present  
**[0:51:01-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:51:01):**  or missing in the ones that succeed and take off and myceliate and those that falter and  
**[0:51:07-0:51:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:51:07):**  start to lose steam.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:51:10):**  What are some of the ones that have contributed to the more successful projects and are noticeably  
**[0:51:17-0:51:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:51:17):**  present in many of those that have continued and grown?  
**[0:51:21-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:51:21):**  Well, I think it comes back to the thing that you mentioned right at the start is the community  
**[0:51:26-0:51:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:51:26):**  that it's not about a leader taking control of a project and trying to drive it.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:51:36):**  Someone described it to me as saying that I'm only a leader if I have as many people  
**[0:51:44-0:51:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:51:44):**  with me leading too and that part of what I'm doing is trying to cultivate that leadership.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:51:50):**  And so there's this sense of people working together so that there's never just one person  
**[0:51:54-0:51:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:51:54):**  driving it.  
**[0:51:55-0:52:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:51:55):**  There's a collective that's working together and constantly bringing in new people and  
**[0:52:00-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:52:00):**  buddying them up.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:52:01):**  And so it's the outreach work.  
**[0:52:05-0:52:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:52:05):**  It's the demonstration work.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:52:06):**  It's the thinking beyond even like obviously beyond your backyard, but beyond your neighbourhood  
**[0:52:16-0:52:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:52:16):**  and even beyond your region into thinking, well, how does this connect with someone else?  
**[0:52:21-0:52:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:52:21):**  And if someone calls for help for that to be sharing that out, it's like they're paying  
**[0:52:27-0:52:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:52:27):**  it forward.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:52:28):**  So when it comes in the other way around and there's like someone leading and it seems  
**[0:52:32-0:52:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:52:32):**  to be everything sucked into that central point that it just kind of ends up kind of  
**[0:52:37-0:52:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:52:37):**  imploding after a while.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:52:39):**  Whereas when it's kind of like it builds the abundance and that feels like where the strength  
**[0:52:47-0:52:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:52:47):**  is.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:52:48):**  It's the community and the community and that happens by the way in which it's communicated  
**[0:52:54-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:52:54):**  in the storytelling, in the possibilities lens.  
**[0:52:58-0:53:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:52:58):**  And so I mean, I've said that before, but I just think that is kind of like for me,  
**[0:53:01-0:53:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:53:01):**  that is what makes it work when they share.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:53:04):**  This is what happened in our community and this is how you do it.  
**[0:53:08-0:53:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:53:08):**  And the music goes out, the instructions go out, the difference, showing the difference,  
**[0:53:16-0:53:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:53:16):**  showing the before and after, showing it in video, showing it in photographs, talking  
**[0:53:22-0:53:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:53:22):**  it, creating circles, safe spaces where that can happen.  
**[0:53:26-0:53:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:53:26):**  And so I think it's in the type of leadership and also in making sure that it can happen  
**[0:53:33-0:53:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:53:33):**  with like on the smell of a naughty rag, that it's not something that needs a massive amount  
**[0:53:38-0:53:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:53:38):**  of money.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:53:39):**  It sends me an application for $80,000 for a project, but I know over here, someone else  
**[0:53:46-0:53:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:53:46):**  has just asked for $1,000 for the same thing.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:53:49):**  Like where is the $79,000 difference?  
**[0:53:52-0:53:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:53:52):**  There's something that's going on in that project.  
**[0:53:55-0:54:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:53:55):**  So it's that starting small and then building it up and becoming a self-generating system.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:54:01):**  So really thinking about how to not to develop dependence, but to enable a self-generating  
**[0:54:11-0:54:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:54:11):**  system to emerge.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:54:13):**  And it's that flipping the model of support.  
**[0:54:17-0:54:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:54:17):**  Certainly.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:54:19):**  And so with all of this potential and all of these inspiring ideas and testimonies from  
**[0:54:25-0:54:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:54:25):**  what you've seen in these communities, we're still in a cycle of displacement of people  
**[0:54:32-0:54:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:54:32):**  for conflict reasons, for climate emergency reasons, all sorts of disasters that are contributing  
**[0:54:40-0:54:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:54:40):**  to the displacement of people all over the world.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:54:42):**  And it does not seem to be subsiding.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:54:44):**  I'm wondering what your vision of what you would like to see realized in the way of how  
**[0:54:49-0:54:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:54:49):**  the world treats and invests in refugee populations around the world.  
**[0:54:53-0:54:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:54:53):**  What sort of policies or changes in consciousness would be required for that to happen?  
**[0:54:59-0:55:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:54:59):**  Because this is not going to subside anytime soon.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:55:02):**  Great question.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:55:07):**  You know, I think, for example, there's one place down in just outside of where I live  
**[0:55:14-0:55:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:55:14):**  in these sort of one in a thousand year flood zone.  
**[0:55:18-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:55:18):**  And the community is leading this sort of role in helping community.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:55:26):**  And so it's about creating commons where people can land safely.  
**[0:55:35-0:55:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:55:35):**  And so this commons is a place where people can build temporary housing safely.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:55:41):**  People can grow food safely.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:55:43):**  So where are we actually thinking about what is the possibilities of having good quality  
**[0:55:52-0:56:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:55:52):**  housing, public food spaces in urban areas, places where people can very quickly access  
**[0:56:02-0:56:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:56:02):**  a little piece of land and some tools and some seeds.  
**[0:56:06-0:56:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:56:06):**  I remember actually going and talking a long time ago with some people in Cuba and Havana  
**[0:56:12-0:56:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:56:12):**  and they were saying, you know, one of the things that's made a difference, like if we  
**[0:56:16-0:56:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:56:16):**  need to, we can go to our government and say, we need some land, some seeds and some tools  
**[0:56:21-0:56:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:56:21):**  so we can actually grow some food.  
**[0:56:24-0:56:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:56:24):**  And that was provided in the so-called special period there that that was something that  
**[0:56:29-0:56:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:56:29):**  was available.  
**[0:56:31-0:56:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:56:31):**  We need to acknowledge that we are in a global special period now and this focus on not just  
**[0:56:38-0:56:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:56:38):**  delivering aid food, being like surplus food that is not nourishing food, but actually  
**[0:56:47-0:56:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:56:47):**  creating the spaces where people can grow it.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:56:50):**  At the same time, though, you know, like there's a difference between the emergency needs and  
**[0:56:57-0:56:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:56:57):**  the longer term refugees.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:56:59):**  If you know you're going to be in a place for a while before you can go back home or  
**[0:57:03-0:57:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:57:03):**  settle, you need to have a space, but if it's a temporary one and you're in trauma, there's  
**[0:57:08-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:57:08):**  probably not much that you want.  
**[0:57:10-0:57:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:57:10):**  You're probably not going to want to start growing food right then and there.  
**[0:57:13-0:57:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:57:13):**  So there's different things.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:57:15):**  But if you have community food forests, like spaces that are grown where people can access  
**[0:57:23-0:57:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:57:23):**  food, there are so many people now here in Australia, I don't know what it's like where  
**[0:57:27-0:57:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:57:27):**  you are, but the homelessness is going through the roof.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:57:31):**  And this is here in Australia.  
**[0:57:32-0:57:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:57:32):**  We're not even talking about, you know, African refugee communities at the moment.  
**[0:57:38-0:57:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:57:38):**  Where are those people accessing shelter?  
**[0:57:40-0:57:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:57:40):**  Where are those people accessing a place to shower and go to the bathroom?  
**[0:57:46-0:57:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:57:46):**  Where are they getting their food from?  
**[0:57:48-0:57:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:57:48):**  So having emergency housing, emergency food, community food systems set up, I think that's  
**[0:57:58-0:58:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:57:58):**  kind of like a key thing and that we start to build into our urban planning a process  
**[0:58:06-0:58:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:58:06):**  of imagining that we have farms and food systems embedded throughout.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:58:11):**  There's some examples from Denmark that I think are absolutely brilliant where, I don't  
**[0:58:16-0:58:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:58:16):**  know if you've ever come across the places, the kind of cohousing communities just outside  
**[0:58:22-0:58:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:58:22):**  of Copenhagen, where the middle part of the subdivision is actually a farm.  
**[0:58:29-0:58:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:58:29):**  And so the best part of the land was set out as a farm and all of the wastewater and the  
**[0:58:36-0:58:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:58:36):**  nutrients came down.  
**[0:58:37-0:58:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:58:37):**  So if you could create sort of rapidly developed urban farm type tiny house villages, where  
**[0:58:45-0:58:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:58:45):**  you have a farm in the middle with houses around the edge, the wastewater coming down  
**[0:58:49-0:58:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:58:49):**  into the farm, the nutrients collected and fed to the farm.  
**[0:58:53-0:59:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:58:53):**  So these kind of like rapidly developed ecovillage models that can be turned into emergency housing  
**[0:59:01-0:59:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:59:01):**  doesn't take a lot of effort to set up, doesn't take a lot of time either.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:59:08):**  The models exist and I think possibly it's time for us as designers to be having this  
**[0:59:17-0:59:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:59:17):**  conversation with emergency groups.  
**[0:59:21-0:59:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:59:21):**  There is a group called Re-Alliance and also Regenerosity and Permaculture for Refugees,  
**[0:59:28-0:59:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:59:28):**  organizations that are high level thinkers, people who are actually already in aid agencies  
**[0:59:38-0:59:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:59:38):**  or in the UN who are taking permaculture directly into the heart of it.  
**[0:59:43-0:59:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:59:43):**  And people like Natalie Topa and Warren Brush as well, who are really focusing on this work  
**[0:59:50-0:59:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:59:50):**  and have brilliant systems set up.  
**[0:59:54-0:59:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:59:54):**  Something that Natalie Topa and Warren Brush have been setting up recently called Sponge  
**[0:59:58-1:00:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=0:59:58):**  Village.  
**[1:00:00-1:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:00:00):**  It's actually looking at the whole landscape of an area and thinking about that of how  
**[1:00:05-1:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:00:05):**  you can soak in the water so that you have the possibility for food and the possibility  
**[1:00:10-1:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:00:10):**  for managing the floods and the droughts at the same time.  
**[1:00:18-1:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:00:18):**  I am seeing actually permaculture concepts and ideas going in already, but these techniques  
**[1:00:27-1:00:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:00:27):**  need to be amplified.  
**[1:00:28-1:00:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:00:28):**  We need films about it.  
**[1:00:30-1:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:00:30):**  We need the documentation of it more.  
**[1:00:33-1:00:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:00:33):**  We need the reporting of it more widely shared out.  
**[1:00:38-1:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:00:38):**  And so I think it comes back to that, that we value and we share out what we know already.  
**[1:00:45-1:00:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:00:45):**  We have decades of this experience.  
**[1:00:48-1:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:00:48):**  It feels like now is the time that anyone who has experience in this needs to be sort  
**[1:00:52-1:00:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:00:52):**  of stepping up and speaking up and going to any kind of possible place that we have the  
**[1:00:58-1:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:00:58):**  capacity to speak at to do that, whether it be universities, councils, governments, UN.  
**[1:01:04-1:01:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:01:04):**  There are so many skills that I think now is the time for us all to be speaking up and  
**[1:01:09-1:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:01:09):**  stepping up as much as we possibly can.  
**[1:01:13-1:01:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:01:13):**  Very well said.  
**[1:01:14-1:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:01:14):**  And on that note, what advice would you give to people who are feeling called to do this  
**[1:01:18-1:01:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:01:18):**  type of work, either abroad or within their own communities?  
**[1:01:21-1:01:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:01:21):**  Because as you mentioned too, internal displacement is increasing.  
**[1:01:25-1:01:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:01:25):**  And I mean, maybe not so much as I've noticed here in Spain, but certainly in the United  
**[1:01:30-1:01:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:01:30):**  States, the homeless populations and such, economic refugees, like we mentioned, this  
**[1:01:35-1:01:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:01:35):**  is going to continue.  
**[1:01:36-1:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:01:36):**  And so we need everybody's hands on deck.  
**[1:01:38-1:01:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:01:38):**  What advice would you give to people to get started and to tool up so that they can be  
**[1:01:43-1:01:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:01:43):**  effective?  
**[1:01:44-1:01:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:01:44):**  I think the first thing to do would be obviously to be practicing.  
**[1:01:50-1:01:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:01:50):**  Like if you're doing it yourself and you're understanding how it works in your local community,  
**[1:01:55-1:02:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:01:55):**  then you're able to maybe distribute your surplus, put something out on the front, making  
**[1:02:01-1:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:02:01):**  sure that anything that you'd like, plan a garden in the front yard and put like, please  
**[1:02:05-1:02:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:02:05):**  feel free to harvest or take your harvest down to the local shelter or start with that  
**[1:02:11-1:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:02:11):**  local community.  
**[1:02:13-1:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:02:13):**  And then once you start to connect with that local community of need, possibly you might  
**[1:02:17-1:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:02:17):**  identify that there's other groups that you can support and start to connect as well.  
**[1:02:22-1:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:02:22):**  So it's not to sort of jump out to here, but like myceliate your skills and your networks  
**[1:02:29-1:02:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:02:29):**  at the same time.  
**[1:02:31-1:02:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:02:31):**  If you feel like there's something that you'd like to reach out further, like I would highly  
**[1:02:37-1:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:02:37):**  recommend connecting in with those people who already have those relationships and work  
**[1:02:42-1:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:02:42):**  with that network of relationships, rather than just kind of like jumping straight in.  
**[1:02:47-1:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:02:47):**  It takes time.  
**[1:02:49-1:02:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:02:49):**  It really takes time to feel into that and it can be really easy to jump in and kind  
**[1:02:56-1:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:02:56):**  of make lots of mistakes as well.  
**[1:02:59-1:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:02:59):**  And so that starts more, start from where you are, start from what really makes you  
**[1:03:08-1:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:03:08):**  feel upset.  
**[1:03:11-1:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:03:11):**  What are you feeling that is wrong?  
**[1:03:16-1:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:03:16):**  What are you feeling is that really moves you into that state of like either feeling  
**[1:03:22-1:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:03:22):**  angry or afraid or overwhelmed or fearful and to approach that as being, because that's  
**[1:03:27-1:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:03:27):**  the thing that you'll have the energy to put towards.  
**[1:03:31-1:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:03:31):**  And there is no one or one particular direction that we all need to be heading.  
**[1:03:37-1:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:03:37):**  We need everyone to be doing something about something that they care about and then sharing  
**[1:03:42-1:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:03:42):**  that story with other people.  
**[1:03:44-1:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:03:44):**  So as you're having, invite people over for dinner, Eva, and just share the story about  
**[1:03:51-1:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:03:51):**  what it is that you're doing to make a difference.  
**[1:03:54-1:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:03:54):**  And maybe someone might be really inspired by that who then go and do something else  
**[1:03:57-1:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:03:57):**  over here, who then talks to the leader of the school department who will say, let's  
**[1:04:04-1:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:04:04):**  do this in all the schools.  
**[1:04:05-1:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:04:05):**  I mean, this happened in the refugee settlement recently.  
**[1:04:08-1:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:04:08):**  One young man ran a small permaculture workshop for a group of young people.  
**[1:04:13-1:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:04:13):**  One of the young women in that happened, her uncle happened to be the head of all of the  
**[1:04:17-1:04:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:04:17):**  schools throughout all of the refugee settlements in Tanzania.  
**[1:04:21-1:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:04:21):**  And so now there's a permaculture project for all the schools throughout all the refugee  
**[1:04:27-1:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:04:27):**  settlements in Tanzania.  
**[1:04:28-1:04:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:04:28):**  It was as simple as that.  
**[1:04:29-1:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:04:29):**  It's like starting small with what you know what to do.  
**[1:04:32-1:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:04:32):**  And before you know it, if it's good, if it makes sense, it will naturally spread.  
**[1:04:38-1:04:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:04:38):**  Absolutely.  
**[1:04:39-1:04:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:04:39):**  Man, what a fantastic message to put out to people and I hope that this can get the word  
**[1:04:44-1:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:04:44):**  out further and facilitate in helping further stories and knowledge as well.  
**[1:04:49-1:04:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/morag-gamble-on-hope-for-regeneration-in-refugee-communities/#t=1:04:49):**  Morag, thank you so much for taking the time today.

**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:01:04):**  Back then I was working mostly in natural building, designing homes, and managing construction  
**[0:01:08-0:01:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:01:08):**  sites for friends and clients around Lake Atiplan.

**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:01:16):**  after years of searching and planning, we're now preparing to move to a new property later  
**[0:01:20-0:01:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:01:20):**  this year in the Catalan mountains.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:01:22):**  Yet through all of these changes, my fascination for the knowledge and the stories of the folks  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:01:27):**  around the world who are working to regenerate this planet and their communities has only  
**[0:01:32-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:01:32):**  grown.

**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:01:43):**  that I've come to value in my professional work, as well as the path that I'll be taking  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:01:47):**  to move into our new property and design the place to accomplish the personal, financial,  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:01:52):**  and community goals that my partner and I have set out for ourselves.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:01:56):**  I've also been listening keenly to the valuable feedback and ideas that have been coming up  
**[0:02:00-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:02:00):**  in the Discord channel.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:02:02):**  Many of you there have voiced a clear interest in hearing more in-depth and long-form interviews,

**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:02:10):**  So to start off this season, I'll be doing a deep dive into the design process from some  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:02:14):**  of the most renowned permaculture and regenerative project planners that I know.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:02:19):**  Because all of you are coming from different contexts and resource bases, I'm going to  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:02:22):**  approach this topic from different angles.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:02:25):**  In this first session, I spoke with Rob Avis from Verge Permaculture.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:02:30):**  For 12 years now, he and his wife Michelle, along with a growing team of designers, have  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:02:34):**  been elevating professional design in Canada and have written and produced professional  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:02:39):**  resources and educational content in order to make permaculture and environmental design  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:02:43):**  learning accessible to as many people as possible.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:02:47):**  Since launching Verge, Rob has helped more than 5,000 students and a growing number of  
**[0:02:52-0:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:02:52):**  clients to design and or create integrated systems for shelter, energy, water, waste,  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:02:58):**  and food, all while supporting local economies and regenerating the land.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:03:03):**  In 2019, Rob moved to a 65 hectare wooded property in central Alberta, Canada, and now  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:03:10):**  spends most of his free time building his own permaculture property.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:03:14):**  In this session, we covered a lot of ground but focused on the design process specifically  
**[0:03:19-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:03:19):**  for small and residential scale projects.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:03:22):**  We talk about the differences in the process at small scales and the advantages and disadvantages  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:03:27):**  of that space limitation.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:03:30):**  Rob shares a lot of his personal learnings from being a designer and educator over a  
**[0:03:33-0:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:03:33):**  decade and the aspects of learning and the observation process that he's expanded because  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:03:40):**  it's been useful or he now breezes past because it's not as useful.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:03:44):**  We also spend some focused time talking about the opportunities outside of just growing  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:03:49):**  food that he sees in making a living and building businesses through the application of permaculture  
**[0:03:54-0:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:03:54):**  training.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:03:55):**  Now be sure to stick around all the way till the end where Rob gives a sneak peek at the  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:03:59):**  new blockchain project that he's launching this year with the co-founders of the Ethereum  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:04:04):**  cryptocurrency, all with the goal of regenerating the planet by the year 2049.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:04:10):**  Rob brilliantly mixes a deep and philosophical understanding of earth care and environmental  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:04:15):**  patterns with a practical and focused approach of a career engineer.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:04:19):**  You'll really want to take the time in this one to hear it all the way through.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:04:22):**  So with that said, I'll hand things over now to Rob Avis.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:04:27):**  It's been a while since we chatted last time and we've both made some big moves here on  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:04:31):**  a new property and you've got a new book out.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:04:34):**  I spoke with Dakota like I mentioned before and we kind of had started working through  
**[0:04:38-0:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:04:38):**  some of the chapters of this book.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:04:40):**  And one of the things that I know that you have a lot of experience with, I've talked  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:04:43):**  about endlessly on videos and in the courses that you run is how to get started in the  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:04:49):**  design process, mostly just about any scale because the patterns repeat themselves even  
**[0:04:55-0:04:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:04:55):**  as you go larger or smaller.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:04:58):**  But having already talked with Dakota about the necessity of getting clear about your  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:05:04):**  goals and your vision, and especially since permaculture properties can be so many things,  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:05:10):**  but the clarity of what you want out of the end result can be a big factor that guides  
**[0:05:15-0:05:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:05:15):**  the design.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:05:16):**  What are some of the most common long-term goals and big visions that your clients and  
**[0:05:20-0:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:05:20):**  your students come to you with?  
**[0:05:22-0:05:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:05:22):**  You see patterns in that as well?  
**[0:05:24-0:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:05:24):**  Yeah, it's interesting.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:05:26):**  I mean, we go through the process of kind of getting clear on their vision and values  
**[0:05:33-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:05:33):**  and I feel like that's becoming part of the kind of permaculture process now.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:05:40):**  It was probably one of the weaker parts in the design, the permaculture design course  
**[0:05:46-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:05:46):**  that Bill came up with.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:05:49):**  And through various other influences like holistic management and the Savory Institute  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:05:55):**  or Savory Hub, those influences have started to permeate into permaculture.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:06:01):**  And so that's what you and Dakota were talking about.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:06:03):**  And if you don't, I mean, the quote that we can summarize that whole section with is,  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:06:09):**  if one does not know to which port one is sailing, then no wind is a good wind.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:06:14):**  And so in sailing, our weather systems move around in circles.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:06:17):**  And if you're saying yes to everything, you'll end up going in circles.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:06:23):**  And so that's the sailing analogy.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:06:25):**  But when we look at the design of a property, small or large, especially with the kind of  
**[0:06:30-0:06:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:06:30):**  interconnected systems that we strive toward in permaculture, there's a lot of details,  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:06:38):**  there's lots of connections.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:06:41):**  And we have the power of placement in permaculture, but we don't have the power of conductivity.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:06:46):**  And so sometimes we'll place two systems together and they won't connect and our designs will  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:06:53):**  not work.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:06:54):**  And that's just a form of feedback.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:06:57):**  And so what's interesting about values and vision is that we all fundamentally pretty  
**[0:07:02-0:07:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:07:02):**  much want the same thing.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:07:04):**  And we have different words that we use that resonate with us to kind of get there.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:07:08):**  And the thing that we're all after on planet earth, unless you're psychopathic, is wellbeing.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:07:15):**  And when you teach somebody a permaculture design course, they kind of glaze over the  
**[0:07:23-0:07:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:07:23):**  wellbeing piece.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:07:24):**  They think, well, I need a rocket mass heater, I need a food forest, I need a garden or a  
**[0:07:27-0:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:07:27):**  rain tank or whatever.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:07:29):**  And it's really important to get to the why.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:07:32):**  And so in that first stage, what we're trying to help people to do is to allow them to get  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:07:39):**  to their own insight that the reason that you're doing all this work to build a permaculture  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:07:43):**  system is to enhance wellbeing.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:07:47):**  And it's not just to enhance your wellbeing, it's to enhance the wellbeing of future generations,  
**[0:07:51-0:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:07:51):**  because we are self-interested individuals, but we have enlightened self-interest.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:07:59):**  And what I mean by that is that if you were just purely self-interested, you might not  
**[0:08:04-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:08:04):**  care too much about future generations, but we have this selfish gene inside of us that  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:08:12):**  wants to make sure that our kin are going to be well taken care of as well.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:08:16):**  And so it's important to us to know that what we're doing is also going to create wellbeing  
**[0:08:20-0:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:08:20):**  for them.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:08:21):**  And then if you expand that, fractal that out just a little bit more, you recognize  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:08:25):**  that the best way to give wellbeing to your kin and even to yourself is to make sure the  
**[0:08:30-0:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:08:30):**  people around you are in good shape as well.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:08:33):**  And so that's the whole function of the values and vision is to really get clear why.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:08:37):**  It's not because you want a food forest, it's because you want the products that that food  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:08:41):**  forest or the wellbeing that that food forest is going to give to you.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:08:45):**  And it's really important that people have those insights.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:08:48):**  It's easy for us to tell people that, but until that thing has clicked in their head,  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:08:53):**  you know, it's, it's just some other consultant telling them something.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:08:57):**  The other thing that, and I think this is probably going to be my biggest insight for  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:09:02):**  the last 14 years of teaching permaculture is that you can't teach design.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:09:08):**  It's not possible.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:09:10):**  In fact, design is innate.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:09:13):**  Like to be human is to design.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:09:16):**  And and so it's like, Masim Taleb has this analogy in his book, Antifragile.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:09:24):**  And he says, imagine you're a professor and you've got a classroom sitting in front of  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:09:31):**  you and you walk into class one day and you're a physics professor, actually specialize in  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:09:37):**  aerodynamics and you walk into class one day and you bring in a bird cage and there's a  
**[0:09:41-0:09:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:09:41):**  bird inside of it.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:09:42):**  And you say, okay, class, I'm going to teach this bird how to fly.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:09:48):**  And so he turns around at the chalkboard and he starts putting all the theorems up and  
**[0:09:53-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:09:53):**  explaining the Bernoulli principle, which by the way, we still don't even know what  
**[0:09:56-0:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:09:56):**  flying is because of the Bernoulli principle.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:09:59):**  We're still figuring that out.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:10:01):**  It's a very empirical thing flying.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:10:03):**  Most people don't realize that when they're in an airplane, they're relying entirely on  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:10:06):**  empirical observations and not a really true understanding of what's going on up there.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:10:10):**  But we have a good sense of it.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:10:11):**  It's just we don't know exactly what's going on.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:10:14):**  And so he goes through all these theorems and and for two hours explains to this bird  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:10:18):**  the principles of flight.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:10:20):**  And then he opens the door up and the bird steps out and flies.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:10:23):**  And he's like, see, I told you that I could teach this bird how to fly.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:10:28):**  And and so that bird knew how to fly.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:10:30):**  It was genetically part of its being.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:10:32):**  It's part of the survival mechanism.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:10:34):**  And my argument is that humans have that same innate programming.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:10:39):**  It's not to fly, but to design.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:10:41):**  And probably everybody on this call that's listening has an experience where they've  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:10:47):**  gone into somebody's house or to somebody's property and they think, man, why is the kitchen  
**[0:10:52-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:10:52):**  laid out this way or why did they place that thing that that picnic table on their property  
**[0:10:59-0:11:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:10:59):**  over there or that food forest in that location?  
**[0:11:01-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:11:01):**  Or it just doesn't make any sense.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:11:03):**  And maybe it doesn't make sense to them, but it might have made sense to the person that  
**[0:11:06-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:11:06):**  put it there.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:11:07):**  So that's your analytical brain kind of operating on automatic, figuring out kind of where things  
**[0:11:15-0:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:11:15):**  go.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:11:16):**  And so that's that's an innate ability.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:11:17):**  What we need to teach as permaculture teachers and also what we need to do as consultants  
**[0:11:23-0:11:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:11:23):**  when we're going in and designing any property, small and large, is often the thing that that  
**[0:11:30-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:11:30):**  we spend the least amount of time on.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:11:32):**  And probably my second biggest insight over the last 14 years has been that 80 to 90 percent  
**[0:11:40-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:11:40):**  of the solution on any property, on any design, solving any problem, no matter if it's a personal  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:11:49):**  problem or a landscape problem or a building science problem or a renewable energy problem,  
**[0:11:55-0:11:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:11:55):**  is in the diagnosis.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:11:57):**  And so when we're and so you ask, like, what are some of the patterns that are typical  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:12:05):**  from small to large projects is people don't spend enough time diagnosing.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:12:10):**  And most of the solution exists within there.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:12:13):**  And so if we think about and I'll let you jump in, because I'm sure you want to say  
**[0:12:17-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:12:17):**  some stuff there about that.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:12:18):**  But if we think about a property as a Venn diagram and so the first imagine the first  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:12:24):**  bubble in the Venn diagram is this gigantic circle.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:12:29):**  And that gigantic circle is I call it the sum of possibilities.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:12:34):**  And it's super overwhelming because it's almost like unlimited possibilities.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:12:38):**  This is a giant circle.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:12:39):**  So somebody, small or large property goes onto this property and they just look at it  
**[0:12:44-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:12:44):**  like, oh, my gosh, I'm just how am I going to solve this problem?  
**[0:12:47-0:12:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:12:47):**  It's just there's so many possibilities here.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:12:50):**  And then you get your values and vision piece.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:12:52):**  And that's another bubble.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:12:53):**  It sits that's nested inside of the big bubble.  
**[0:12:57-0:12:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:12:57):**  OK, so that's one set of constraints.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:12:58):**  It's like, well, now all of a sudden, all of those infinite possibilities that you thought  
**[0:13:02-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:13:02):**  existed don't because only a certain number of them exist within what your values and  
**[0:13:07-0:13:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:13:07):**  vision want.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:13:09):**  And then we're going to bring another bubble in, which is what the property wants to be.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:13:15):**  And so in permaculture, we look at patterns in ecosystems, patterns of human existence.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:13:22):**  And we understand what the intrinsic we try to understand what the intrinsic desires and  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:13:31):**  characteristics of those systems, humans or ecosystems or buildings, whatever.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:13:36):**  And then you look for an intersection between your values and vision and that property.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:13:43):**  And there may or may not be an intersection that you may have bought the wrong property.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:13:46):**  And so they don't intersect.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:13:47):**  Or maybe you have brought the property and there's now a sliver that exists between your  
**[0:13:51-0:13:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:13:51):**  values and vision and what your property wants to be.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:13:55):**  And then we bring a third bubble in, which is your resources.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:13:57):**  And we use Ethan Roland and Gregory Landyose concept of eight forms of capital.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:14:03):**  And we look at the capital you've got access to.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:14:06):**  And then we fit that bubble into and hopefully there's the right resources to you know, that  
**[0:14:11-0:14:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:14:11):**  will allow you to intersect those other two bubbles.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:14:13):**  And now all of a sudden we went from this infinite possibility down to this tiny little  
**[0:14:17-0:14:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:14:17):**  sliver of possibility that exists, which takes away all the complexity and all everything  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:14:24):**  that I did there, which was understanding the patterns of landscape, understanding the  
**[0:14:28-0:14:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:14:28):**  patterns of the mind and creating a more holistic balance sheet of your resources and trying  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:14:34):**  to figure out where the synergies exist between those three things.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:14:38):**  And now I took this really complex problem and I simplified it down to this tiny little  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:14:42):**  sliver of opportunity.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:14:45):**  And I did all of that through diagnosis.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:14:49):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:14:51):**  And I think you've made a lot of good points there.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:14:53):**  It's kind of hard to think where to go back and to start.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:14:56):**  I really agree with that observation that design is something that is inherent to us.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:15:01):**  And I hadn't heard it articulated that way, but it made immediate sense from my own observations  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:15:05):**  as well in teaching.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:15:07):**  We're constantly altering our living environment, the things that we interact with in order  
**[0:15:12-0:15:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:15:12):**  for them to be more accessible, more easy to interact with, or whatever the criteria  
**[0:15:18-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:15:18):**  someone is looking through.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:15:19):**  I know a lot of people do through ways that I wouldn't myself through aesthetics or different  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:15:25):**  priorities, but that gathering information in order to be able to diagnose, to limit  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:15:30):**  the options so that one can make a decision.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:15:33):**  Otherwise that's really where that overwhelm comes from.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:15:36):**  That does seem to be the area where you can have the most influence on changing these  
**[0:15:40-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:15:40):**  patterns of thinking instead of seeing a massive picture with a whole bunch of disjointed pieces  
**[0:15:46-0:15:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:15:46):**  and infinite options into based on what you have access to with your own resources.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:15:52):**  And like you said, those overlapping Venn diagrams are the things that pertain to you,  
**[0:15:56-0:16:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:15:56):**  your context, and also all these other factors that are unique to the person who's designing  
**[0:16:04-0:16:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:16:04):**  the place, all of those elements that can be taught.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:16:07):**  That can be something that people can learn to see through observation, through data collection.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:16:12):**  And that's really that second part of your book.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:16:16):**  That being said, there are still a huge amount of aspects of data collection and things that  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:16:23):**  are often very foreign to people who are new to this concept in order to wrap their heads  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:16:28):**  around or to learn where to find this information or at what time of the year.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:16:32):**  And that part in itself can be very overwhelming.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:16:35):**  It's a lot of new information, and I'm sure you've seen you can go down the rabbit hole  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:16:39):**  in a lot of them into the minute details all the way down to the minerals inside of your  
**[0:16:43-0:16:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:16:43):**  soil.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:16:44):**  And so in order to further narrow it down and take the overwhelm out of that step, what  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:16:50):**  are some of the priority things that you have, especially new people to look into if they're  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:16:55):**  designing something, say, for a home scale project?  
**[0:16:59-0:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:16:59):**  So one of the amazing things about partnering with nature is that, and this is another piece  
**[0:17:07-0:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:17:07):**  that people get drawn down into, and it ends up in this kind of, I don't want to say downward  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:17:15):**  spiral, but basically a misdirected focus is maybe a better way of putting it.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:17:20):**  But we definitely leverage a lot of the insights that P.A.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:17:24):**  Yeomans came up with the scale of permanence.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:17:27):**  It was a really brilliant piece of thinking that he did, and we've modified it to be our  
**[0:17:31-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:17:31):**  own.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:17:32):**  We've changed the order of some stuff, but more or less it follows a very similar pattern.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:17:38):**  And so one of the kind of the most detailed pieces in the scale of permanence is the understanding  
**[0:17:47-0:17:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:17:47):**  of soil.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:17:48):**  And so you can get drawn down these rabbit holes trying to understand how much sand,  
**[0:17:53-0:17:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:17:53):**  how much silt, how much clay?  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:17:55):**  It's the microbial characteristics of your soil.  
**[0:17:57-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:17:57):**  How much carbon does it have?  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:17:59):**  And those are kind of important to a point, but it's interesting to note that soil is  
**[0:18:04-0:18:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:18:04):**  last on the list.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:18:06):**  It's the last element that we even think about.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:18:07):**  In fact, I almost never think about the soil.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:18:12):**  And some people might be cursing me as I say this right now, but there's not enough sand,  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:18:18):**  silt and clay or enough fossil fuels for that matter to move sand, silt and clay around  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:18:23):**  planet Earth to create the perfect loam that every gardener wants.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:18:28):**  And so you're kind of stuck with what you got.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:18:33):**  But the good news is, is that when you partner with nature, she's been stuck with what she's  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:18:37):**  had for billions of years, and she's figured out how to work with it.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:18:42):**  And so the scale of permanence is really brilliant because it really helps to hone in on what  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:18:48):**  the most important components are to focus on first, second, third and fourth.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:18:53):**  And sometimes you'll manipulate them a little bit.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:18:56):**  We don't think about the scale of permanence or our order of operations as we refer to  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:19:01):**  it in our book as a dogmatic thing.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:19:05):**  Because sometimes you're going to buy a property, for example, to have structures on it already.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:19:08):**  You're buying a property with a house and a garage and the greenhouse or whatever, those  
**[0:19:13-0:19:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:19:13):**  might not be movable in any kind of economic way.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:19:16):**  And so, you know, water access structures, which is a lot in school thing, if you kind  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:19:23):**  of scale that up now with the scale of permanence is actually climate, geography, water access  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:19:29):**  structures, flora, fauna, fencing, technology, business and soil.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:19:35):**  And so you may move those elements around based upon what already exists on your property.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:19:41):**  And that's all right.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:19:42):**  But this is just a guideline.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:19:44):**  And so when we start off at the very top of that scale of permanence in our diagnosis,  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:19:52):**  the reason climate and geography are up there first is that they're almost impossible to  
**[0:19:57-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:19:57):**  manipulate.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:19:58):**  And so, you know, you're kind of stuck with the ring that you've got.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:20:03):**  What's really cool about our climate in the north here is that we actually have a huge  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:20:08):**  ability to influence the amount of water we have access to because of snow.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:20:12):**  And snow is the only maybe snow and humidity are kind of secret, I don't know, Jedi moves  
**[0:20:26-0:20:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:20:26):**  that permaculturists can use because we can put up snow fences and we can put up humidity  
**[0:20:32-0:20:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:20:32):**  fences that remove humidity from the air similar to the redwoods and similar to forests, actually.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:20:39):**  But you're kind of stuck with what you got.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:20:42):**  And, you know, if if chemtrails actually exist, you know, it's only going to be available  
**[0:20:48-0:20:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:20:48):**  to a very select few group of people.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:20:51):**  And I'm talking about weather modification.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:20:52):**  Actually, that doesn't exist.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:20:54):**  We have weather modification here in Alberta, they actually spray the skies with a silver  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:20:59):**  compound to reduce hails.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:21:01):**  So we know that some degree of it is possible.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:21:05):**  How far out that goes, I don't know.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:21:08):**  And I don't spend any time thinking about it really, because it's out of my I try to  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:21:12):**  live my life with this understanding of sphere of influence and spirit concern.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:21:16):**  And I try not to spend too much time in the sphere of concern side.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:21:19):**  And so if I have no influence over, I don't put a lot of my mental energy into it.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:21:24):**  Just as an aside, in case people start thinking that I'm a chemtrailer.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:21:28):**  But basically, we're kind of stuck with what we got geographically and climatically, unless  
**[0:21:37-0:21:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:21:37):**  we're willing to leave and move.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:21:39):**  And, and so those are what we call formative forces.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:21:42):**  They're formative, because they have direct influence on all the factors below.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:21:46):**  And so we can kind of simplify permaculture design, while we're talking about this down  
**[0:21:50-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:21:50):**  in a couple of easy statements for people.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:21:52):**  And I say this in our permaculture design course.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:21:56):**  Every element on your landscape either wants water or doesn't want it, or there can be  
**[0:22:01-0:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:22:01):**  great versions of that as well.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:22:02):**  Some some might want certain amounts of water, we'll say so.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:22:06):**  And so every element can kind of be delineated based upon where it sits on that spectrum  
**[0:22:11-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:22:11):**  of designer and water.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:22:13):**  And and then every element on your landscape either is dehydrating or rehydrating.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:22:22):**  So a roof is a dehydrating element.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:22:27):**  And then if it's a dehydrating element, it's an opportunity to harvest water.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:22:30):**  And then, you know, a rain garden or a swell would be a rehydrating element.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:22:36):**  And so if you understand that everything kind of fits into these two spectrums, and you  
**[0:22:41-0:22:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:22:41):**  can work through a scale of permanence in high a diagnosed, what's your rainfall?  
**[0:22:46-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:22:46):**  What's your snowfall?  
**[0:22:47-0:22:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:22:47):**  What Where does your wind come from?  
**[0:22:48-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:22:48):**  Kind of the key Toby Hemingway used to say that the sectors that we talked about in permaculture  
**[0:22:55-0:22:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:22:55):**  are kind of the trump cards.  
**[0:22:57-0:22:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:22:57):**  And they always have to come first.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:22:59):**  That's part of that diagnosis piece, because it's so hard to manipulate the climatic variables  
**[0:23:04-0:23:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:23:04):**  on your property.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:23:06):**  And so once you understand those formative forces, if you can get the first three things  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:23:10):**  right, so geography, climate, and water, water is the first element where we actually have  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:23:16):**  the ability to kind of bend the rules a little bit, we don't want to break them, but we can  
**[0:23:20-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:23:20):**  bend them a little bit.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:23:22):**  And then that has cascading benefits, because once you know how the water is going to work  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:23:26):**  on your property, there's really only one or two places you can put a house on most  
**[0:23:31-0:23:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:23:31):**  properties, especially if it's a small property, if once we get into bigger properties, you  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:23:34):**  might have two or three locations after the water piece, but then you get to access and  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:23:39):**  it's like, well, what's the county where are they going to allow access onto your farm?  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:23:45):**  Or on a smaller property, there's probably going to be setbacks.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:23:47):**  And so the municipalities can determine what your setbacks are going to be to your borders.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:23:52):**  So now all of a sudden, and then what are your resources.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:23:55):**  So if your resources don't allow you to build a five kilometer road into your property,  
**[0:24:00-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:24:00):**  you're going to put your house pretty close to the main access point.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:24:03):**  And so now we've taken that two or three locations that were good based upon water, and we've  
**[0:24:08-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:24:08):**  narrowed it down to probably one.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:24:11):**  So access has done that.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:24:12):**  And then we get to structures.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:24:14):**  And so structures are well, we need a house and needs to be bioregionally, you know, representative  
**[0:24:18-0:24:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:24:18):**  of what makes sense here.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:24:21):**  And so that are you in a cold climate or even subtropics in the tropics in the desert.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:24:26):**  And if you've done your water piece and your access piece first, and you have a good sense  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:24:32):**  of the resources on the land, because you've probably done some analysis based on the geography  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:24:38):**  component, you know, whether you're going to be building like, let's say you find clay,  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:24:42):**  for example, as a result of doing your water harvesting piece, and you live in the prairies  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:24:47):**  like I do, it's like, well, now, straw bale houses are really great appropriate technology.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:24:53):**  And we know that because I've got access to straw from around me, and I've got clay on  
**[0:24:56-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:24:56):**  my site.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:24:57):**  And probably I have sand there somewhere if I dig long enough and find it.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:25:01):**  So design actually, is not something we do coming back to what we're talking about earlier,  
**[0:25:06-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:25:06):**  it's something that emerges out of the woodwork as we find little tidbits of information,  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:25:14):**  we refer to those kind of like using to labs languages, black swans, and every property  
**[0:25:19-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:25:19):**  has a few of these black swans, and when you see them, it fundamentally shifts everything  
**[0:25:24-0:25:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:25:24):**  about that property.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:25:25):**  Yeah, I really like that emerging design.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:25:28):**  As a further elaboration, what we were talking about before, as you start to put all the  
**[0:25:32-0:25:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:25:32):**  pieces together and gather the essential information, what is almost removed from possibility is  
**[0:25:37-0:25:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:25:37):**  the design that's left, right.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:25:40):**  And I'm also curious as to how you came up with some of the additions and amendments  
**[0:25:44-0:25:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:25:44):**  to the scale of permanence that you were talking about.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:25:47):**  I know you've got on yours the the flora fauna, and then business and technology towards the  
**[0:25:53-0:25:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:25:53):**  end and I've worked with a bunch of people who have made their own adaptations, Dave  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:25:57):**  Jackie and Eric Tonesmeyer added one that I use a lot, which is invisible structures,  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:26:02):**  which you referenced as regulations, which is often a very much determining factor, especially  
**[0:26:07-0:26:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:26:07):**  in hyper regulated areas, like where both of us live.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:26:13):**  And I'm also working with Darren Dougherty and the Rugrarian's platform that has expanded  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:26:18):**  it to a 10 point scale of permanence adaptation.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:26:22):**  And I can only assume that you've added these in because you've found a lot of utility in  
**[0:26:26-0:26:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:26:26):**  them as you go through this cycle.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:26:28):**  Quite often, how do you interpret the flora fauna and then business and technology elements?  
**[0:26:34-0:26:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:26:34):**  And how have you found them useful in the design process?  
**[0:26:38-0:26:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:26:38):**  So in our climate, livestock is a really important component of what it means to have a regenerative  
**[0:26:45-0:26:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:26:45):**  food system.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:26:47):**  And a lot of times, the livestock that we want to integrate into our landscapes are  
**[0:26:52-0:26:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:26:52):**  going to want to compete with the other food products that we're going to grow.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:26:57):**  And so fencing comes next.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:27:02):**  And so we have to fence our areas for access or for basically segregating certain activities  
**[0:27:09-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:27:09):**  or behaviors.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:27:10):**  And so we have the fencing set up, we can't really go and plant anything.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:27:17):**  And so our fencing design is going to help to protect basically our plantings.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:27:24):**  So either it'll limit the amount of grazing that goes on, it'll keep the goats out of  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:27:29):**  the food forest or out of the garden.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:27:33):**  And so fencing comes before flora in terms of how we design.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:27:38):**  And the thing is, I think this is really important, actually.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:27:43):**  We use a scale of permanence as a set of training wheels.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:27:47):**  I think that's really important for people to realize.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:27:49):**  And so people go back and get the book or read some of our blogs or videos and they  
**[0:27:54-0:27:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:27:54):**  say, wow, you have to do this, this, this and this.  
**[0:27:57-0:27:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:27:57):**  Well, not really.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:27:59):**  This is, Dan Palmer is working on his own kind of design process.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:28:07):**  And he's really big on this concept of holistic design.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:28:15):**  And in that design is not a linear process.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:28:19):**  And I couldn't agree with him more.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:28:22):**  And I think one of his criticisms of our book was that, that we kind of made this out to  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:28:26):**  be a very linear process, step one, two, three, four, five, and then the scale of permanence,  
**[0:28:31-0:28:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:28:31):**  you know, going all through these different elements.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:28:34):**  And somebody could get the book and kind of interpret it that way.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:28:39):**  But we're pretty clear in the book when we say that if it's the first time designing  
**[0:28:44-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:28:44):**  or it's your 10th time designing, there's probably going to be a benefit of having a  
**[0:28:49-0:28:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:28:49):**  sequential process to follow.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:28:52):**  But once you're at your 100th or 200th design, and you know, you're not, your brain doesn't  
**[0:28:58-0:29:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:28:58):**  work in sequential processing, it's a parallel processing unit.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:29:04):**  There are limitations to our prefrontal cortex, but I'm sure you've had the experience where  
**[0:29:10-0:29:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:29:10):**  you go to bed with a problem, you wake up with a solution.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:29:13):**  And so there is parallel processing going on in the back.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:29:16):**  It's just not conscious all the time.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:29:19):**  And so, however, we do live in a temporal paradigm that, that means that one second  
**[0:29:28-0:29:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:29:28):**  comes after another.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:29:29):**  And there's not at least my, I haven't figured out how to tap into parallel universes yet.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:29:33):**  And so when I'm teaching something to somebody, I still teach it in a linear fashion, because  
**[0:29:40-0:29:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:29:40):**  before you can learn to run, you have to learn to walk.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:29:43):**  And before you can learn to walk, you have to learn how to crawl.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:29:46):**  And so I want to just put that down there because, you know, if you do follow this process,  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:29:52):**  we actually want you to make the process your own too.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:29:55):**  And you might have a better sequence or organization than we've even come up with based upon your  
**[0:29:59-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:29:59):**  context and where you where you're living in the world.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:30:02):**  This is just how it's evolved for us.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:30:05):**  When we go onto a property, sequencing is really important in how we think about design,  
**[0:30:11-0:30:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:30:11):**  but also how we, we implement installation as well.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:30:17):**  And and so it really does follow the same principles as PA Yeomans.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:30:23):**  So part of it is like, what's the right sequence in the design process?  
**[0:30:28-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:30:28):**  But also, you know, what is this, what is how rapidly can you change some of these things  
**[0:30:35-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:30:35):**  once they get installed?  
**[0:30:37-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:30:37):**  And so we want to make sure that we get that order of operations right.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:30:41):**  And so business and technology, for example, are things that can can change relatively  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:30:45):**  quickly relative to compared to a tree or compared to the climate.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:30:51):**  A business might only last two years, it might last five, it might last 30.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:30:55):**  It's still a very short period of time when we're thinking in terms of biological time  
**[0:30:59-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:30:59):**  scales.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:31:02):**  And so we've just and we've changed this list number of times too, as we work through it.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:31:06):**  And this is our latest revision.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:31:07):**  And I hold the right to change it at any time in the future if we have more insights.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:31:15):**  Yeah, and this is why I really like talking to you.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:31:18):**  And those of you who've worked at Verge Permaculture is that you have kept very good records of  
**[0:31:22-0:31:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:31:22):**  the evolution of how you've taught and adapted your teaching methods over time.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:31:28):**  And actually, this is something that I'm working on, as I redo some of the online courses that  
**[0:31:33-0:31:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:31:33):**  I've had out through different distributors in the past, and I'm starting to like, bring  
**[0:31:37-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:31:37):**  things and consolidate them together, revamp them a little bit with some of that experience.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:31:41):**  And then also think about who the audience is, whether it's going to be farmers this  
**[0:31:45-0:31:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:31:45):**  time, or if it's going to be, you know, people working on small home scale projects again,  
**[0:31:49-0:31:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:31:49):**  or if it's something bigger, and sometimes even applying some of the same concepts of  
**[0:31:53-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:31:53):**  things like business.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:31:56):**  With all of the things that are relevant to creating this emergent design, what are some  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:32:03):**  of the ones that perhaps you hear everybody harping on kind of like getting to know your  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:32:07):**  soil like you mentioned before that you've sort of gloss over at this point, because  
**[0:32:12-0:32:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:32:12):**  you don't see a real need, especially not to focus on the details of it when you're  
**[0:32:15-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:32:15):**  just starting when you've got your training wheels, like you mentioned, and perhaps what  
**[0:32:19-0:32:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:32:19):**  are some of the ones that are glossed over by others that you found are actually really  
**[0:32:24-0:32:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:32:24):**  important, especially when you're learning it?  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:32:26):**  Hmm, I'll give that some thought. I mean, I'll talk a little bit more about the soil,  
**[0:32:32-0:32:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:32:32):**  because there's some insights there.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:32:38):**  We didn't just, you know, make a haphazard decision to ignore the soil.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:32:46):**  And so when we first started really ramping up our consulting, we spent a lot of our clients'  
**[0:32:52-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:32:52):**  money getting soil samples.  
**[0:32:55-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:32:55):**  We sent them to different labs, we had different protocols done.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:33:00):**  But we also, one of Dakota's areas of brilliance was, you know, as a farmer and farmers are  
**[0:33:07-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:33:07):**  very practical people.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:33:09):**  And, you know, they have very limited budgets, profit margins on farms are really low.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:33:13):**  And so they always come up with innovative ways, just purely out of necessity.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:33:20):**  He is the mother of invention. And so he came up with this idea of a visual soil inspection  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:33:27):**  that he could repeat over and over again that required a shovel, a coat hanger, a bucket  
**[0:33:32-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:33:32):**  with the bottom cut off of it, and a couple of other little bits and bobs.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:33:36):**  I think we typically carry an infrared temperature monitor with us.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:33:42):**  And so that kind of encompasses the holistic management bullseye, some infiltration, a  
**[0:33:49-0:33:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:33:49):**  quick inspection of the arthropods, or the larger insects or bugs that are present.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:33:58):**  Sometimes we'll do a pH test.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:34:00):**  But basically, when we looked, when we go onto a property, this is a really actually  
**[0:34:07-0:34:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:34:07):**  important thing if you're gonna if you're designing a property right now.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:34:14):**  Saying that we ignore the soil is actually not totally true.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:34:17):**  We just we pay attention to it in very specific ways.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:34:20):**  And one of the best things that you can do when you're getting started, and you're going  
**[0:34:26-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:34:26):**  onto a property, there's a few little tips and tricks we can give to you guys for diagnosis.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:34:32):**  One of which is we walk the property around the outside, and we try and understand where  
**[0:34:35-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:34:35):**  all the water flows are coming onto the property and coming off the property.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:34:39):**  So in the same way on a roof on a house, you want to know where the water is coming from  
**[0:34:42-0:34:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:34:42):**  and where it's going to.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:34:43):**  And your job as a permaculture designer is to come up with innovative ways to intercept  
**[0:34:47-0:34:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:34:47):**  that slow and store it.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:34:48):**  That's number one.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:34:50):**  Number two, and this comes back to the soil is I look for the worst place on the property.  
**[0:34:56-0:34:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:34:56):**  And I look for the best place on the property.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:34:59):**  So what is the part of that ecosystem that we have control over on this land?  
**[0:35:04-0:35:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:35:04):**  If you don't have a good place on the property, then I'll look for other properties in the  
**[0:35:08-0:35:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:35:08):**  vicinity that have a intact ecosystem that I can go and explore.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:35:15):**  There was this one property in Ontario that we were working on, and it had remnants of  
**[0:35:21-0:35:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:35:21):**  this old growth, Carolinian forest chunk.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:35:25):**  And the Carolinian forest is one of the most biodiverse forest systems in North America.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:35:29):**  And it comes right up into the southern part of Ontario, which is actually most people  
**[0:35:34-0:35:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:35:34):**  know this, but southern Ontario is the same latitude as California.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:35:39):**  And so it's got this very kind of tropical feel to it or subtropical feel to it, or Mediterranean,  
**[0:35:44-0:35:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:35:44):**  I guess would be a better representation of it.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:35:48):**  But it's a very, very unique forest structure.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:35:50):**  And so we went onto this property and it was they were growing soy and corn in rotation.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:35:56):**  And the soils were just hideous, like they were so bad, they didn't infiltrate.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:36:01):**  There was corn stover from two years ago.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:36:03):**  We knew that because of the rotation, so nothing was decomposing.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:36:05):**  So that gives you a lot of indication of what's going on there.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:36:09):**  And they were just pumping it with inputs.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:36:12):**  And then we saw this old block of forest just on the other side of the field.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:36:15):**  And we went over there, we were doing our visual soil assessment.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:36:20):**  And we dug in the forest and chocolate brown cake type soil just full of life.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:36:26):**  And there was acorns and walnuts on the ground, or at least the shells are remnants of it.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:36:35):**  And if you've ever read J. Russell Smith's permanent agriculture, I mean, it was basically  
**[0:36:41-0:36:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:36:41):**  the corn tree and the wheat tree and all of this other stuff.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:36:45):**  And there's no gnomes, there's no garden gnomes running around managing these systems.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:36:50):**  They're not inputting fertilizer.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:36:52):**  And so we're bringing our client there and we're saying like, look, this system has none  
**[0:36:56-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:36:56):**  of your input.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:36:57):**  And it's doing incredible.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:37:00):**  And this system, you're putting all these inputs in and it's going downhill.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:37:05):**  And so it really quickly becomes an incredible contrast that, again, creates insights in  
**[0:37:11-0:37:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:37:11):**  your head.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:37:12):**  It's like, what is that system doing that this system isn't?  
**[0:37:16-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:37:16):**  And then recognizing that, and this is part of the philosophy that I think Bill was trying  
**[0:37:22-0:37:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:37:22):**  to get across, is that humans are not inherently destructive.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:37:25):**  We just get the design wrong.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:37:27):**  And so we can actually, and in his other statement, which is everything gardens, we can actually  
**[0:37:33-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:37:33):**  intervene in that system in a way that actually improves its productivity.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:37:39):**  And we might choose to use that system as our zone five, but we can take the intelligence  
**[0:37:43-0:37:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:37:43):**  from that system and get all the same benefits and yields plus a whole bunch more by transporting  
**[0:37:50-0:37:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:37:50):**  that system onto this system.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:37:54):**  And so I think it comes back to diagnosis again, and that when you have some very simple  
**[0:37:59-0:38:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:37:59):**  tools that allow you to compare two systems in a very similar area, you can start to understand  
**[0:38:07-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:38:07):**  the differences.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:38:08):**  And then coming back to the soil samples, we had those two soil samples tested.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:38:11):**  So we knew one was dead because the corn was not rotting.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:38:15):**  There's no carbon, there was no infiltration.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:38:17):**  And the other one was absolutely alive with all the bugs and infiltration and everything  
**[0:38:22-0:38:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:38:22):**  else.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:38:23):**  And we went to the labs and the labs said the exact opposite.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:38:27):**  And we're just like, what?  
**[0:38:29-0:38:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:38:29):**  How is that possible?  
**[0:38:31-0:38:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:38:31):**  And we did this like a dozen times.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:38:35):**  And most of the time, the soils that we observed to be the most productive, healthy soils were  
**[0:38:43-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:38:43):**  the ones that the soil tests were saying were the least healthy.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:38:48):**  And so we really started to question the validity of the data.  
**[0:38:54-0:39:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:38:54):**  And we ended up in a situation where we had a conference in interior of British Columbia.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:39:01):**  And Dakota and I ended up in a debate with a PhD soil scientist.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:39:08):**  And we were talking about this to this young agrarian's group about some of our observations  
**[0:39:13-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:39:13):**  around the question of the validity of soil samples.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:39:16):**  And he really took offense to it because that had been his entire career.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:39:21):**  And then we asked some very poignant questions.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:39:24):**  And he basically confirmed our suspicion that he said, yeah, so all tests are kind of useless,  
**[0:39:29-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:39:29):**  but that doesn't mean we shouldn't do them.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:39:32):**  And which is kind of an interesting outcome.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:39:34):**  And so and that had a really big influence on kind of where we place soil and how much  
**[0:39:39-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:39:39):**  effort we put into trying to manipulate it.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:39:42):**  And so what we found is that when you get the water cycle, right, when you get the flora  
**[0:39:46-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:39:46):**  cycle right, when you get the fencing right, to keep the livestock in the right place at  
**[0:39:50-0:39:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:39:50):**  the right time for the right amount, scale, time, placement and form, everything else  
**[0:39:54-0:39:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:39:54):**  kind of follows suit.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:39:57):**  It's kind of like the design emerges, like your business will be better, your soil will  
**[0:40:02-0:40:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:40:02):**  be better.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:40:03):**  Your plants will be happier.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:40:05):**  So diagnosis, diagnosis, diagnosis, and making sure that you've got some of those simple  
**[0:40:12-0:40:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:40:12):**  heuristics that you can rely upon so that when you go to a site, you kind of know where  
**[0:40:17-0:40:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:40:17):**  you're starting, you know what the middle part is, you know what the ending is, and  
**[0:40:20-0:40:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:40:20):**  then you're kind of filling in the gaps in between.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:40:22):**  Yeah, I love that example.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:40:24):**  What a fantastic story.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:40:25):**  And it really goes along with what I've been finding with the projects I've done in the  
**[0:40:29-0:40:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:40:29):**  field too.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:40:30):**  And even up to this point where we try and assess as much as we can of the health of  
**[0:40:34-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:40:34):**  a place by simple observation and simple tools, just like you say in Dakota has come up to  
**[0:40:39-0:40:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:40:39):**  as well, observing how the plants are doing before you even start to dig.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:40:44):**  And then just using basic hand tools, the texture of the soil, the things that you can  
**[0:40:49-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:40:49):**  observe yourself before you ever go into the microbiology and the mineral content itself,  
**[0:40:57-0:41:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:40:57):**  especially when the results of that are conflicting with what you can objectively see as well.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:41:03):**  I think we give a lot of confidence in these high tech solutions and people with advanced  
**[0:41:10-0:41:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:41:10):**  degrees and forget the power that we have to really just pay attention and look around  
**[0:41:16-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:41:16):**  and observe and use that as the feedback loop that's necessary to make effective interventions,  
**[0:41:22-0:41:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:41:22):**  especially when we're working on limited budgets or resources, like you were talking about  
**[0:41:26-0:41:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:41:26):**  to help make those decisions.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:41:28):**  Now let's focus again a little on these smaller scale projects because that's where most people  
**[0:41:35-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:41:35):**  are coming from.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:41:36):**  And it's also where I'm sure you as well get a lot of the questions about, oh, what can  
**[0:41:40-0:41:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:41:40):**  I do?  
**[0:41:41-0:41:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:41:41):**  I don't have enough space and people feeling a little helpless thinking that they need  
**[0:41:45-0:41:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:41:45):**  a lot of space in order to do anything meaningful, especially for their own lives.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:41:50):**  What are some of the most persistent myths and misconceptions about what can be done  
**[0:41:55-0:42:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:41:55):**  on a small property as well as some of the, I guess, assumptions of what is going to be  
**[0:42:03-0:42:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:42:03):**  easy to do because it's small?  
**[0:42:05-0:42:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:42:05):**  I find inconsistencies on both ends.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:42:09):**  Okay, so, I mean, this is an audio format, but if folks can kind of remember back to  
**[0:42:18-0:42:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:42:18):**  probably grade nine or grade 10 mathematics, when we learned how to figure out the area  
**[0:42:26-0:42:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:42:26):**  of a circle, the area of a circle is pi r squared.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:42:30):**  So 3.14 times the radius squared, and that's the surface area of a circle, so two-dimensional  
**[0:42:37-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:42:37):**  object.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:42:39):**  And because of that r squared in there, if you map out or if you graph out the area of  
**[0:42:46-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:42:46):**  a circle on a spreadsheet, and you change the radius one, two, three, four, five, six,  
**[0:42:54-0:42:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:42:54):**  seven, eight, nine, and then you put that on a graph, because there's a squared function  
**[0:42:58-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:42:58):**  in there, the amount of energy that it takes to manage a circle as you go further and further  
**[0:43:07-0:43:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:43:07):**  out increases exponentially because of the r squared, right?  
**[0:43:12-0:43:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:43:12):**  The square is an exponential function.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:43:14):**  And so this is why zones are so important because we recognize that as you move further  
**[0:43:24-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:43:24):**  away from your center of energy, it doesn't become like being twice as far away doesn't  
**[0:43:28-0:43:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:43:28):**  become twice as much work to manage.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:43:32):**  It's like it's r squared as much work to manage when you get that much further away.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:43:37):**  But unfortunately for you and me, we don't live in a two-dimensional world.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:43:40):**  We live in a three-dimensional world.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:43:42):**  And so we actually have to think about the function in terms of r cubed.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:43:46):**  So the volume of a hemisphere, I think is four thirds pi r cubed.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:43:54):**  And somebody might correct me on that.  
**[0:43:55-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:43:55):**  I haven't looked it up recently, but the point is, is that the r is cubed, not squared.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:44:00):**  And so when we start working in the vertical space, which is really important when we're  
**[0:44:03-0:44:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:44:03):**  in urban environments, we're now, we do have a limit to how far up we can go.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:44:10):**  We're not flying in airplanes.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:44:11):**  So we'll call it two meters, maybe, or six feet.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:44:16):**  But now we're expanding the area in a two-dimensional space while maintaining all of the productivity  
**[0:44:22-0:44:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:44:22):**  from the ground up to six feet.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:44:24):**  And so that becomes infinitely more complex because now we're not, our curve is not going  
**[0:44:29-0:44:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:44:29):**  up as a square, it's going up as a cube.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:44:33):**  And so basically to simplify that down, it's a much steeper curve, which means the further  
**[0:44:38-0:44:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:44:38):**  away you go, the more opportunities to manage that exist.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:44:42):**  You can say it in the other way as well, is that the further, like the area that you manage,  
**[0:44:50-0:44:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:44:50):**  if it's a smaller area, you can increase the amount of intensity that you have, or you  
**[0:44:57-0:45:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:44:57):**  have more energy to spend on a smaller amount of space.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:45:01):**  And so I actually absolutely love small scale design.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:45:06):**  I don't do it anymore because I like being on learning curves.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:45:08):**  It's just one of my problems, but I used to go, this is a little exercise people can do.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:45:15):**  And I found this was probably one of the best things that I ever did when I first got into  
**[0:45:18-0:45:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:45:18):**  permaculture because I was, I'm an engineer, I'm not a landscape designer and I still stand  
**[0:45:22-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:45:22):**  behind that.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:45:23):**  I'm not, I can't make landscapes look good.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:45:25):**  I just mimic, yeah, mimic nature.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:45:30):**  And if people like the way a forest looks, they'll probably like the way my stuff look,  
**[0:45:34-0:45:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:45:34):**  but I don't use aesthetic as my primary driver, but I call it back alley creeping.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:45:41):**  And so coming back to our, how we started this conversation, we have a critical eye.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:45:46):**  Most of us have critical eyes for what we like and what we don't like.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:45:49):**  And most of the time it's easier for us to say what we don't like than what it is that  
**[0:45:52-0:45:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:45:52):**  we do like.  
**[0:45:54-0:46:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:45:54):**  And so when my son was young I put him on our bike and we would drive down back alleys  
**[0:46:01-0:46:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:46:01):**  in Calgary and we would creep over people's fences.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:46:05):**  And I lived in a neighborhood where this was socially acceptable more than other neighborhoods  
**[0:46:10-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:46:10):**  and fences were generally pretty low.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:46:12):**  And I would spend a long time just standing there kind of, you know, what's the word,  
**[0:46:21-0:46:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:46:21):**  I wasn't stalking people.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:46:22):**  Let's just put it that way.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:46:23):**  I was just looking at their backyards and I would kind of look at like where elements  
**[0:46:27-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:46:27):**  were placed.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:46:28):**  But I, and this is an exercise I give to my students and I say, you know, in five minutes  
**[0:46:33-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:46:33):**  design the property.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:46:35):**  Where would the rain barrel go?  
**[0:46:36-0:46:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:46:36):**  Where does the garden go?  
**[0:46:37-0:46:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:46:37):**  Where does the food forest go?  
**[0:46:39-0:46:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:46:39):**  Where would you put a solar array?  
**[0:46:41-0:46:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:46:41):**  Would you take some of the windows out of the house and put them in other places to  
**[0:46:44-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:46:44):**  maximize solar gain?  
**[0:46:47-0:46:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:46:47):**  And after a few of these exercises, you know, people get it.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:46:53):**  And so I did this one course in Calgary, it was a walkabout and we got a local community  
**[0:46:59-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:46:59):**  together and they chose five houses.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:47:02):**  There was probably 15 to 25 people in this group.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:47:05):**  And we went to the three houses with the group and I said, okay, you guys design it.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:47:10):**  You've got 10 minutes and they would kind of get into little groups and they without  
**[0:47:14-0:47:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:47:14):**  much knowledge of permaculture and they would come up with amazing little designs.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:47:18):**  It was great.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:47:19):**  And then I would come in and say, okay, this is how I see it.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:47:21):**  And it was like, and people would have insights and they would learn something.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:47:27):**  And so you can start to practice this design on your own.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:47:32):**  And the reason to do this is that in an urban property, you are space constrained.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:47:38):**  And so, whereas on a rural property, you're not space constrained.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:47:42):**  And so rural people almost always get drunk on space.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:47:47):**  They literally become inebriated and then shit just goes everywhere.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:47:52):**  And then they create this massive problem for themselves.  
**[0:47:54-0:48:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:47:54):**  And they're constantly trying to run around to just keep everything alive.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:48:00):**  You don't have that problem in an urban space.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:48:02):**  Your problem in an urban space is you don't have enough space.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:48:05):**  And so you have to understand sun angles and you have to understand access to water and  
**[0:48:11-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:48:11):**  you have to understand the kind of physiology of plants so that you know which plants should  
**[0:48:17-0:48:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:48:17):**  go to the north in the northern hemisphere and which plants should go to the south.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:48:22):**  And you have to understand how shade propagates and where frost comes from.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:48:27):**  And we had a massive garden out here on our farm last year.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:48:31):**  And I'm pretty sure we produced less food on this massive garden last year than we did  
**[0:48:36-0:48:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:48:36):**  typically on our tiny little 5,000 square foot poster sized lot in the city.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:48:42):**  Just because there is a huge learning curve for us to be able to manage this huge area  
**[0:48:46-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:48:46):**  amongst all of the other construction projects that are going on.  
**[0:48:49-0:49:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:48:49):**  So I'm all on board with David Holmgren's new book, Retro Suburbia.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:49:00):**  And I actually think that the development pattern for the equitable or regenerative  
**[0:49:07-0:49:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:49:07):**  future for humans, for most people, are going to be in small towns.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:49:13):**  And ironically, maybe in suburbia, where you can have between half to one acre.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:49:19):**  That's more than enough room to grow all of your eggs and most of your vegetables.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:49:26):**  And it's just going to be about being disciplined about how you use space.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:49:30):**  And there's so much creativity that can go into these small spaces, as I'm sure you talked  
**[0:49:34-0:49:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:49:34):**  with all of your students about as well.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:49:37):**  I'm so glad you brought that up.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:49:38):**  And like, first of all, like I started in engineering as well.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:49:41):**  And that's often the reference that I go to in my own design thinking.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:49:45):**  But I find myself working a lot with larger scale farmers, just through my work with the  
**[0:49:50-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:49:50):**  community and the academy in climate farmers.  
**[0:49:54-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:49:54):**  But still wanting to come back to these smaller spaces, which is really how I got started  
**[0:49:58-0:50:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:49:58):**  out, which was in natural building and home design.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:50:01):**  Because that's where I saw the possibility for design to have the most impact on people's  
**[0:50:09-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:50:09):**  lives.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:50:11):**  For the most part, people spend a majority of their time indoors these days.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:50:16):**  And even more so if you go into the cold climates, not so much here in Spain, where I've ended  
**[0:50:20-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:50:20):**  up.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:50:21):**  But I mean, even if we're just talking about sleeping time, there's a huge opportunity  
**[0:50:26-0:50:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:50:26):**  to create environments for health for well being in these areas that we spend so much  
**[0:50:32-0:50:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:50:32):**  of our time and where the concentration of energy and functions in most people's lives  
**[0:50:38-0:50:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:50:38):**  tend to be and then start to go out from there.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:50:41):**  And I think it's often very much overlooked the potential of intervening at the zone zero  
**[0:50:48-0:50:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:50:48):**  places.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:50:49):**  I think, you know, maybe even because of the naming, the fact that one and two, they start  
**[0:50:53-0:50:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:50:53):**  as far as you start to get further away from the nucleus of the cell of where we live.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:50:59):**  But like you said that the intensity and the amount of considerations when you have those  
**[0:51:03-0:51:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:51:03):**  types of creative constraints, that having a massive property often allows you to it's  
**[0:51:09-0:51:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:51:09):**  almost like having a huge budget.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:51:11):**  People make some of the worst decisions when they can solve them with an excess of a certain  
**[0:51:15-0:51:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:51:15):**  resource.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:51:18):**  And by coming back and trying to solve them with the resource that isn't the easiest one  
**[0:51:22-0:51:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:51:22):**  to spend, often creates much more creative solutions and intuitive problem solving than  
**[0:51:30-0:51:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:51:30):**  than being able to chuck resources at a problem otherwise, whether it be space or money or  
**[0:51:34-0:51:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:51:34):**  whatever you might have.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:51:36):**  Now, I want to go into one other aspect of something that you've been putting out content  
**[0:51:41-0:51:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:51:41):**  on for a while.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:51:42):**  And I've seen some new videos and opportunities at Verge.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:51:45):**  And that is creating an economy out of this type of thinking, this type of design, the  
**[0:51:51-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:51:51):**  opportunities in permaculture to create a livelihood, to build a business.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:51:56):**  And you've come up with some videos guiding ideas that you've had that you just don't  
**[0:52:01-0:52:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:52:01):**  have time to pursue.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:52:03):**  But also speaking to people who feel a little bit lost about what the next steps to go and  
**[0:52:08-0:52:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:52:08):**  make this a bigger part of their life after getting a PDC or after doing a few designs.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:52:14):**  Maybe you can reiterate some of those concepts and some of the inspiration that you transmit  
**[0:52:19-0:52:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:52:19):**  through that content of where these opportunities are and where they're starting to emerge as  
**[0:52:24-0:52:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:52:24):**  things develop, especially in the post pandemic world.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:52:28):**  Yeah, let's hope it is the post pandemic world.  
**[0:52:31-0:52:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:52:31):**  Like the long tail of the post.  
**[0:52:34-0:52:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:52:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:35-0:52:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:52:35):**  Okay, so yeah, it's really interesting.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:52:38):**  So I just want to tap in on one thing there before we move on to the next subject.  
**[0:52:42-0:52:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:52:42):**  But it's for people that are working on small scale properties that have ambitions to move  
**[0:52:47-0:52:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:52:47):**  with large scale properties.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:52:49):**  Everything you learn in the small scale is applicable at the large scale.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:52:53):**  And I actually think you become a better designer by starting on the small scale and moving  
**[0:52:58-0:53:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:52:58):**  up versus starting at the large scale and moving down because every rural property has  
**[0:53:03-0:53:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:53:03):**  a zone one.  
**[0:53:06-0:53:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:53:06):**  And if you can't make that efficient, then all of your other zones are going to collapse.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:53:09):**  So don't be disenfranchised if you have ambitions to go bigger and you're on a small property  
**[0:53:14-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:53:14):**  right now.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:53:15):**  There's lots to learn there.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:53:17):**  The reality is, is that the technical stuff is is tons of fun.  
**[0:53:24-0:53:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:53:24):**  There's always learning curves to get on because because in permaculture we have, we touch  
**[0:53:29-0:53:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:53:29):**  so many different domains like architecture and biology and physics and thermodynamics  
**[0:53:35-0:53:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:53:35):**  and you know, livestock or animal husbandry.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:53:39):**  I mean, it's just like every every time you turn your head, there's another learning curve  
**[0:53:43-0:53:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:53:43):**  to hop on to.  
**[0:53:46-0:53:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:53:46):**  And you can't be an expert at all of it.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:53:49):**  But the Internet and all the books that have been written about all these domains have  
**[0:53:55-0:54:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:53:55):**  really done a service to all of us, because even if you're on a big learning curve, I  
**[0:54:00-0:54:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:54:00):**  mean, you know, YouTube University or whatever video streaming service you want to go to,  
**[0:54:05-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:54:05):**  there's likely going to be some information on that.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:54:08):**  Some of it's going to be garbage.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:54:11):**  And so you can kind of figure that out.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:54:13):**  But the piece that Mollison was trying to get across in Chapter 14 was was that and  
**[0:54:20-0:54:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:54:20):**  what Dave Jackie and and Tonesmeyer talks about as invisible structures requires all  
**[0:54:27-0:54:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:54:27):**  the same design thinking.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:54:29):**  But because these components are not tangible, they're harder to think about.  
**[0:54:35-0:54:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:54:35):**  And and so the first, second, third, fourth wave of permaculturists have all had to kind  
**[0:54:41-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:54:41):**  of be entrepreneurs in order to make a livelihood doing this.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:54:45):**  And I would say that the next wave is going to have to do that as well.  
**[0:54:48-0:54:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:54:48):**  We're not quite at the stage where we've got kind of companies that there aren't that many  
**[0:54:52-0:54:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:54:52):**  companies that are hiring hiring permaculturists yet, but I don't think we're far away from  
**[0:54:57-0:54:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:54:57):**  that.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:54:58):**  We're actually pretty close to to kind of reaching that paradigm.  
**[0:55:04-0:55:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:55:04):**  And so I'm not sure what it is within permaculture that creates the strong, tall poppy syndrome  
**[0:55:13-0:55:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:55:13):**  that exists within our space.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:55:17):**  But I mean, one business or opportunity that will exist for the end of until the end of  
**[0:55:22-0:55:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:55:22):**  time, as far as I can see out into the future is teaching.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:55:26):**  And it's the it's the thing that people criticize the most.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:55:29):**  It's like, oh, the only way to make money in permaculture is to teach.  
**[0:55:32-0:55:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:55:32):**  It's like, so what are you giving people value or not?  
**[0:55:37-0:55:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:55:37):**  And I just met a report from the UK permaculture group and they said there's about three million  
**[0:55:42-0:55:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:55:42):**  people on planet Earth practicing permaculture conservatively, which is bigger than I was  
**[0:55:46-0:55:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:55:46):**  expecting and quite surprising and awesome.  
**[0:55:50-0:55:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:55:50):**  But three million relative to seven billion is we're not even scratching the surface.  
**[0:55:55-0:55:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:55:55):**  And so how many universities teach engineering?  
**[0:55:58-0:56:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:55:58):**  How many universities teach architects?  
**[0:56:01-0:56:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:56:01):**  There's thousands of them.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:56:04):**  And so if you have an aptitude to teach and you can and again, the other thing that happens  
**[0:56:11-0:56:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:56:11):**  within the space is you take a PVC.  
**[0:56:13-0:56:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:56:13):**  And I used to teach the entire course by myself.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:56:15):**  And somehow I managed to know enough about the domains to be able to teach it all.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:56:18):**  But you don't have to know everything.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:56:22):**  You just need to know how to find people that know things and and collaborate with them  
**[0:56:27-0:56:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:56:27):**  and create mutually beneficial relationships.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:56:30):**  And so teaching is a fantastic vocation and you can make a living doing it.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:56:36):**  I've done it for the last 15 years and I encourage all of my students to go into teaching.  
**[0:56:41-0:56:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:56:41):**  I support them in their their aspirations.  
**[0:56:44-0:56:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:56:44):**  We promote them.  
**[0:56:46-0:56:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:56:46):**  And it's not I don't think of it think of it as competition whatsoever.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:56:50):**  We could have a thousand Jeff Lawton's out there and we still wouldn't be teaching enough.  
**[0:56:54-0:56:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:56:54):**  Jeff and I had a conversation not that long ago and he said, Rob, I did the math.  
**[0:56:58-0:57:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:56:58):**  And he says, if we're going to kind of move the planet to a permaculture paradigm, we  
**[0:57:04-0:57:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:57:04):**  have to teach something like 300 million students a day.  
**[0:57:08-0:57:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:57:08):**  Some some I can't remember the number.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:57:09):**  It was three hundred thousand.  
**[0:57:10-0:57:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:57:10):**  I'm probably off by an order of magnitude, but it was an insane number of people.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:57:15):**  If you just did this and then out of those students, like one out of one hundred became  
**[0:57:20-0:57:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:57:20):**  teachers, it still would take us 30 years to get there.  
**[0:57:23-0:57:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:57:23):**  It was an insane number.  
**[0:57:24-0:57:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:57:24):**  So education is absolutely a fantastic vocation if you've got it in you to do it.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:57:30):**  Consulting, I cannot keep up with with the consulting side of my business right now.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:57:36):**  And it's not just fringe like kind of early adopters now.  
**[0:57:41-0:57:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:57:41):**  We have.  
**[0:57:44-0:57:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:57:44):**  Billionaires and millionaires coming to us wanting these things.  
**[0:57:48-0:57:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:57:48):**  They're putting their money now into these systems.  
**[0:57:49-0:57:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:57:49):**  They want food forests.  
**[0:57:52-0:57:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:57:52):**  They want solar arrays.  
**[0:57:53-0:57:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:57:53):**  They want passive homes.  
**[0:57:56-0:57:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:57:56):**  And I'm not an expert in every one of those areas.  
**[0:57:58-0:58:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:57:58):**  I have a team of people that come in and help with these things.  
**[0:58:04-0:58:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:58:04):**  Another one that urbanites like you can make money at farming, believe it or not.  
**[0:58:13-0:58:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:58:13):**  And it's not easy, but urbanites are willing to pay a premium.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:58:20):**  The people are waking up to the fact that our food is covered in poison and people are  
**[0:58:24-0:58:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:58:24):**  willing to pay more money to know that their food is not covered in poison.  
**[0:58:28-0:58:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:58:28):**  And so that opens opportunities up for niche gardeners.  
**[0:58:31-0:58:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:58:31):**  And but here's here's the crux.  
**[0:58:35-0:58:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:58:35):**  The ideas are not really the weak link.  
**[0:58:40-0:58:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:58:40):**  The weak link is understanding some some basic.  
**[0:58:45-0:58:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:58:45):**  Entrepreneurial principles that can be taught, but they require a lot of deep programming.  
**[0:58:53-0:58:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:58:53):**  And so a lot of people go into permaculture, want to start their own business, but they're  
**[0:58:57-0:59:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:58:57):**  scared of money and they're scared of asking people for money for them to do things.  
**[0:59:01-0:59:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:59:01):**  And so there's two or three root causes to that.  
**[0:59:03-0:59:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:59:03):**  One of them is the lack of self-confidence, which is understanding if it's a new thing.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:59:08):**  But there's ways around it.  
**[0:59:09-0:59:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:59:09):**  So if you're getting into consulting, find somebody like me out there or like Oliver  
**[0:59:15-0:59:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:59:15):**  who you can pay money to to mentor you so that when you're finishing a design, you've  
**[0:59:21-0:59:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:59:21):**  got his name on it.  
**[0:59:22-0:59:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:59:22):**  You've done all the work.  
**[0:59:23-0:59:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:59:23):**  He's just reviewed it and made sure that that you're not going to create type one errors.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:59:27):**  Go pay people like guys like Oliver and I have spent years perfecting our professions.  
**[0:59:35-0:59:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:59:35):**  It's not something we can afford to give away for free because there's a ton of demand for  
**[0:59:38-0:59:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:59:38):**  our time, but we're super happy to exchange value.  
**[0:59:44-0:59:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:59:44):**  And so find a mentor, go get a mentor to help you with that.  
**[0:59:47-0:59:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:59:47):**  Another thing is like a very basic understanding of how value works.  
**[0:59:51-0:59:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:59:51):**  And it seems like a silly thing to talk about, but most people don't understand the concept  
**[0:59:55-0:59:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:59:55):**  of value.  
**[0:59:57-1:00:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=0:59:57):**  And so that's a whole other conversation in that in that piece.  
**[1:00:02-1:00:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:00:02):**  And so you need to really get clear on why they charge and and how to show a professional  
**[1:00:12-1:00:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:00:12):**  and how to make sure you have the people and the resources around you so that you can succeed.  
**[1:00:17-1:00:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:00:17):**  And if you can get all that stuff right, then your idea will likely succeed or have a much  
**[1:00:22-1:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:00:22):**  better chance of succeeding.  
**[1:00:23-1:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:00:23):**  But most of the people that fail don't understand these these basic, basic things because it's  
**[1:00:29-1:00:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:00:29):**  never really taught.  
**[1:00:31-1:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:00:31):**  Farmers fail because farmers don't understand value.  
**[1:00:33-1:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:00:33):**  They don't understand marketing.  
**[1:00:34-1:00:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:00:34):**  You don't understand how to create connections with people.  
**[1:00:37-1:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:00:37):**  They don't know how to find hubs.  
**[1:00:39-1:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:00:39):**  And so it's hard enough to learn all the different domains in permaculture.  
**[1:00:43-1:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:00:43):**  And then when you realize there's no jobs out there and you want to make a livelihood,  
**[1:00:46-1:00:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:00:46):**  then you've got to hop onto another learning curve, which is like all of the domains that  
**[1:00:50-1:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:00:50):**  exist within business.  
**[1:00:51-1:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:00:51):**  And somehow you've got to live with those.  
**[1:00:53-1:00:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:00:53):**  You got to spend as much time in the permaculture stuff as you can.  
**[1:00:56-1:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:00:56):**  And then you got to jump over and figure out all the business stuff.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:00:59):**  And so you end up kind of straddling the two worlds until you kind of more or less learn  
**[1:01:05-1:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:01:05):**  both of them.  
**[1:01:06-1:01:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:01:06):**  And then you things get easier.  
**[1:01:08-1:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:01:08):**  But yeah, there's there's literally an untapped demand.  
**[1:01:13-1:01:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:01:13):**  And it's I say to my students, we there's a tsunami coming behind us and you're lucky  
**[1:01:20-1:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:01:20):**  enough to have had taken a PDC in the last 20 years or beyond and get on your surfboard  
**[1:01:27-1:01:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:01:27):**  and start start paddling because you got a power before the wave comes here.  
**[1:01:31-1:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:01:31):**  And I think that what permaculturists are going to be, they're already in huge demand.  
**[1:01:38-1:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:01:38):**  They're going to be an even huger demand within five to 10 years.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:01:41):**  When you look at where the world is going to geopolitically, you look at peak oil, peak  
**[1:01:46-1:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:01:46):**  phosphorus, peak water, we're literally at the end of civilization.  
**[1:01:52-1:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:01:52):**  And the exact people that will help redirect us into the next paradigm are permaculture  
**[1:01:57-1:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:01:57):**  designers that have an understanding of generalist principles.  
**[1:02:02-1:02:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:02:02):**  That's very well said.  
**[1:02:03-1:02:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:02:03):**  And that's why I really wanted to get a message like that repeated, even though you do have  
**[1:02:07-1:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:02:07):**  so many points of context out there and the videos and other things that you've been saying  
**[1:02:13-1:02:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:02:13):**  for a long time, because it needs to be repeated.  
**[1:02:16-1:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:02:16):**  I really like what you said as well about the mentorship aspect.  
**[1:02:20-1:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:02:20):**  Because for some reason, there seems to be a disconnect in our culture the way there  
**[1:02:24-1:02:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:02:24):**  wasn't perhaps 60 or 70 years ago in the assumption that when you finish your formal training,  
**[1:02:30-1:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:02:30):**  you go straight into the job market without some kind of guidance to make that transition.  
**[1:02:36-1:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:02:36):**  And I myself have gotten a huge benefit of mentorship at many points in the past.  
**[1:02:41-1:02:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:02:41):**  And that's exactly why I've started to shift my own consultancy into coaching and mentorship,  
**[1:02:47-1:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:02:47):**  because I realized that I can offer a lot of assistance in what people are actually  
**[1:02:52-1:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:02:52):**  asking me at a lower price point when I kind of group people who are asking the same questions,  
**[1:02:57-1:03:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:02:57):**  and then making content out of that so that even more people can access it for free.  
**[1:03:03-1:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:03:03):**  And then if someone wants really dedicated, specific attention on their project, well,  
**[1:03:08-1:03:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:03:08):**  then you have an appropriate price point for that as well.  
**[1:03:11-1:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:03:11):**  And that way, people can enter and access and get the support that they need at whatever  
**[1:03:16-1:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:03:16):**  resource base that they have access to.  
**[1:03:19-1:03:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:03:19):**  And then also using that as an opportunity to create community around it, which the internet  
**[1:03:24-1:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:03:24):**  has given us an awesome benefit in being able to crowdsource answers and crowdsource support.  
**[1:03:31-1:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:03:31):**  So within that, and then finding that niche, like you said, permaculture covers essentially  
**[1:03:37-1:03:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:03:37):**  everything if you apply the mindset to it, right?  
**[1:03:40-1:03:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:03:40):**  Go and figure out what a permaculture ice cream shop would be and find a way to make  
**[1:03:45-1:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:03:45):**  money at it, right?  
**[1:03:46-1:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:03:46):**  The concept, the principles can be applied to almost every current vocation and ones  
**[1:03:53-1:03:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:03:53):**  that we haven't even thought of or aren't relevant yet until the technology makes it  
**[1:03:56-1:03:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:03:56):**  possible, right?  
**[1:03:58-1:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:03:58):**  And people like you and I who have been generalists for a long time, rely heavily on those who  
**[1:04:04-1:04:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:04:04):**  specialize in these other things that we can't add that level of specificity and expertise  
**[1:04:08-1:04:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:04:08):**  in.  
**[1:04:09-1:04:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:04:09):**  But through that collaboration, we can deliver the service and the necessary support to the  
**[1:04:14-1:04:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:04:14):**  people who are doing the work.  
**[1:04:17-1:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:04:17):**  Very well said.  
**[1:04:18-1:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:04:18):**  And there's one last question that I would like to explore with you here.  
**[1:04:22-1:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:04:22):**  And I'm starting to ask everybody this now, because some of the most interesting things  
**[1:04:27-1:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:04:27):**  come out of it.  
**[1:04:28-1:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:04:28):**  And you gave me a little preview before this interview started, but what are you most excited  
**[1:04:32-1:04:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:04:32):**  about?  
**[1:04:33-1:04:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:04:33):**  What are you working on and really motivated to see come to fruition in this upcoming year?  
**[1:04:41-1:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:04:41):**  So I've often said, if I just had the resources of the US military, we could solve all of  
**[1:04:50-1:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:04:50):**  these ecological problems in a decade.  
**[1:04:53-1:04:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:04:53):**  Like it wouldn't, if you had the organizational structure and the money and the tools and  
**[1:04:59-1:05:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:04:59):**  machines, like there's this cartoon that Bernard Lyotard shows in one of his TED Talks.  
**[1:05:08-1:05:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:05:08):**  He's the architect behind the Euro, which he deeply regrets.  
**[1:05:14-1:05:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:05:14):**  And it's this image of these decrepit looking humans on the side of a street and they're  
**[1:05:22-1:05:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:05:22):**  drunk and they're high.  
**[1:05:23-1:05:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:05:23):**  They look sickly.  
**[1:05:26-1:05:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:05:26):**  Some of them are starving and like the air is dirty and the water flowing down a little  
**[1:05:33-1:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:05:33):**  like a stream next to it is, you know, the fish are dead and the water is polluted.  
**[1:05:40-1:05:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:05:40):**  And these aliens come down and they go up to one of the humans and they say, like, why  
**[1:05:47-1:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:05:47):**  does earth look like this?  
**[1:05:49-1:05:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:05:49):**  Do you guys not know how to fix it?  
**[1:05:52-1:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:05:52):**  And they're like, no, no, we totally know how to fix it.  
**[1:05:54-1:05:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:05:54):**  It's like, it's easy.  
**[1:05:57-1:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:05:57):**  We've known it for a long time.  
**[1:05:59-1:06:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:05:59):**  We're just waiting for someone to pay us.  
**[1:06:03-1:06:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:06:03):**  And so, you know, Mollison in his autobiography, I read this at the end of my PDC every time,  
**[1:06:11-1:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:06:11):**  says that permaculturists now have more people than the UN on the ground doing work around  
**[1:06:18-1:06:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:06:18):**  the earth and that the sun never sets on permaculture.  
**[1:06:20-1:06:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:06:20):**  When you're going to sleep at night, somebody else is waking up to like Oliver is waking  
**[1:06:25-1:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:06:25):**  up when I'm going to bed, getting ready to start his day and do the work that he does.  
**[1:06:32-1:06:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:06:32):**  And so the sun never sets on planet Earth on permaculture.  
**[1:06:36-1:06:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:06:36):**  And so that cartoon and that statement in his autobiography and then also thinking about  
**[1:06:44-1:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:06:44):**  this kind of the resources of the military have been on my mind for a long time and kind  
**[1:06:48-1:06:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:06:48):**  of starting to realize that my like as I've evolved as a teacher, Jeff and Bilbo said,  
**[1:06:57-1:07:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:06:57):**  Jeff said this to me, if nobody else is doing it and you see the opportunity for it to happen,  
**[1:07:02-1:07:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:07:02):**  then it's obviously got to be you.  
**[1:07:06-1:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:07:06):**  And and so anyways, I was consulting on a project not that long ago, two years ago,  
**[1:07:11-1:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:07:11):**  I guess, and ended up working for some clients in B.C. who were amazing clients.  
**[1:07:20-1:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:07:20):**  And we were building a pass, a greenhouse and completely terraforming this quarter section  
**[1:07:25-1:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:07:25):**  of land to harvest water.  
**[1:07:26-1:07:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:07:26):**  And they were just amazed at what we were doing.  
**[1:07:29-1:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:07:29):**  And I ended up on a call with them kind of towards the end of the consultancy.  
**[1:07:37-1:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:07:37):**  And I said, I said this, I said, if only I had the resources of the U.S. military, I  
**[1:07:41-1:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:07:41):**  could do this right across planet Earth in a really short period of time.  
**[1:07:44-1:07:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:07:44):**  And they said, OK, write me a précis on.  
**[1:07:48-1:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:07:48):**  On that, so I went away and I wrote a four page document on how I would go about regenerating  
**[1:07:55-1:07:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:07:55):**  planet Earth by 2047.  
**[1:07:56-1:07:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:07:56):**  That was the document's name.  
**[1:07:59-1:08:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:07:59):**  And I chose 2047 because I'm going to be really old by then.  
**[1:08:03-1:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:08:03):**  It better be done by that time.  
**[1:08:06-1:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:08:06):**  And it seemed like a neat year.  
**[1:08:08-1:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:08:08):**  Well, these clients were the co-founders of Ethereum.  
**[1:08:12-1:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:08:12):**  And they said, OK.  
**[1:08:15-1:08:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:08:15):**  We're on board.  
**[1:08:16-1:08:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:08:16):**  Let's start a company.  
**[1:08:18-1:08:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:08:18):**  So we started Fifth World.  
**[1:08:21-1:08:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:08:21):**  And so Fifth World's mission, which is what I'm spending all of my time on right now,  
**[1:08:26-1:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:08:26):**  is to find a way to incentivize Earth's land managers who represent at least a significant  
**[1:08:33-1:08:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:08:33):**  portion of the problem that exists.  
**[1:08:35-1:08:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:08:35):**  So phosphorus and nitrogen pollution, most of the GHGs have come as a result.  
**[1:08:40-1:08:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:08:40):**  Dr. Rattan Lal has said that most of the GHGs on planet Earth are the result of plowing  
**[1:08:45-1:08:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:08:45):**  fields, not from fossil fuels.  
**[1:08:49-1:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:08:49):**  And we know that when we lose soil carbon, that also other bad things happen as well,  
**[1:08:53-1:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:08:53):**  which lead to all of the other consequences that we're all aware of right now.  
**[1:08:58-1:09:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:08:58):**  And so if, in fact, we know how to do it and we're just waiting for someone to pay us,  
**[1:09:03-1:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:09:03):**  then we better start figuring out how to pay the people that are managing most of Earth's  
**[1:09:09-1:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:09:09):**  ecosystems and recognize that if we don't get it right, even though they own that land,  
**[1:09:17-1:09:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:09:17):**  they have a direct influence on the quality of our water, the quality of our air, the  
**[1:09:23-1:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:09:23):**  quality of our food.  
**[1:09:25-1:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:09:25):**  And it behooves us to not figure out how to change the incentives on planet Earth.  
**[1:09:34-1:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:09:34):**  And so we have a very small window of time where we can work with things like cryptocurrencies  
**[1:09:41-1:09:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:09:41):**  and smart contracts to influence the incentives on planet Earth in a very large scale and  
**[1:09:50-1:09:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:09:50):**  kind of feathering or riding on the coattails of the internet as well.  
**[1:09:59-1:10:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:09:59):**  Because right now what we're asking our farmers, we ask them to produce food, cheap.  
**[1:10:04-1:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:10:04):**  That's the first thing we typically ask.  
**[1:10:05-1:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:10:05):**  And then we ask for it to be nutrient dense.  
**[1:10:07-1:10:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:10:07):**  And then we ask for it to not have herbicides and pesticides.  
**[1:10:10-1:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:10:10):**  And now we want them to also sequester carbon.  
**[1:10:14-1:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:10:14):**  We want them to create space for birds, we want them to create space for deer and for  
**[1:10:20-1:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:10:20):**  insects.  
**[1:10:21-1:10:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:10:21):**  And we're asking a heck of a lot of a lot for these people who are all growing and feeding  
**[1:10:26-1:10:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:10:26):**  into a commodity system that really is only designed to incentivize price and volume.  
**[1:10:33-1:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:10:33):**  And so if we don't figure this out, because the population I do believe the population  
**[1:10:36-1:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:10:36):**  is on the verge of a collapse, just a demographic collapse in the next 20 or 30 years, but there's  
**[1:10:41-1:10:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:10:41):**  still a lot of people to feed regardless of that demographic collapse.  
**[1:10:46-1:10:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:10:46):**  If we don't find a way of working together and paying, or at least contributing to the  
**[1:10:57-1:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:10:57):**  benefits that we all want, the wellbeing, we'll finish with that.  
**[1:11:03-1:11:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:11:03):**  And our wellbeing is directly linked to the wellbeing of the people that are managing  
**[1:11:06-1:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:11:06):**  all the land on earth.  
**[1:11:08-1:11:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:11:08):**  Then we'll end up with a tragedy of the commons.  
**[1:11:12-1:11:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:11:12):**  And that means the end of humanity.  
**[1:11:16-1:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:11:16):**  Earth will reboot, it's already done it six times, it'll do it again.  
**[1:11:20-1:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:11:20):**  So the question we have to ask ourselves is, do we want to be part of that community of  
**[1:11:24-1:11:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:11:24):**  life?  
**[1:11:25-1:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:11:25):**  And if we do, we have incredibly well-developed prefrontal cortexes.  
**[1:11:33-1:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:11:33):**  We have to come back to what you were saying earlier and to kind of put a capstone on it.  
**[1:11:38-1:11:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:11:38):**  You don't do permaculture, but you use it within what you do.  
**[1:11:42-1:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:11:42):**  So what would a financial system look like that actually was able to understand these  
**[1:11:50-1:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:11:50):**  negative externalities and turn them into positive externalities?  
**[1:11:53-1:11:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:11:53):**  What would that look like?  
**[1:11:55-1:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:11:55):**  And how would we build that?  
**[1:11:56-1:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:11:56):**  And how many people will be required for that?  
**[1:12:00-1:12:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:12:00):**  And so that's what Fifth World's going to do.  
**[1:12:01-1:12:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:12:01):**  And we're going to figure out how to objectively measure the proxies that we can in a remote  
**[1:12:09-1:12:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:12:09):**  way and incentivize land managers for doing the right thing.  
**[1:12:15-1:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:12:15):**  If we get that right, things will change very quickly.  
**[1:12:19-1:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:12:19):**  Now, I know it's still a little bit early to get into the details on this, but what  
**[1:12:24-1:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:12:24):**  can you tell me about how this company works and how it's going to move finance into that  
**[1:12:28-1:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:12:28):**  sector to incentivize these people who have power over land management?  
**[1:12:33-1:12:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:12:33):**  So all the money is sitting in the economy right now, and we've seen how much money can  
**[1:12:39-1:12:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:12:39):**  flow into Bitcoin, which is a decentralized protocol that allows people to own their value.  
**[1:12:45-1:12:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:12:45):**  So Bitcoin works by, it's literally just a virus.  
**[1:12:49-1:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:12:49):**  So some guy came up, we don't know who, came up with a protocol that says whoever solves  
**[1:12:55-1:13:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:12:55):**  problems, solves, figures out where the next prime number is, gets a Bitcoin.  
**[1:13:01-1:13:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:13:01):**  And the person that does it fastest is the one that gets the most Bitcoin.  
**[1:13:04-1:13:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:13:04):**  So he created a problem and a whole bunch of people created a decentralized network  
**[1:13:08-1:13:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:13:08):**  to create a solution.  
**[1:13:10-1:13:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:13:10):**  And then in order to operate the transactions on that Bitcoin network, you need a bunch  
**[1:13:14-1:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:13:14):**  of people that are holding the ledger.  
**[1:13:17-1:13:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:13:17):**  A ledger is just like a paper ledger, except it's a digital ledger.  
**[1:13:21-1:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:13:21):**  And so Bitcoin allows any person that can get access to a computer and has access to  
**[1:13:28-1:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:13:28):**  the internet to own their value.  
**[1:13:32-1:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:13:32):**  Most of the time we are price takers.  
**[1:13:36-1:13:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:13:36):**  So if you're an electrician or you're a carpenter or you're an engineer, you have to go out  
**[1:13:41-1:13:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:13:41):**  into the general market and you, there's some ability to market yourself and to choose different  
**[1:13:49-1:13:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:13:49):**  options.  
**[1:13:51-1:13:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:13:51):**  But generally we're price takers and most of the money, almost all of the money that  
**[1:13:56-1:14:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:13:56):**  we get access to has been minted as a result of a debt based system.  
**[1:14:01-1:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:14:01):**  And so money comes into existence by central banks through the creation of debt.  
**[1:14:06-1:14:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:14:06):**  Debt is created when somebody promises to buy a mortgage or buy a car.  
**[1:14:11-1:14:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:14:11):**  And so if you project that system out far enough, if the big banks are only generating  
**[1:14:17-1:14:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:14:17):**  the principal and they're not creating the interest, then there's really only one way  
**[1:14:21-1:14:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:14:21):**  for that system to exist, which is that you have to have perpetual growth.  
**[1:14:25-1:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:14:25):**  You have to have, I mean, this is a very long conversation about how money creation works.  
**[1:14:30-1:14:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:14:30):**  The end game is that the people that create the money are able to make all the rules because  
**[1:14:36-1:14:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:14:36):**  they create all the money.  
**[1:14:37-1:14:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:14:37):**  And we know that the bank of Canada, for example, is not a sovereign bank.  
**[1:14:42-1:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:14:42):**  And we know that the federal reserve is not a sovereign bank.  
**[1:14:45-1:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:14:45):**  These are, there's a banking cartel in this world.  
**[1:14:47-1:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:14:47):**  It's not a conspiracy theory.  
**[1:14:48-1:14:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:14:48):**  You can do lots of research on this.  
**[1:14:51-1:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:14:51):**  And so they're the ones that we've entrusted with the keys of money creation.  
**[1:14:55-1:15:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:14:55):**  Then our world will go in the direction that they deem to be the right direction.  
**[1:15:01-1:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:15:01):**  What Bitcoin does is it says, well, everybody can create money.  
**[1:15:04-1:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:15:04):**  Anybody that can solve a computer program has the ability to generate money in the form  
**[1:15:08-1:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:15:08):**  of Bitcoins.  
**[1:15:10-1:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:15:10):**  And every different cryptocurrency on planet earth has a different way of mining.  
**[1:15:15-1:15:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:15:15):**  So mining is the act of generating value.  
**[1:15:20-1:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:15:20):**  And so for Bitcoin, it's generating or solving prime numbers.  
**[1:15:27-1:15:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:15:27):**  There's a cryptocurrency called Siacoin and Siacoin is a competitor to Amazon web services.  
**[1:15:33-1:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:15:33):**  And the way it works is that instead of having all your files stored in a centralized Amazon  
**[1:15:38-1:15:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:15:38):**  data center, now every computer on planet earth can participate in a decentralized file  
**[1:15:45-1:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:15:45):**  storage mechanism and whoever hosts those files get paid in Siacoin.  
**[1:15:51-1:15:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:15:51):**  And Siacoin is traded on exchanges and you can exchange Siacoins for US dollars or for  
**[1:15:56-1:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:15:56):**  Bitcoins or for Ethereum tokens.  
**[1:16:01-1:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:16:01):**  And so now all of a sudden we don't have to operate only in the Fiat, which is basically  
**[1:16:09-1:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:16:09):**  money is given value by decree.  
**[1:16:12-1:16:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:16:12):**  It's not backed by silver or gold.  
**[1:16:15-1:16:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:16:15):**  And so we have the ability to generate our own value using our own infrastructure.  
**[1:16:20-1:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:16:20):**  And it's not contingent upon what the central banks say is the only legal tender within  
**[1:16:27-1:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:16:27):**  the country.  
**[1:16:28-1:16:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:16:28):**  And this is why the finance system right now is in its Kodak moment.  
**[1:16:34-1:16:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:16:34):**  We are actually witnessing a war right now between the centralized finance mechanism  
**[1:16:41-1:16:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:16:41):**  on earth and the decentralized finance mechanism on earth.  
**[1:16:45-1:16:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:16:45):**  And that's a whole other podcast right there.  
**[1:16:49-1:16:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:16:49):**  And so our token is going to instead of giving people the opportunity to mine Bitcoins by  
**[1:16:58-1:17:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:16:58):**  solving prime numbers, we are going to solve complex ecosystem service problems.  
**[1:17:04-1:17:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:17:04):**  And the people that solve those problems are going to be our miners.  
**[1:17:07-1:17:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:17:07):**  They're going to be farmers, they're going to be land managers.  
**[1:17:10-1:17:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:17:10):**  And if they solve a really hard problem or they improve a system in a specific way, they're  
**[1:17:15-1:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:17:15):**  going to be renumerated for that.  
**[1:17:18-1:17:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:17:18):**  And we're going to do it in an objective way that's based in science and as I said, objective  
**[1:17:22-1:17:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:17:22):**  so that we can measure it and say that it's real.  
**[1:17:26-1:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:17:26):**  And that will likely attract companies that have ESG requirements, so environmental stewardship  
**[1:17:33-1:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:17:33):**  and governance.  
**[1:17:34-1:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:17:34):**  So when a company like Shell or, you know, Barrick Gold or whatever, goes out and does  
**[1:17:42-1:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:17:42):**  their thing, they promise their shareholders that, yes, we make some messes when we're  
**[1:17:46-1:17:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:17:46):**  out in the world, but we're going to set aside a certain amount of money to make things right.  
**[1:17:50-1:17:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:17:50):**  Those are called ESGs.  
**[1:17:52-1:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:17:52):**  And so their shareholders might come and say, well, we want to ensure that you're not just  
**[1:17:59-1:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:17:59):**  putting lip service to these ESGs, that they actually mean something.  
**[1:18:02-1:18:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:18:02):**  And so every token created will have an objective measure of what it actually did for an ecosystem.  
**[1:18:08-1:18:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:18:08):**  So now that there is a trustworthy, verifiable benefit as a result of something happening  
**[1:18:16-1:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:18:16):**  on planet Earth, and there's a lot of greenwashing going on right now with GHG credits, there's  
**[1:18:21-1:18:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:18:21):**  a lot of greenwashing going on with all sorts of different verification programs.  
**[1:18:30-1:18:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:18:30):**  And so we need to raise the level because like, yes, I could just build something that  
**[1:18:35-1:18:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:18:35):**  makes me a whole pile of money and greenwashes, which is what a lot of people are doing.  
**[1:18:40-1:18:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:18:40):**  But I have, I'm self-interested as an individual, but I'm also self-interested in with regards  
**[1:18:49-1:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:18:49):**  to, this comes back to the end of our conversation, with regards to what kind of a planet I'm  
**[1:18:53-1:18:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:18:53):**  leaving for my kin and my neighbours and their kin.  
**[1:18:59-1:19:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:18:59):**  Because I better be thinking about my neighbours as well, because my neighbours have to live  
**[1:19:02-1:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:19:02):**  with my kids.  
**[1:19:03-1:19:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:19:03):**  And so it's in my best interest to make sure that they're taken care of at the same time.  
**[1:19:09-1:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:19:09):**  And so we're going to use our token to help incentivise that regeneration.  
**[1:19:18-1:19:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:19:18):**  Amazing, man.  
**[1:19:20-1:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:19:20):**  This is really exciting stuff.  
**[1:19:22-1:19:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:19:22):**  And like you said, this can be easily its own podcast in itself.  
**[1:19:25-1:19:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:19:25):**  So when you are ready to unveil this whole thing and start to put it out there and start  
**[1:19:29-1:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:19:29):**  some calls to action, I trust you'll get in touch with me and we'll do a follow up.  
**[1:19:33-1:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:19:33):**  But until then, how can people reach out to you, learn more about the resources that you  
**[1:19:37-1:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:19:37):**  have out there and get in touch?  
**[1:19:39-1:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:19:39):**  So Fifth World doesn't actually have a website right now.  
**[1:19:42-1:19:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:19:42):**  I'm building it as we speak.  
**[1:19:46-1:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:19:46):**  Right now, Verge Permaculture is being run by Michelle, my wife.  
**[1:19:50-1:19:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:19:50):**  And so that's the best way to stay in touch.  
**[1:19:52-1:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:19:52):**  Yeah, I mean, for people that want to get on this, this tidal wave that we're hoping  
**[1:19:59-1:20:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:19:59):**  to create, get your PDC.  
**[1:20:02-1:20:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:20:02):**  There's lots of people out there that are teaching them and start getting educated in  
**[1:20:07-1:20:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:20:07):**  what it actually means to be doing permaculture.  
**[1:20:11-1:20:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:20:11):**  And you probably want to take a couple of them because every teacher teaches it a slightly  
**[1:20:14-1:20:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:20:14):**  different way and they have different biases and different ways of explaining things and  
**[1:20:20-1:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:20:20):**  go out there and start getting educated and start doing stuff, even if it's a small garden  
**[1:20:26-1:20:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:20:26):**  in your backyard, a solar around your house, insulating your building, like learn what  
**[1:20:31-1:20:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:20:31):**  it means to take control of your supply chains.  
**[1:20:34-1:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:20:34):**  And if you don't want to get involved in the world, that's fine.  
**[1:20:38-1:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:20:38):**  Do it for yourself.  
**[1:20:40-1:20:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:20:40):**  We are literally witnessing the disintegration.  
**[1:20:44-1:20:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:20:44):**  So not like we have an integrated civilization right now.  
**[1:20:49-1:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:20:49):**  It's somewhat integrated.  
**[1:20:50-1:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:20:50):**  It's disintegrating right now for lots of reasons.  
**[1:20:55-1:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:20:55):**  And so if you like to eat and stay warm, I have a great client right now that I'm working  
**[1:20:59-1:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:20:59):**  for.  
**[1:21:01-1:21:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:21:01):**  And she said, you know, I love all the concepts of permaculture.  
**[1:21:05-1:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:21:05):**  It's fantastic.  
**[1:21:06-1:21:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:21:06):**  We're trying to get to her values and visions.  
**[1:21:08-1:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:21:08):**  She said, you know, I want to do what's right for the planet, but still have hot showers.  
**[1:21:14-1:21:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:21:14):**  And that's what permaculture lets us to do.  
**[1:21:17-1:21:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:21:17):**  It takes away the guilt.  
**[1:21:18-1:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:21:18):**  It allows you to have the skills to be able to understand how you fit within planet Earth.  
**[1:21:24-1:21:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:21:24):**  You are not a virus or intrinsically destructive.  
**[1:21:28-1:21:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:21:28):**  We just need to get the design right.  
**[1:21:30-1:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:21:30):**  And so there's so many reasons to go out and take a PDC, get started today.  
**[1:21:36-1:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:21:36):**  And yeah, we'll have a fifth world website up within the not too distant future.  
**[1:21:40-1:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:21:40):**  And I'm sure Oliver and I will be having another conversation as well when that happens.  
**[1:21:46-1:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:21:46):**  Absolutely.  
**[1:21:47-1:21:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:21:47):**  And yeah, I really like on that closing note that you said that this really opens up the  
**[1:21:51-1:21:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:21:51):**  possibility for taking the guilt out of the things that you enjoy.  
**[1:21:55-1:22:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:21:55):**  I really like when doing good by the planet is not framed as some sort of austerity, but  
**[1:22:02-1:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:22:02):**  rather this is the abundance that we can be living in because we are dependent on the  
**[1:22:05-1:22:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:22:05):**  systems that support us.  
**[1:22:07-1:22:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:22:07):**  This is a great place to put a little bookmark in it and we'll continue on the next session.  
**[1:22:11-1:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:22:11):**  Rob, it's always a pleasure to talk to you.  
**[1:22:13-1:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:22:13):**  Thank you so much.  
**[1:22:14-1:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/rob-avis-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-in-designing-for-small-spaces/#t=1:22:14):**  Yeah, thanks, Bud.

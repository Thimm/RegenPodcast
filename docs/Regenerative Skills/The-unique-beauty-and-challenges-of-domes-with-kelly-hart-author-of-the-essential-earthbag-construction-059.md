**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:01:48):**  We both share our own stories of success and challenges in building and living in domes,

**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:02:00):**  on your lifestyle and some of the simple habits you can change to make the biggest positive

**[0:02:11-0:02:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:02:11):**  Hey Kelly, thank you so much for joining us today.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:02:14):**  How you doing?  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:02:15):**  I'm doing fine Oliver, how are you?  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:02:17):**  I'm doing fantastic.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:02:18):**  We just got done building the goat house up on our farm today.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:02:21):**  What have you been up to?  
**[0:02:22-0:02:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:02:22):**  I'm working on a sculptor, a sculptural project, carving some wood.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:02:29):**  It's a sculpture of mitochondrial ease.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:02:34):**  Very cool.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:02:35):**  Man, I'll have to see pictures of that sometime.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:02:36):**  But hey, look, I've got a ton of questions that I'd love to ask you.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:02:39):**  So what do you say we just jump right in?  
**[0:02:41-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:02:41):**  Sounds good to me.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:02:42):**  All right.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:02:43):**  So before we get into kind of the nuts and bolts of our questions, could you tell me  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:02:46):**  a little bit about your background, how you got started, especially in natural building  
**[0:02:51-0:02:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:02:51):**  and in sustainable living practice?  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:02:53):**  I have been building things all of my life, basically, even when I was a kid.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:02:59):**  My dad was into building projects around the house and I would always help him.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:03:07):**  So I learned a lot from him.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:03:09):**  He was a carpenter himself.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:03:12):**  And so I always tagged along with him and learned quite a bit.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:03:19):**  He had a workshop, a woodworking shop.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:03:23):**  So as I grew up, I spent a lot of time helping with various projects and earning some money,  
**[0:03:32-0:03:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:03:32):**  you know, like we had a lathe and we built various projects in his shop.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:03:39):**  And then as I matured, I continued working with carpentry and dwellings and almost anything.  
**[0:03:53-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:03:53):**  I have always been very project oriented and continue to be into my 70s.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:04:02):**  So I would say that it's been a lifelong journey of interest in building and I focused more  
**[0:04:13-0:04:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:04:13):**  on sustainable and green concepts as I got older and I started making films fairly early  
**[0:04:31-0:04:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:04:31):**  on.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:04:32):**  I have a long background in photography and filmmaking.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:04:35):**  And at a certain point, a couple of decades ago, I decided to make a documentary film  
**[0:04:43-0:04:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:04:43):**  or videotape at that point about sustainable architecture and focus on natural building.  
**[0:04:53-0:05:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:04:53):**  And I made a program that's called a journey of sustainable homes and in the process of  
**[0:05:06-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:05:06):**  doing that, I just got more and more interested in all the different ways that you could build,  
**[0:05:13-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:05:13):**  including earth bags was one of the concepts that I introduced in that video.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:05:20):**  And so when I had an opportunity to actually build with earth bags on some properties that  
**[0:05:30-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:05:30):**  I bought, I took that opportunity and got my hands into the building project itself.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:05:40):**  That's a remarkable backstory.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:05:41):**  I wish I had had more access to that kind of education when I was younger.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:05:45):**  I might have leaped forward in my building abilities much faster.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:05:49):**  Now what caused you to pick earth bags out of all of the different options for natural  
**[0:05:54-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:05:54):**  materials available to you?  
**[0:05:56-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:05:56):**  Well, it just kind of fascinated me.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:05:59):**  It seems so versatile and so inexpensive ultimately.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:06:07):**  And it provides an opportunity to build projects that are really quite sustainable in terms  
**[0:06:18-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:06:18):**  of the kinds of materials that you use.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:06:22):**  Many designs and especially domes can be built without any or very little wood and manufactured  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:06:35):**  materials beyond the bag material and a little bit of barbed wire.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:06:40):**  Everything else is just earthen based.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:06:43):**  And so that's what I did when I had that opportunity to build was to actually work with earth bags  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:06:52):**  and build a whole series of domes that I combined into my personal home.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:06:58):**  Now I've seen pictures of the amazing earth bag sort of hybrid structure where you live.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:07:03):**  Could you tell us about some of the advantages of dome dwellings as well as some of your  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:07:07):**  personal observations from living in one from so many years?  
**[0:07:12-0:07:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:07:12):**  Well first of all, my experience of living in a dome was just really rewarding.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:07:21):**  And it's interesting that when people would come to visit, they would almost the first  
**[0:07:26-0:07:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:07:26):**  thing they would do is take in a deep breath and you'd hear them say, oh, this really feels  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:07:37):**  good to be in this space because you feel surrounded.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:07:41):**  You have a, it's an organic, very motherly, embracing quality that emanates from a dome.  
**[0:07:53-0:08:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:07:53):**  And I think that's partly because you don't have all those rectilinear shapes with the

**[0:08:03-0:08:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:08:03):**  And so that was one of my experiences.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:08:08):**  I knew that domes have actually, one of the truths about domes is that they can encompass  
**[0:08:19-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:08:19):**  more volume of space than any other shape in terms of the amount of shell area.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:08:32):**  In other words, they're very efficient in terms of the use of materials to enclose a

**[0:08:41-0:08:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:08:41):**  And that attracted me.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:08:44):**  And then I really liked the idea that I could build something with local natural materials  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:08:55):**  and very little industrial materials included.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:09:00):**  Now I know there are a lot of other ways that domes can be built with other natural materials.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:09:06):**  Could you go through some of the ones that you're more familiar with?  
**[0:09:09-0:09:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:09:09):**  Well, I know that domes have a very questionable reputation.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:09:21):**  They were heavily promoted back in the early 70s, and mostly geodesic domes at that point.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:09:30):**  And for some of the same reasons I just mentioned.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:09:33):**  But it soon became apparent that they are notoriously leaky.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:09:40):**  And that has to do with all the different, with the geodesic dome, all the different  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:09:45):**  facets that come together.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:09:49):**  Every time you have a different plane that connects, you have a place where potential  
**[0:09:55-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:09:55):**  leaks can occur and a separation of the uniformity or the monolithic quality of the dome can  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:10:07):**  cause leak problems.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:10:11):**  Now that isn't necessarily true with earthbag domes, but there are other issues with leaking  
**[0:10:20-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:10:20):**  with earthbag domes.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:10:21):**  And then other kinds of domes, there's a lot of interest in what's called monolithic domes.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:10:30):**  These are basically ferrocement domes that you create the shell over a metal framework,  
**[0:10:41-0:10:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:10:41):**  and usually the concrete is sprayed with a machine.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:10:48):**  And so it's a highly industrial process.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:10:51):**  And one that is not particularly sustainable, even though once you've created the dome that  
**[0:10:59-0:11:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:10:59):**  way, it can be very efficient and will last a long time.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:11:07):**  So it has some advantages.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:11:09):**  But monolithic domes are often promoted as one of the strongest kinds of forms.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:11:19):**  You can almost picture a car driving up on the back of one of these and still being supported.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:11:26):**  So those are the primary modes or types of domes that I'm familiar with.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:11:33):**  Yeah, those are the ones that I have most seen around the different natural structures  
**[0:11:37-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:11:37):**  that I have visited.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:11:39):**  There's actually quite a few earthen or earthbag domes or ferrocement domes that I visited  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:11:44):**  even around here on Lake Atitlan in Guatemala.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:11:47):**  And I've seen just as many of them covered over with a tarp or even with a secondary  
**[0:11:53-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:11:53):**  roof on top because of those problems that you've talked about.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:11:56):**  I also see all the time on forums for natural building that that leaking problem that you

**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:12:08):**  and most talked about issues on those platforms.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:12:12):**  So what are some of the solutions that you found for protecting natural domes and vaults,  
**[0:12:17-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:12:17):**  especially without necessarily resulting or I guess overusing cement?  
**[0:12:24-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:12:24):**  Because I know that there are a few other ways, but they all seem to be somewhat inadequate  
**[0:12:31-0:12:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:12:31):**  depending on the conditions of the exterior climate.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:12:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:12:35):**  And the climate is really essential for evaluating the appropriateness of building domes with  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:12:44):**  particularly with earthbags.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:12:48):**  Earthbag domes were heavily promoted in the early days, a couple of decades ago.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:12:54):**  Nader Khalili at his earthen institute in California, he was building almost entirely

**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:13:08):**  He called it Super Adobe.

**[0:13:20-0:13:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:13:20):**  can leak.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:13:22):**  And fortunately, in a way, it didn't become a tremendously structural problem in that  
**[0:13:33-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:13:33):**  it would cause an unstable structure that could fall in on you because he tended to  
**[0:13:44-0:13:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:13:44):**  fill in the earthbags that was modified with cement so that it would form a very solid  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:13:54):**  block and even if it got damp, it wouldn't deform.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:13:59):**  But these kinds of domes might still leak and the problem stems from the fact that inherently  
**[0:14:07-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:14:07):**  a dome or a vault has no other roof structure.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:14:15):**  The walls and the roof are all one unit.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:14:22):**  So that if the weather is damp, there's no option for that rain but to fall on the

**[0:14:38-0:14:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:14:38):**  And that means that unlike most wall systems and roof systems where you have the option  
**[0:14:48-0:14:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:14:48):**  of an eave that goes over the material, like if you've got a straw bale or a cob or even  
**[0:14:57-0:15:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:14:57):**  a stone wall, you can create a nice big eave that goes over that that protects the wall  
**[0:15:04-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:15:04):**  and the materials in it.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:15:06):**  But with earthbags, you don't have that option.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:15:10):**  You don't have a separate roof over it.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:15:14):**  So you have to rely on the skin of the earthbag dome structure or any dome structure requires  
**[0:15:26-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:15:26):**  a rely on the skin to keep any moisture from migrating through.

**[0:15:48-0:16:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:15:48):**  The truth is that there's really no good solution to a guaranteed dry earthbag dome over time  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:16:02):**  in a very damp climate.

**[0:16:15-0:16:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:16:15):**  really only be built in fairly arid climates, like probably no more than 15 inches of precipitation  
**[0:16:28-0:16:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:16:28):**  a year.

**[0:17:34-0:17:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:17:34):**  to dry out and moisture can accumulate under and people might not even know it.

**[0:18:41-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:18:41):**  I actually went to go see a vault, which is basically just an arced ceiling made with  
**[0:18:48-0:18:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:18:48):**  earth while I was working in Senegal with this wonderful friend of mine who had one

**[0:18:59-0:19:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:18:59):**  And after two seasons, they had too many problems with leakages and they literally built a house  
**[0:19:05-0:19:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:19:05):**  around their house with a full roof, adobe walls and everything that encased their original

**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:19:16):**  And quite frankly, if you're building a house around your house, I don't know even if you're  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:19:21):**  using natural materials, if you've really done the most eco-friendly or environmentally

**[0:19:33-0:19:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:19:33):**  using.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:19:34):**  I totally agree with you and that is an option.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:19:38):**  If somebody really wants an earthbag dome, then you can build a separate roof over that  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:19:45):**  sheds the water away and people have done that.

**[0:19:54-0:19:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:19:54):**  you're just using that many more material.  
**[0:19:56-0:19:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:19:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:57-0:19:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:19:57):**  Now I've stayed in a couple of domes as well.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:19:59):**  In fact, I did a portion of my natural building apprenticeship with Carol Cruz in the Tres

**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:20:09):**  And I mean, most people would consider that to be a fairly dry climate, though they do  
**[0:20:12-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:20:12):**  get about two or three months of thunderstorms in the afternoons and such, and it can snow  
**[0:20:18-0:20:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:20:18):**  significantly during the winter.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:20:21):**  And that was eventually covered over with an acrylic sheeting because for the same reason,  
**[0:20:26-0:20:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:20:26):**  the leaks just kept coming.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:20:28):**  And both of these examples that I just gave are in fairly dry climates.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:20:33):**  It might not quite make it within that 15 inches per year rainfall threshold that you  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:20:38):**  were talking about, but definitely a lot drier than the applications we have here in Guatemala,  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:20:43):**  where we get on average of about 85 centimeters of rain per year.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:20:47):**  So I think it's really just a matter of designing and building for the correct context for your  
**[0:20:56-0:20:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:20:56):**  climate and your ecology.  
**[0:20:57-0:20:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:20:57):**  Wouldn't you agree?  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:20:59):**  I certainly do agree.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:21:02):**  The earthbag building, the home that I built, was actually not too far from Taos, New Mexico.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:21:07):**  It was in southern Colorado, above there, at a somewhat higher elevation.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:21:12):**  And the average rainfall there was about 12 inches per year.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:21:20):**  And I built a whole series of domes and combined them together.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:21:24):**  And it was a different kind of situation in that I filled the earthbags with scoria, which  
**[0:21:31-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:21:31):**  is a crushed volcanic stone that's very lightweight and frothy and lots of voids in the stones,  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:21:40):**  which actually creates an insulating fill.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:21:45):**  And so in that climate, that was perfect.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:21:49):**  Then for a plaster over that, I experimented with papercrete, which is a repulped, recycled  
**[0:21:58-0:22:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:21:58):**  newsprint and cardboard and whatnot, mixed with a little bit of Portland cement, and  
**[0:22:04-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:22:04):**  then put on as a plaster.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:22:10):**  And that had some interesting qualities, too.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:22:14):**  It tended to add to the insulation.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:22:17):**  And also, papercrete has the ability to absorb a tremendous amount of moisture, like a sponge.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:22:26):**  And so whenever it precipitated, the papercrete on the outside would absorb all the moisture,  
**[0:22:36-0:22:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:22:36):**  and none of it would ever migrate into the earthbag structure beneath it.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:22:44):**  And I wasn't concerned really about the earthbag fill getting saturated with moisture anyway,  
**[0:22:54-0:23:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:22:54):**  because with the volcanic stone, there's no potential for deformation or rot or anything  
**[0:23:01-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:23:01):**  of that sort.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:23:02):**  And as a matter of fact, I never, in the many years that I lived in that earthbag dome house,  
**[0:23:09-0:23:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:23:09):**  I never saw any moisture or leaks coming through to the inside of the building.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:23:16):**  And eventually, I decided to put a concrete, not concrete, but a cement-based stucco as  
**[0:23:30-0:23:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:23:30):**  a thin shell over the papercrete, because the papercrete wasn't strong enough, robust  
**[0:23:38-0:23:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:23:38):**  enough to weather very well.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:23:40):**  It was starting to get ruined.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:23:42):**  And so eventually, that building was stuccoed, and that's how it is now.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:23:50):**  And I built that about two decades ago, and it still hasn't changed at all.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:23:58):**  I mean, it's still a very viable structure.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:24:03):**  That's fantastic.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:24:04):**  Yeah, I'm always glad to hear when someone has made a successful model of domes, because  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:24:08):**  they are really aesthetically pleasing structures.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:24:12):**  And there's a lot of benefits in lifestyle and comfort levels that you can get from them.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:24:18):**  But aside from those other troubleshooting and difficulties in the building and the maintenance  
**[0:24:25-0:24:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:24:25):**  process, I think they're fantastic otherwise.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:24:28):**  Now, I know that you've been promoting sustainable building and design for a long time, and you've

**[0:25:01-0:25:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:25:01):**  that earthbag domed house.

**[0:36:52-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-xzmogh2g479mqg866e0v765lb804l6/#t=0:36:52):**  Publishing and from Amazon.

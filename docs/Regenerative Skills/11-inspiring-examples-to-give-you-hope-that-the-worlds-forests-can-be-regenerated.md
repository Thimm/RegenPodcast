**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:36:02):**  the time to tell me a little bit about how he propagates native trees and takes care  
**[0:36:06-0:36:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:36:06):**  of them to make sure that they get established and continue to reproduce.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:36:10):**  So our nurseries basically we're not buying trees and we're not buying seed.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:36:16):**  That's what happens most of the time is most people are planting trees that are not from  
**[0:36:20-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:36:20):**  the area or are reforesting with non-native species.

**[0:36:33-0:36:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:36:33):**  you disrupt a little bit if not a lot the system.

**[0:36:45-0:36:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:36:45):**  from our forests, we're making our own nurseries and fortunately the species that we have in  
**[0:36:53-0:37:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:36:53):**  our native forest there which are cloud forests, we're at 2100 meters elevation.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:37:00):**  So I guess not sure what that is in feet but I'm guessing it's like 8,000 feet or something  
**[0:37:06-0:37:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:37:06):**  like that.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:37:07):**  Maybe yeah something like that.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:37:10):**  But basically the species that we have in that native forest are species that put water  
**[0:37:16-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:37:16):**  into the ground and not suck water out of the ground like eucalyptus or pine forests  
**[0:37:23-0:37:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:37:23):**  and cypress which that's what most people plant in this area but unfortunately they're  
**[0:37:29-0:37:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:37:29):**  great lumber but they instead of putting water in the ground they're drying the ground up

**[0:37:49-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:37:49):**  in that area because those are great trees from even much higher elevation in areas where  
**[0:37:53-0:37:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:37:53):**  there's less biodiversity so those would do well but in our area which is a cloud forest  
**[0:37:57-0:38:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:37:57):**  which has lots of biodiversity if you plant a monocrop of those trees you get rid of too  
**[0:38:03-0:38:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:38:03):**  many species so it's better to plant the local ones which retain more variety.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:38:14):**  Now a bit more similar to Alex's approach of taking a more active role in planting trees,

**[0:44:46-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:44:46):**  can have their role.

**[0:44:53-0:45:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:44:53):**  than a couple of hectares monoculture sites.

**[0:45:05-0:45:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:45:05):**  So if someone comes with that proposal and I had that a number of times where they want  
**[0:45:08-0:45:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:45:08):**  to plant eucalyptus and pine trees recently we checked it.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:45:13):**  We want our partners to plant native tree species from the region and we allow for 10  
**[0:45:20-0:45:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:45:20):**  percent exotics and the 10 percent exotics are normally the smallholder root lots that  
**[0:45:25-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:45:25):**  I just talked about or fruit trees in agroforestry systems.

**[0:45:35-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:45:35):**  for us.

**[0:45:42-0:45:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:45:42):**  There is we have a project this is actually in Peru.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:45:45):**  They work in the high Andes and they found it very difficult in their first year to get

**[0:45:58-0:45:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:45:58):**  pines.

**[0:46:06-0:46:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:46:06):**  70 percent.

**[0:46:10-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:46:10):**  So for the rest we want we want native trees to be planted.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:46:15):**  And this is also what is needed.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:46:19):**  You know I think these are the most unlucky of all the trees in the world.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:46:29):**  They get they get cut down every day at an enormous rate because their timber is valuable  
**[0:46:35-0:46:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:46:35):**  or because they apparently stand in the way for soy or palm oil plantations.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:46:43):**  And also no one is actually there's not many organizations having them in the nurseries  
**[0:46:47-0:46:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:46:47):**  because they don't have very much of commercial value.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:46:49):**  Yet for the local ecosystem they are just this skeleton there.  
**[0:46:54-0:46:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:46:54):**  You know forests are the most diverse.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:46:57):**  Most of the biodiversity on the planet lives in forests.

**[0:47:05-0:47:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:47:05):**  Yet we're turning them at an enormous rate and no one has the expertise on how to grow  
**[0:47:08-0:47:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:47:08):**  them back.

**[0:47:18-0:47:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:47:18):**  Matadlantica is one of the biggest contributors to this.

**[0:47:28-0:47:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:47:28):**  And that is that's a principal point that we want.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:47:32):**  We want our money to be used for this kind of things.

**[0:47:43-0:47:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:47:43):**  how we can restore some of these ecosystems that we have been destroying.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:47:47):**  There's not there's not much people who know that.

**[0:48:11-0:48:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:48:11):**  with corn.

**[0:48:42-0:48:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:48:42):**  about you know more plantations of pine eucalyptus.

**[0:58:35-0:58:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:58:35):**  came down, if they didn't jay inside, I've got a very cheap, big container.

**[0:59:30-0:59:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:59:30):**  That's really a mantra that I like to push because if you think, well, I don't have this  
**[0:59:38-0:59:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:59:38):**  and I don't have that and I don't have the land and I don't have...  
**[0:59:42-0:59:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:59:42):**  And you put all kinds of reasons why you can't, while just focus on, I say, start with two  
**[0:59:50-0:59:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:59:50):**  trios.  
**[0:59:51-0:59:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:59:51):**  You say, well, I'm living in a suburb or I'm living in the city and I don't have much room.  
**[0:59:56-0:59:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:59:56):**  Do you have room for six trees?  
**[0:59:59-1:00:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:59:59):**  And it may be just six shrubs.  
**[1:00:01-1:00:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:00:01):**  You can do trios with shrubs.  
**[1:00:03-1:00:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:00:03):**  And so just start, get some trees in, get two trios because two trios work really well.  
**[1:00:10-1:00:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:00:10):**  If you just put in three trees, then none of the trees may have the ability to get pollinated  
**[1:00:16-1:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:00:16):**  and therefore you'll think, well, it doesn't produce.  
**[1:00:18-1:00:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:00:18):**  Well, it doesn't produce because you only have one of each of the trees.  
**[1:00:23-1:00:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:00:23):**  So two trios guarantees that you'll have, well, it doesn't guarantee, but it makes it  
**[1:00:27-1:00:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:00:27):**  far more likely that you'll have good pollination and you'll have a good start.  
**[1:00:32-1:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:00:32):**  And you'll learn just as much with two trios as you would with 200 trees.  
**[1:00:39-1:00:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:00:39):**  So that's the key is if you can start, and those of you who are listening who are further  
**[1:00:44-1:00:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:00:44):**  south, you still have a planting season.  
**[1:00:47-1:00:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:00:47):**  You may still be able to plant where the ground is totally frozen here and this planting season  
**[1:00:53-1:00:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:00:53):**  is well over.  
**[1:00:54-1:01:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:00:54):**  But if you can start this fall, even this weekend, go out and just put in six trees,  
**[1:01:01-1:01:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:01:01):**  start with that and then gradually you'll diversify, add a couple of shrubs for each  
**[1:01:06-1:01:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:01:06):**  tree and fruiting shrubs.  
**[1:01:07-1:01:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:01:07):**  So you'll have your collection.  
**[1:01:10-1:01:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:01:10):**  And what I like to say is if you start that way, now that's not a huge investment, putting  
**[1:01:15-1:01:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:01:15):**  in six trees and let's say 12 shrubs and company that by some perennials, you may put in for  
**[1:01:23-1:01:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:01:23):**  $500 and say, well, you know, that's a lot of money.  
**[1:01:27-1:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:01:27):**  Well, $500 is really not a lot of money compared to putting in an orchard of a few hundred  
**[1:01:33-1:01:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:01:33):**  trees.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:01:34):**  But when you have these six trees going and the shrubs underneath and some perennials  
**[1:01:41-1:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:01:41):**  in two years, the plants that really are happy and I like to say happy because a plant that's  
**[1:01:47-1:01:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:01:47):**  happy will double every year.  
**[1:01:49-1:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:01:49):**  So in two years, you will probably get to a point where you can multiply your existing  
**[1:01:57-1:01:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:01:57):**  plants by 10.  
**[1:01:59-1:02:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:01:59):**  That's where it gets interesting.  
**[1:02:00-1:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:02:00):**  You say, well, I don't know how to do that.  
**[1:02:02-1:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:02:02):**  Well, in two years you will have plenty of time to learn how.  
**[1:02:06-1:02:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:02:06):**  And so you'll be able to do some propagation.  
**[1:02:09-1:02:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:02:09):**  You'll be able to learn about taking cuttings.  
**[1:02:12-1:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:02:12):**  If you check out my YouTube channel, I got some nice little videos on propagating shrubs  
**[1:02:17-1:02:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:02:17):**  and a couple of easy techniques.  
**[1:02:20-1:02:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:02:20):**  And so those are ways that you can get started.  
**[1:02:24-1:02:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:02:24):**  Very relatively inexpensive.  
**[1:02:27-1:02:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:02:27):**  And then if you say, well, it'll give you the opportunity to grow.  
**[1:02:33-1:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:02:33):**  So if you say, well, I only put in two trios.  
**[1:02:35-1:02:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:02:35):**  Well, what's 10 times that?  
**[1:02:38-1:02:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:02:38):**  That's 12 trios.  
**[1:02:40-1:02:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:02:40):**  And then from there, so 12 trios times six, you're up to 72 trees.  
**[1:02:46-1:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:02:46):**  And then you can grow by another 10 times in another two years.  
**[1:02:50-1:02:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:02:50):**  So it's that kind of multiplication.  
**[1:02:52-1:02:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:02:52):**  You say, well, all I have room for is six trees and that's where I want to stay.  
**[1:02:57-1:02:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:02:57):**  Well, great.  
**[1:02:58-1:03:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:02:58):**  Then you can get started and have your yard producing in just a few years with two trios.  
**[1:03:06-1:03:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:03:06):**  So it's really that whole issue of starting.  
**[1:03:10-1:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:03:10):**  And I know, I mean, I'm talking to you about it, but I know because I had  
**[1:03:16-1:03:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:03:16):**  the dream and the idea of doing it, but I had this monoculture orchard and it really  
**[1:03:21-1:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:03:21):**  kept me for quite a few years from starting to replant the orchard the way I wanted.  
**[1:03:27-1:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:03:27):**  So just start, I should have started years ago with a lot less rather than trying to  
**[1:03:33-1:03:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:03:33):**  put in right away.  
**[1:03:35-1:03:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:03:35):**  We put in one acre and then we put in two and three and a half acres.  
**[1:03:42-1:03:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:03:42):**  So it's a lot more to think in that scale while you could start much smaller.  
**[1:03:50-1:03:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:03:50):**  And then you'll, at least if you start, you'll have the fruit that much earlier.  
**[1:03:55-1:04:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:03:55):**  And it's the time element that's really critical because the longer you delay, the longer you  
**[1:04:01-1:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:04:01):**  won't get to taste the fruit of your work.  
**[1:04:05-1:04:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:04:05):**  And that's where the change really happens.  
**[1:04:07-1:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:04:07):**  When you start to harvest, then you start to go, oh my gosh, the first year we harvested  
**[1:04:13-1:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:04:13):**  a few sweet cherries.  
**[1:04:15-1:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:04:15):**  I thought, why didn't I put in 50?  
**[1:04:20-1:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:04:20):**  Because it takes a few years for them to produce.  
**[1:04:22-1:04:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:04:22):**  And then when they did, I thought, wow, one tree, the birds come in, I eat everything.  
**[1:04:28-1:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:04:28):**  So that's another issue.

**[1:04:33-1:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:04:33):**  And so, okay.  
**[1:04:34-1:04:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:04:34):**  But at least I learned with that one and now I'm planning to put in more.  
**[1:04:40-1:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:04:40):**  But that's the progression.

**[1:04:56-1:05:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:04:56):**  agriculture for a second time on this show to help me understand one of the most important

**[1:05:25-1:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:05:25):**  Even though Southwest Wisconsin gets a decent amount of rain, about 30 inches a meter, thereabouts,  
**[1:05:32-1:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:05:32):**  of rain per year, there are times when it goes without.  
**[1:05:35-1:05:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:05:35):**  It was one year I went completely without rain.  
**[1:05:38-1:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:05:38):**  The second year went almost the whole year without rain.  
**[1:05:41-1:05:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:05:41):**  And so I wanted to make sure that we had adequate water stored in ponds and in the soil.  
**[1:05:48-1:05:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:05:48):**  And another example is Middle Tennessee and Kentucky this past calendar year, 2019.  
**[1:05:54-1:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:05:54):**  Two times the normal rainfall amount, like 80 inches, somewhat 80 inches of rain.  
**[1:05:59-1:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:05:59):**  However, in the middle of this year where they're getting twice the annual rainfall,  
**[1:06:04-1:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:06:04):**  they had the longest dry spell in history.

**[1:06:12-1:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:06:12):**  Well, so if we're having twice the rain and having these long dry spells, the water was  
**[1:06:17-1:06:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:06:17):**  there for continued agricultural production if it was captured, delivered to a place,

**[1:06:54-1:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:06:54):**  So the basic theory on which Miyawaki method works is called the theory of potential natural  
**[1:07:01-1:07:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:07:01):**  vegetation, PNV.  
**[1:07:03-1:07:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:07:03):**  The theory says that if a piece of land is deprived from human intervention, naturally  
**[1:07:09-1:07:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:07:09):**  a forest will come back on it.  
**[1:07:11-1:07:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:07:11):**  The first grasses will come, then small shrubs, then trees which are pioneer species, soft  
**[1:07:20-1:07:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:07:20):**  wood, fast growing trees.  
**[1:07:22-1:07:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:07:22):**  And then eventually trees which are slow growing like oak, they will start to appear and make  
**[1:07:30-1:07:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:07:30):**  a system which will keep on regenerating itself.  
**[1:07:33-1:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:07:33):**  That ecology won't change until probably the next ice age.  
**[1:07:39-1:07:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:07:39):**  This group of trees or group of species is called the climax forest species.  
**[1:07:44-1:07:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:07:44):**  So the first step we have to do is identify the potential natural vegetation of a particular  
**[1:07:49-1:07:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:07:49):**  place, segregate the climax forest species, and then plant a climax forest using the seedlings  
**[1:07:58-1:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:07:58):**  of seeds collected from another climax forest.  
**[1:08:02-1:08:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:08:02):**  So basically we are mimicking nature, but we are skipping the steps in which it will  
**[1:08:09-1:08:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:08:09):**  lead to climax forest finally, maybe after 200 years.  
**[1:08:13-1:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:08:13):**  So we are taking what would be the result of natural succession after 200 years and  
**[1:08:20-1:08:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:08:20):**  planting it on day one and creating a micro environment where the trees are at the same  
**[1:08:25-1:08:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:08:25):**  density at which they occur in the forest, like three to five plants per square meter.  
**[1:08:33-1:08:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:08:33):**  And that's incredibly dense compared to the way plantations happen or gardening happens.  
**[1:08:41-1:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:08:41):**  So this is another radical difference from conventional plantation that we plant super  
**[1:08:47-1:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:08:47):**  dense, so dense that you can't even walk into a Miyawaki forest.  
**[1:08:52-1:08:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:08:52):**  But that's exactly how the way a natural forest would be so dense that you can't even walk  
**[1:08:57-1:09:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:08:57):**  into it because of the dense vegetation under the canopy of big trees.  
**[1:09:01-1:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:09:01):**  So by planting densely, by planting only climax forest species of potential natural vegetation  
**[1:09:08-1:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:09:08):**  and by mimicking nature in a way that we make our soil as healthy and fertile as soil of  
**[1:09:16-1:09:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:09:16):**  a natural forest.  
**[1:09:17-1:09:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:09:17):**  It smells like a natural forest right on day one when we plant the forest.  
**[1:09:22-1:09:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:09:22):**  So we make sure that our soil is good at perforation of roots, perforation of water.  
**[1:09:29-1:09:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:09:29):**  It can retain the water, it can absorb it like a sponge.

**[1:09:55-1:10:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:09:55):**  a forest, a self-sustaining forest in just two to three years, which keeps on growing  
**[1:10:01-1:10:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:10:01):**  itself once even after we stop maintaining it.

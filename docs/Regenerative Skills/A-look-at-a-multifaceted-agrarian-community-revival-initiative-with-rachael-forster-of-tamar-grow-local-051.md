**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast. Here we dive deep into the worlds of permaculture,  
**[0:00:05-0:00:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:00:05):**  natural building, and regenerative living as we aspire to help you reach your highest  
**[0:00:09-0:00:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:00:09):**  potential for yourself, for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we all  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:00:13):**  share. As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher and I have a great session for you in this  
**[0:00:18-0:00:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:00:18):**  week's episode, so let's jump right in.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:00:29):**  Are you looking for the best resources to help you build a regenerative lifestyle?  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:00:34):**  New Society Publishers has been a leader in sustainable publishing for over 30 years.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:00:39):**  They publish good news and solutions for individuals and organizations seeking to change their  
**[0:00:43-0:00:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:00:43):**  lives so that they may change the world for the better.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:00:46):**  Their company mandate goes far beyond the single bottom line of profit. They care deeply  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:00:51):**  not only about what they publish, but also how they do business. They believe in the  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:00:55):**  authors that they take on and the works that they bring to the marketplace. From sustainable  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:00:59):**  living to progressive parenting, New Society Publishers has the books you need to help  
**[0:01:04-0:01:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:01:04):**  build a better world. Buy your print and ebooks online at www.newsociety.com or at fine bookstores  
**[0:01:12-0:01:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:01:12):**  near you.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:01:13):**  Alright, today I have a remarkable guest, Rachel Forster, who works for a cutting edge  
**[0:01:18-0:01:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:01:18):**  non-profit called Tamar Grow Local. Now normally I like to give an overview of the speaker  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:01:24):**  and their projects and expertise before the start of an interview, but though I tried  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:01:28):**  to do that, Rachel and Tamar Grow Local are both quite tricky to sum up. Their initiatives  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:01:33):**  and goals in the community are very far reaching and intricate, but what I can say is that  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:01:38):**  they've helped to make huge strides in promoting regenerative farming and market gardening  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:01:42):**  in the Tamar Valley, a historical farming region between Cornwall and Devon counties  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:01:47):**  in the southwest of England. With just a small team of five people, the organization is on  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:01:52):**  the forefront of agricultural community reinvigoration. So rather than butchering the description,  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:01:57):**  I'll hand things over now to Rachel Forster, who can explain everything much better.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:02:02):**  Hey Rachel, thank you so much for making the time to be here with us today. How are you?  
**[0:02:06-0:02:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:02:06):**  I'm really good, thanks Oliver. I'm in a very rainy, grey Cornwall in the southwest of England.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:02:13):**  Wow, you've definitely got to come and visit us out here in rural Guatemala. The weather  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:02:17):**  is perfect. I've got a view of the lake from my porch. It's sunny, but not too warm.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:02:22):**  How lovely. Yeah, you've got to start spending winters  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:02:25):**  out here with us. I'm heading your way.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:02:28):**  Well anyway, I've got a ton of things that I'd love to ask you. So what do you say we  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:02:32):**  just jump right into the questions? Yeah, sure.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:02:35):**  Fantastic. All right, let's get started. If you could tell us a little bit about your  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:02:39):**  personal background and how you got involved with the Tamar Grow Local organization and  
**[0:02:45-0:02:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:02:45):**  sort of how that idea sort of came to be. So my name is Rachel Forster and I work for  
**[0:02:54-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:02:54):**  Tamar Grow Local and we're a not-for-profit community interest company based in southwest  
**[0:03:01-0:03:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:03:01):**  England on the border between Cornwall and Devon. It's a rural area, a number of small  
**[0:03:08-0:03:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:03:08):**  villages that has a grand history of market garden and gardening and fruit and flower  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:03:16):**  production, which was in its heyday. It's run for hundreds of years since about the  
**[0:03:22-0:03:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:03:22):**  17th century with its heyday in the Victorian period, but saw a decline in the 1950s or  
**[0:03:31-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:03:31):**  so where the kind of introduction of European fruits and competition from growers abroad  
**[0:03:41-0:03:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:03:41):**  kind of had a real impact on the market gardening industry in this area. And also the two world  
**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:03:48):**  wars also had an impact on the workforce. So it started seeing a decline in the 1950s  
**[0:03:54-0:04:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:03:54):**  onwards and now there's only less than 20 market gardening families in the Tamar Valley.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:04:04):**  So Tamar Grow Local was set up in 2007 to look at reinvigorating food production in  
**[0:04:12-0:04:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:04:12):**  the Tamar Valley. It started off with just starting off a community allotment site, but  
**[0:04:20-0:04:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:04:20):**  over the next couple of years interest grew and there was interest in the communities  
**[0:04:27-0:04:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:04:27):**  for more food growing projects, which led to a small team being built at Tamar Grow  
**[0:04:34-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:04:34):**  Local, which includes myself and three others initially. And last year we've taken on two  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:04:42):**  more people. So a small team of five, I look after the kind of events and communications  
**[0:04:48-0:04:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:04:48):**  side of things, but we also have horticultural specialists, business manager, horticultural  
**[0:04:55-0:05:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:04:55):**  therapist and administration assistants as well. And we do a number of different projects,  
**[0:05:04-0:05:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:05:04):**  both community based and with small commercial enterprises such as community orchard sites,  
**[0:05:12-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:05:12):**  allotments, a honey cooperative, an apple juice cooperative. We run an online farmer's  
**[0:05:20-0:05:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:05:20):**  market and also manage a couple of projects in the city of Plymouth with Plymouth City  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:05:27):**  Council and Plymouth Community Homes, which is a social housing provider.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:05:32):**  That's quite a variety of things that you've got yourself into. What is the need within  
**[0:05:37-0:05:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:05:37):**  the community that this organization is meant to serve?  
**[0:05:41-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:05:41):**  So it's about building a sense of community around food. It's about building links with  
**[0:05:49-0:05:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:05:49):**  our growing heritage in this area and preserving the market gardening knowledge and encouraging  
**[0:05:59-0:06:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:05:59):**  people to eat seasonally and try out growing their own food and generally supporting our  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:06:07):**  kind of local food environment.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:06:10):**  Fantastic. And what have been some of the biggest hurdles in gaining support for your  
**[0:06:14-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:06:14):**  initiatives that you've come across so far?  
**[0:06:17-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:06:17):**  I think because we do a number of different projects, people can be kind of quite confused  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:06:28):**  about what we do or only be aware of kind of one aspect of what we do. And that's kind  
**[0:06:34-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:06:34):**  of been a bit of a hurdle in terms of communications, especially of kind of really getting out there  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:06:41):**  exactly what we do and how we can help people. And, you know, it's really nice that people  
**[0:06:45-0:06:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:06:45):**  will know us for one thing. Perhaps they just hold an allotment with us or perhaps they  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:06:52):**  only know us for our work in Plymouth. And what's a bit of a hurdle is getting people  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:06:56):**  to see the whole kind of sphere of everything that we do together.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:07:01):**  Yeah, absolutely. And can you give us a bit more of an idea of some of the products, the  
**[0:07:08-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:07:08):**  interconnected relationships within the community of growers that you've set up and any other  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:07:14):**  initiatives that are representative of the direction that your organization is moving?  
**[0:07:19-0:07:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:07:19):**  Yeah, sure. I mean, we're quite unique in that we have a kind of nesting approach to  
**[0:07:27-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:07:27):**  our different community projects that we do. I'm going to give you the example of Haribara  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:07:34):**  and Methel community orchard. It's Haribara and Methel are two villages very close to  
**[0:07:39-0:07:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:07:39):**  each other. And when Tamar Grow Local was setting up, the community was asked what kind  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:07:46):**  of projects they would like to see or kind of gaps in the local food provision. And some  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:07:52):**  members of the community suggested that an orchard where everyone could go and enjoy  
**[0:07:57-0:08:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:07:57):**  and share the fruit would be a great idea. So to kickstart that orchard, there was a  
**[0:08:06-0:08:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:08:06):**  small pot of funding that we received from a local organization. But the main aim was  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:08:12):**  to make sure that that's going to be sustainable in the future. So there's a number of different  
**[0:08:17-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:08:17):**  interwoven groups around the orchard, which bring different elements of the community  
**[0:08:24-0:08:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:08:24):**  in and to provide some different interests in food. So for instance, we had a community  
**[0:08:32-0:08:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:08:32):**  apiary in the orchard so people could come and learn about how to keep bees. They could  
**[0:08:39-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:08:39):**  pay in advance for three jars of the first harvest of honey. So we had a few people donating  
**[0:08:47-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:08:47):**  15 pounds and they would then receive back three jars of honey on the first harvest.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:08:53):**  And having that kind of initial little bit of money made sure that we could then buy  
**[0:08:58-0:09:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:08:58):**  the bees. The bees would then be in the orchard pollinating the trees. The orchard would then  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:09:08):**  attract different groups of people who would want to be involved with the grafting and  
**[0:09:12-0:09:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:09:12):**  the planting and perhaps the historic heritage value of the orchard. But what was interesting  
**[0:09:20-0:09:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:09:20):**  about the site was that it was an old floristry plantation. So it's covered in willow, which  
**[0:09:27-0:09:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:09:27):**  has become a real pain for clearing the land before we can plant apple trees. So then we  
**[0:09:34-0:09:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:09:34):**  thought about how we can clear this willow, which was invasive in the field. So we decided  
**[0:09:41-0:09:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:09:41):**  to set up a pig group. The pig group then attracted people who were interested in looking  
**[0:09:48-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:09:48):**  after pigs. The pigs then cleared the land ready to plant the apple trees. So they were  
**[0:09:55-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:09:55):**  our natural rotavators who did a great job. We had a group of eight pigs. It was quite  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:10:02):**  a long process because we had two rounds of pigs over two years until the ground was properly  
**[0:10:07-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:10:07):**  cleared until we could then flatten it ready to suitable for orchard planting. And that's  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:10:16):**  been a really successful project. It encourages families to get involved, to get involved  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:10:21):**  with food production, raising their own pigs for meat and having a really close link with  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:10:27):**  their food, which is exactly what Tamar Grow Local wants to do.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:10:31):**  Yeah. These are the things that I was really attracted to the organization for mainly that  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:10:39):**  you take a much more holistic approach to community development and stimulating the  
**[0:10:44-0:10:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:10:44):**  agricultural economy of your region by having so many varying enterprises in order to build  
**[0:10:49-0:10:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:10:49):**  resiliency. And you talked about a great example of kind of stacking functions and creating  
**[0:10:54-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:10:54):**  connections by having the pig farmers come in and clear out the weeds and the overgrowth  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:11:00):**  in the orchards. And obviously that serves some very obvious functions, but could you  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:11:05):**  talk about some of the other cooperations and connections between the enterprises that  
**[0:11:10-0:11:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:11:10):**  help to build resiliency for all of them? Yeah, sure. So if I lead the orchard into  
**[0:11:17-0:11:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:11:17):**  our apple cooperative, for instance, if the orchard ever has an excess of apples, they  
**[0:11:24-0:11:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:11:24):**  will be able to sell into Tamar Grow Local's apple cooperative, which pays a fair price  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:11:32):**  for apples that are grown in the Tamar Valley, which are then made into juice and sold under  
**[0:11:38-0:11:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:11:38):**  the origin label of Tamar Valley apple juice and Tamar Valley apple co-op. It's a retail  
**[0:11:46-0:11:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:11:46):**  product that's been developed with a number of different growers in the Tamar Valley who  
**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:11:54):**  have a lot of wastage of apples, a lot of old orchards that were growing commercially  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:12:00):**  that are no longer and a lot of the apple harvest gets wasted each year. So we are able  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:12:05):**  to buy, pay a fair price, which covers the cost of someone picking the apples and then  
**[0:12:11-0:12:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:12:11):**  we are making that for retail. And that apple co-op is open to anyone who has say two kilograms  
**[0:12:18-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:12:18):**  of apples or two tons of apples. We are able to accept any volume. And it's a really nice  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:12:28):**  project because it links the community. It also links with commercial enterprises. It  
**[0:12:33-0:12:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:12:33):**  puts a value on a product that is quite often wasted. It pays for someone a realistic price  
**[0:12:40-0:12:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:12:40):**  for them to pick the apples and sort through them and deliver to us. And it has a product  
**[0:12:47-0:12:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:12:47):**  with really strong local value that is also valued by local retailers as well.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:12:55):**  Marvelous. Yeah, I really like these cooperative initiatives that I've seen and especially  
**[0:12:59-0:13:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:12:59):**  yours that allow people with any size of farm or level of production to have access to a  
**[0:13:06-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:13:06):**  market that they wouldn't otherwise be able to get into for the volume of their production.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:13:13):**  And of course getting them a fair wage for it as well.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:13:17):**  Yeah, absolutely. I mean we also have the same with a honey cooperative. Again, we accept  
**[0:13:23-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:13:23):**  any volume of honey into that, which is really nice. We exceed the price that a lot of honey  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:13:32):**  producers and beekeepers, they will sell outside their houses or at their farm gate for instance,  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:13:38):**  and they'll receive a price there and Tamar Valley Honey cooperative is able to meet or  
**[0:13:43-0:13:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:13:43):**  improve on that price and create again a retail product that has a continuity of supply and  
**[0:13:53-0:13:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:13:53):**  we're able to meet that continuity of supply because we can accept from a number of different  
**[0:13:59-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:13:59):**  beekeepers and be able to create a commercial product that a lot of beekeepers, because  
**[0:14:08-0:14:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:14:08):**  they're part time do beekeeping as a hobby as well as holding a job, lots of them are  
**[0:14:15-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:14:15):**  unable to create their own products themselves to take to market. So it's something that  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:14:22):**  we can help with. We can take the raw honey, we'll bottle it, we'll label it and sell it  
**[0:14:28-0:14:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:14:28):**  for them. So it's great. We also have a honey extraction facility at our HQ and a lot of  
**[0:14:39-0:14:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:14:39):**  beekeepers, it can be a high investment to start beekeeping and to then have the extraction  
**[0:14:45-0:14:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:14:45):**  equipment. So we have a clean room with modern extraction equipment and beekeepers can come  
**[0:14:52-0:15:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:14:52):**  and extract their honey for a very low cost and then supply into our honey co-op or take  
**[0:15:00-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:15:00):**  their honey away. But then that extraction facility then supports the running costs of  
**[0:15:08-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:15:08):**  our HQ. It's a service to the local community and again it's an encouragement to people  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:15:15):**  to start beekeeping as well. Now aside from just helping along access to market for different  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:15:21):**  farmers, I know you actually go further up the chain and help people to get their enterprises  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:15:27):**  started. Especially land access is one of the biggest hurdles for many people wanting  
**[0:15:31-0:15:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:15:31):**  to get started in farming. How has Tamar worked to help aspiring farmers to gain access to  
**[0:15:37-0:15:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:15:37):**  land and the basic infrastructure to help them start producing? So we run a farm start  
**[0:15:44-0:15:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:15:44):**  called Mill Lane Acres and it's a farm start project where people can come to us with their  
**[0:15:51-0:15:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:15:51):**  horticultural business idea. It is purely for start-up businesses and say they want  
**[0:15:59-0:16:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:15:59):**  to try out a business idea, say for instance growing garlic. So we can at a low rent lease  
**[0:16:12-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:16:12):**  out to them one to three acres depending on their business plan and as part of that they  
**[0:16:19-0:16:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:16:19):**  receive a polytunnel and a water harvesting container, a thousand litre water harvesting  
**[0:16:26-0:16:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:16:26):**  container and they can also come to us for business advice or growing advice. We can  
**[0:16:35-0:16:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:16:35):**  hook them up with other local growers for any help they might need. For contract work  
**[0:16:43-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:16:43):**  that needs doing, for maintenance on the fields then it's nice because the tenants can all  
**[0:16:52-0:16:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:16:52):**  put in in the pot for getting any maintenance done by larger machinery and we can also as  
**[0:16:59-0:17:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:16:59):**  Tamar grow local help them to sell anything that they grow. It's one part obviously being  
**[0:17:06-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:17:06):**  able to grow something, a whole other part to then be able to market it and sell it efficiently  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:17:13):**  Certainly, I think that's one of the parts that many aspiring farmers overlook or don't  
**[0:17:18-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:17:18):**  realise just how much input and maintenance that requires. Marketing and finding access  
**[0:17:24-0:17:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:17:24):**  to consumers is often what people are not trained for as much as they can get their  
**[0:17:31-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:17:31):**  land to become productive.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:17:33):**  Yeah exactly and that's where another project of ours on earth links into this called Tamar  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:17:40):**  Valley Food Hubs. If any of you listeners want to have a look at what we do, you can  
**[0:17:46-0:17:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:17:46):**  have a look at tamarvalleyfoodhubs.org.uk. It's an online farmers market and we work  
**[0:17:53-0:18:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:17:53):**  with over 50 local producers and growers. It's not for profit so growers and producers  
**[0:18:02-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:18:02):**  receive 85% of the selling price and for that they get their online presence and we do the  
**[0:18:12-0:18:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:18:12):**  marketing and distribution every week of those different products. It's great for small  
**[0:18:21-0:18:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:18:21):**  growers and producers because we cover quite a large area so probably a 15 mile radius  
**[0:18:28-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:18:28):**  around where we are based in Callington. Every Friday we deliver out to the city of Plymouth,  
**[0:18:37-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:18:37):**  three market towns, Launston, Tavistock and Liscard and everywhere in between. It's  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:18:44):**  a really great way for producers no matter how much they've got to sell they can just  
**[0:18:50-0:18:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:18:50):**  tap in their items onto the website and they become ready to sell. The producer sets their  
**[0:18:56-0:19:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:18:56):**  own prices and they're completely in charge of the availability of that product so they  
**[0:19:03-0:19:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:19:03):**  might only want to sell three jars of jam through us or ten bunches of leeks and that's  
**[0:19:10-0:19:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:19:10):**  absolutely fine. It's open to growers of all sizes and the grower is in control of  
**[0:19:17-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:19:17):**  that pricing which is such a big issue in the UK. There's such an unrealistic pricing  
**[0:19:23-0:19:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:19:23):**  that you see in supermarkets. The vegetables and the milk and meat it's all very cheap  
**[0:19:30-0:19:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:19:30):**  and doesn't reflect the effort for farmers and growers to produce it.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:19:37):**  Yeah definitely the downside of globalism is that everyone is competing for these low  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:19:42):**  prices that wholesalers are trying to bargain down to and especially in places like the  
**[0:19:48-0:19:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:19:48):**  UK where wages are higher they're basically competing against other countries that either  
**[0:19:54-0:19:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:19:54):**  don't have a minimum wage or have a much much lower standard of living especially in rural  
**[0:19:58-0:20:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:19:58):**  areas and it makes it very uncompetitive for people in developed countries to basically  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:20:05):**  remain viable in their enterprises without undercutting their own livelihood.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:20:10):**  Absolutely and I think if things don't change then we risk losing our beautiful landscape,  
**[0:20:16-0:20:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:20:16):**  we risk losing our heritage and our cultures around food and I think it's enterprises  
**[0:20:24-0:20:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:20:24):**  like this although very small are really valuable and will hopefully encourage more people to  
**[0:20:33-0:20:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:20:33):**  kind of embrace local food and appreciate that through the quality that is coming to  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:20:40):**  them that it's worth paying a little bit more for.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:20:45):**  Yeah I couldn't agree more.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:20:46):**  But I mean saying that we're really competitive with a lot of products that are sold in the  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:20:50):**  supermarkets because we are working on such a local basis we haven't got the background  
**[0:20:56-0:21:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:20:56):**  costs of transport in from somewhere else or distribution out or storage. The produce  
**[0:21:06-0:21:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:21:06):**  comes in in the morning it's out in the afternoon in the local area and it's a great success.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:21:14):**  Well that's just it isn't it. Without cutting wages or fair compensation for the producers  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:21:20):**  there are a lot of ways to reduce overhead by eliminating inefficiencies and cutting  
**[0:21:25-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:21:25):**  out middlemen in the production system so that more money can go back to the pocket  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:21:32):**  of the producers and resources are sort of consolidated much in the way that you've done  
**[0:21:36-0:21:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:21:36):**  with your cooperatives.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:21:38):**  Yeah that's right. And you know the only way these small businesses and growers are going  
**[0:21:46-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:21:46):**  to be incentivized to expand their business or build their businesses is through being  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:21:52):**  paid a realistic price. So what we're trying to do is exactly what you're saying reducing  
**[0:21:57-0:22:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:21:57):**  efficiencies and kind of close up those gaps between the end consumer and the grower.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:22:05):**  That's fantastic. Now I'd like to go back to something that you mentioned a little bit  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:22:08):**  earlier and that's that I know you've partnered outside of just the rural area of the Tamar  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:22:13):**  Valley and are now working with the city of Plymouth and their healthy eating programs.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:22:18):**  Could you tell me a bit about how that partnership benefits both communities.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:22:23):**  So that's right. We are working with Plymouth City Council our local authority and also  
**[0:22:32-0:22:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:22:32):**  Plymouth Community Homes which is a social housing provider in the city as well. And  
**[0:22:40-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:22:40):**  the city of Plymouth has quite a lot of food inequalities but it is on the edge of our  
**[0:22:47-0:22:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:22:47):**  growing area agricultural area. So there's a lot of food being produced in the Tamar  
**[0:22:51-0:22:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:22:51):**  Valley which just doesn't making it into Plymouth and also not getting to the people who need  
**[0:22:58-0:23:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:22:58):**  it most. So Plymouth City Council with support from Nesta which is a global organization  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:23:07):**  and from Plymouth Community Homes developed a project called Grow Share Cook and what  
**[0:23:12-0:23:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:23:12):**  it did was encourage volunteers to share knowledge and to help grow food and then distribute  
**[0:23:23-0:23:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:23:23):**  it out to the people who needed it most. So we were delivering 100 bags every fortnight  
**[0:23:31-0:23:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:23:31):**  to 100 different households who were shown to be living with food inequality or with  
**[0:23:41-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:23:41):**  unhealthy diets or with various health and social issues. And it's a project where we  
**[0:23:48-0:23:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:23:48):**  delivered a bag of vegetables, five different locally grown vegetables each week some of  
**[0:23:56-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:23:56):**  which the recipients grew themselves and shared among others or which our Tamar Valley producers  
**[0:24:02-0:24:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:24:02):**  were growing. So again it's a project nested back with our local producers. They were getting  
**[0:24:09-0:24:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:24:09):**  a regular order of say 100 sweets every fortnight or 200 leeks every fortnight and it was a  
**[0:24:19-0:24:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:24:19):**  regular good order for them but linking them again in another Tamar local project. But  
**[0:24:27-0:24:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:24:27):**  it's a project that showed for every pound that was invested in this healthy eating program  
**[0:24:34-0:24:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:24:34):**  it received over 10 pound back in health benefits and social benefits that was verified by an  
**[0:24:41-0:24:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:24:41):**  independent audit. So it's been a program which has shown real results.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:24:48):**  Certainly, those are some very enviable statistics.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:24:51):**  Yeah, it had some really positive results both socially for the people who received  
**[0:24:57-0:25:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:24:57):**  the bags because they were also as part of the program given cookery lessons of how to  
**[0:25:04-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:25:04):**  prepare the vegetables. Found there was a lot of gaps in knowledge around cooking healthy  
**[0:25:14-0:25:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:25:14):**  fresh produce and so cookery lessons were a vital part of the project as well. And it  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:25:24):**  was also a great project because Plymouth City Council really took a holistic approach  
**[0:25:29-0:25:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:25:29):**  to this. So a lot of people if they are on low incomes and are worried about their energy  
**[0:25:36-0:25:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:25:36):**  bills for example, do you choose to put on your cooker and cook fresh food or do you  
**[0:25:44-0:25:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:25:44):**  pay for the heating for one day? It was a realistic issue for a lot of people living  
**[0:25:50-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:25:50):**  in the city that they had to choose between cooking or putting on their heating, putting  
**[0:25:56-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:25:56):**  on the cooker, putting on the radiator. And so Plymouth City Council also offered energy  
**[0:26:02-0:26:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:26:02):**  advice helping people to change energy providers and making sure that they had the best deal.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:26:08):**  So it's linking a lot of different issues together but focused around food which was  
**[0:26:14-0:26:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:26:14):**  really interesting. It's a great project.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:26:16):**  Fantastic. Now I've been really impressed to find… sorry go on.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:26:21):**  So I was just going to say we're in the third year of that project now and hopefully  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:26:26):**  we'll be continuing for the next few years because it is making a difference in the city.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:26:31):**  Yes certainly and to have accomplished so much in just three years is definitely enviable  
**[0:26:36-0:26:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:26:36):**  and certainly a model that I would love to see implemented in more community cooperations  
**[0:26:42-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:26:42):**  like this.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:26:43):**  Great. Now I've been impressed to find out just how many layers of support that Tamar  
**[0:26:49-0:26:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:26:49):**  has put in place to help local farmers succeed especially between resource sharing among  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:26:55):**  farmers, land access programs and the cooperative organizational structure that allows those  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:27:00):**  smaller producers better access to market. So my question is what are some of the areas  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:27:05):**  where you'd like the organization to move forward and provide even more resources in  
**[0:27:09-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:27:09):**  the future?  
**[0:27:10-0:27:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:27:10):**  So I think one of the main areas of growth that we'd really like to see is… I mentioned  
**[0:27:20-0:27:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:27:20):**  our online farmers market Tamar Valley Food Hubs. We're working… the background to  
**[0:27:25-0:27:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:27:25):**  that project now and the kind of software that we're using is an international open  
**[0:27:32-0:27:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:27:32):**  source software called Open Food Network. It's an organization that is being set up  
**[0:27:38-0:27:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:27:38):**  by a number of developers around the country and also around the world to provide continuity  
**[0:27:50-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:27:50):**  to a lot of different groups that are all doing the same thing. So there's a lot of  
**[0:27:54-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:27:54):**  online farmers markets around the country who are all getting to stage where they needed  
**[0:28:00-0:28:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:28:00):**  to kind of really modernize their shop fronts and so Open Food Network got together and  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:28:06):**  has developed this open source software to encourage other areas to set up their own  
**[0:28:11-0:28:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:28:11):**  farmers markets and local food organizations. And it's done remarkably well. It's being  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:28:20):**  used in a number of different countries now and I think that's something that my colleague  
**[0:28:25-0:28:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:28:25):**  Sarah is on the board of Open Food Network and it's got real possibilities for changing  
**[0:28:32-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:28:32):**  the way that people shop. I truly believe it. It's a great system. It's easy to  
**[0:28:38-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:28:38):**  use and I think that a lot of other groups will follow in taking up that and creating  
**[0:28:43-0:28:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:28:43):**  online food hubs in their own areas. It doesn't matter how big or small your organization  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:28:51):**  is if you've got some people producing food then let's get it out there.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:28:56):**  Yeah, excellent. That's very exciting stuff and I look forward to kind of following the  
**[0:29:00-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:29:00):**  progress as these years go on.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:29:03):**  Yeah, and also I think that the way we work is replicable in other areas as well. If you  
**[0:29:11-0:29:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:29:11):**  get into that system of linking different community projects together to make them more  
**[0:29:15-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:29:15):**  resilient it's something that can be used and replicated in other areas. It's not  
**[0:29:23-0:29:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:29:23):**  just our area and it can be replicated around the world. If you can start thinking of how  
**[0:29:30-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:29:30):**  to nest different projects together and how they work together and they become self reliant  
**[0:29:35-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:29:35):**  on each other and it's a good model.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:29:37):**  Yeah, absolutely. That actually transitions perfectly into my next question which is for  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:29:42):**  for how the people listening who are inspired by the initiatives of Tamar, how can they  
**[0:29:47-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:29:47):**  get to work on similar initiatives in order to get them established in their own communities?  
**[0:29:52-0:30:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:29:52):**  I mean, firstly, have a look at our website which is tamargrowlocal.org. We're a small  
**[0:30:02-0:30:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:30:02):**  very friendly team so we're more than happy to reply to inquiries and help people if they're  
**[0:30:09-0:30:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:30:09):**  interested in setting up food groups in their own areas then we'd love to hear from you.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:30:16):**  I can certainly vouch for that for how good you guys have been about staying in contact  
**[0:30:20-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:30:20):**  and keeping up with this interview.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:30:22):**  Yeah, I'd also recommend visiting the Open Food Network website which has a lot of inspirational  
**[0:30:28-0:30:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:30:28):**  stories around different food groups and yeah, it's finding some like minded people in your  
**[0:30:37-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:30:37):**  community. It's raising awareness about local food and the positive benefits that it can  
**[0:30:42-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:30:42):**  have for the environment and for your local community and for your local heritage and  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:30:48):**  it's then everything starts from really small projects. We started off with one allotment  
**[0:30:54-0:31:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:30:54):**  site now we manage I think probably 10 different projects at the moment and you know all great  
**[0:31:02-0:31:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:31:02):**  things start very small and it's been a slow build for Tamar Grow Local but one that has  
**[0:31:08-0:31:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:31:08):**  been sustainable and here's to the future. Hopefully we'll be here in another 10 years  
**[0:31:14-0:31:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:31:14):**  and celebrating our test with the nursery. But yeah, it starts with enthusiasm I think  
**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:31:22):**  a lot of the time but then grows into good things.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:31:27):**  Well I can assure you there's no lack of enthusiasm from the listeners of this podcast. They are  
**[0:31:31-0:31:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:31:31):**  very passionate about seeing positive and regenerative change in their communities and  
**[0:31:36-0:31:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:31:36):**  throughout the world so I really hope this helps to inspire them and see how such a diverse  
**[0:31:43-0:31:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:31:43):**  and holistic model for rural community sort of regeneration and coaxing it back into the  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:31:52):**  level of productivity that it's capable of even within the challenges of competing in  
**[0:31:57-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:31:57):**  a globalized market will help to inspire people to basically attempt similar initiatives in  
**[0:32:04-0:32:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:32:04):**  their own communities like we talked about. Yeah that's it. Yeah.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:32:08):**  So now before I let you go could you tell us how any of the listeners today could possibly  
**[0:32:14-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:32:14):**  get in touch with your organization in order to help out directly or you know like you  
**[0:32:20-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:32:20):**  said you're very open to receiving inquiries and to help people sort of with advice on  
**[0:32:25-0:32:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rachael-forster-tamar-grow-local/#t=0:32:25):**  how to start their own initiatives. Are there any other resources that you'd be able to
